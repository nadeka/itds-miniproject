MILTON	I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
BERNICE	That's very nice of you. Thank you.

BERNICE	Ah, won't you sit down?
MILTON	Thank you. Cream?
BERNICE	No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
MILTON	Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
BERNICE	Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
MILTON	No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.

MILTON	After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
BERNICE	Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
MILTON	But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
BERNICE	Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
MILTON	I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
BERNICE	I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
MILTON	You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
BERNICE	Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
MILTON	That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'

MILTON	I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
BERNICE	No. I'm all alone.
MILTON	Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
BERNICE	That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.

CAREY	Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
MRS. KRAMER	Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.

MRS. KRAMER	Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
CAREY	Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
MRS. KRAMER	Something about a plane with no pilot?

CAREY	Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
MRS. KRAMER	Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.

CAREY	...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
MRS. KRAMER	Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.

STRIKER	Both pilots!
DR. RUMACK	Can you fly this airplane and land it?
STRIKER	Surely you can't be serious.
DR. RUMACK	I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
STRIKER	Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!

DR. RUMACK	Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
STRIKER	Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.

DR. RUMACK	...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
STRIKER	Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?

DR. RUMACK	Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
STRIKER	Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
DR. RUMACK	I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
STRIKER	Surely there must be something you can do.
DR. RUMACK	I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!

STRIKER	George Zipp said that?
DR. RUMACK	And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
STRIKER	Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.

DR. RUMACK	Captain, how soon can we land?
OVEUR	I can't tell.

DR. RUMACK	Can't you take a guess?
OVEUR	Well...not for another two hours.
DR. RUMACK	You can't take a guess for another two hours?
OVEUR	No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!

OVEUR	What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
DR. RUMACK	I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.

ELAINE	Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
DR. RUMACK	That's right.
ELAINE	We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
DR. RUMACK	Yes. Yes, of course.

DR. RUMACK	You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
ELAINE	A hospital? What is it?
DR. RUMACK	It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
ELAINE	Certainly.

DR. RUMACK	What was it we had for dinner tonight?
ELAINE	Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
DR. RUMACK	Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.

DR. RUMACK	What did he have?
ELAINE	He had fish.

ELAINE	Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
DR. RUMACK	Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
ELAINE	He had fish, too.

ELAINE	Just how serious is it, doctor?
DR. RUMACK	Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.

DR. RUMACK	Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
ELAINE	No.
DR. RUMACK	All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
ELAINE	Well...

ELAINE	No. No one that I know of.
DR. RUMACK	I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.

STRIKER	Elaine!
ELAINE	Ted!
STRIKER	I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
ELAINE	I just don't want to go over it any more.
STRIKER	I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
ELAINE	I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
STRIKER	Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
ELAINE	It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!

STRIKER	Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
ELAINE	I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
STRIKER	Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
ELAINE	Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

STRIKER	You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
ELAINE	Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
STRIKER	You expect me to believe that?

ELAINE	It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
STRIKER	But if you'll just give me...
ELAINE	It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.

ELAINE	Ted, what are you doing here?
STRIKER	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
ELAINE	You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.

ELAINE	What's the matter?
STRIKER	My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
ELAINE	Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
STRIKER	I love you, Elaine.
ELAINE	I love you.

STRIKER	Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
ELAINE	I remember everything. All I have are memories.

ELAINE	Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
STRIKER	That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
ELAINE	But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!

ELAINE	You got a telegram from headÂ­quarters today.
STRIKER	Headquarters!? What is it?
ELAINE	It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?

STRIKER	Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
ELAINE	Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?

STRIKER	I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
ELAINE	Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.

ELAINE	What's his problem?
STRIKER	That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

STRIKER	I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
ELAINE	Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
STRIKER	A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.

ELAINE	Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
STRIKER	That's what I've been trying to tell these people.

ELAINE	Rain.
STRIKER	And a little ice.
ELAINE	And a little ice!

STRIKER	Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
ELAINE	Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

STRIKER	It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
ELAINE	It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.

STRIKER	Rats! I've lost number three.
ELAINE	What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
STRIKER	Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.

ELAINE	But Ted, you're the only...
STRIKER	I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.

ELAINE	Ted...
STRIKER	Yes?
ELAINE	I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
STRIKER	Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
ELAINE	The gear is down.

STRIKER	See them, Elaine?
ELAINE	Uh-huh.

ELAINE	We have a visitor.
OVEUR	Hello.

ELAINE	We'd better get back now.
OVEUR	Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.

OVEUR	Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
ELAINE	Who wants to be first?

OVEUR	Airsick?
ELAINE	I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
OVEUR	Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.

GIRL	Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
SOLDIER	You promise you'll write.
GIRL	Every day.

SOLDIER	Good-bye, darling.
GIRL	Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
SOLDIER	So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
GIRL	Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
SOLDIER	Good-bye, darling.
GIRL	Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
SOLDIER	Good-bye, darling.

KRAMER	And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
GUNDERSON	Yes, Captain?
KRAMER	Did you decide on a runway yet?
GUNDERSON	Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.

GUNDERSON	Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
KRAMER	You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.

GUNDERSON	He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
KRAMER	Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.

GUNDERSON	He's right on the heading.
KRAMER	All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.

SHIRLEY	Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
JACK	Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!

JACK	What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
SHIRLEY	Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.

SHIRLEY	Oh, I can't stand it.
JACK	What is it?

JACK	How ya doing, honey?
SHIRLEY	Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
JACK	Here.

JOEY	Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
MURDOCK	I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.

JOEY	You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
MURDOCK	I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

MURDOCK	I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
JOEY	I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
MURDOCK	Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
JOEY	...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
MURDOCK	We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
JOEY	...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
MURDOCK	The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.

LISA	Hi!
RANDY	I'm Randy.
LISA	I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
RANDY	I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
LISA	Oh, I'd love to.
RANDY	Okay, this is one of my favorites.

RANDY	Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
MRS. HAMMEN	I will, but Jim won't.

RANDY	Yes?
MRS. HAMMEN	Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
RANDY	Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
MRS. HAMMEN	Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
RANDY	Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.

MURDOCK	Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
OVEUR	Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.

OVEUR	Roger.
MURDOCK	Huh?

OVEUR	Roger.
MURDOCK	Huh?

MURDOCK	We have clearance, Clarence.
OVEUR	Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?

MURDOCK	Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
OVEUR	No, why don't you take care ot it?

OVEUR	No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
MURDOCK	All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.

RANDY	Excuse me, Sister?
SISTER ANGELINA	Yes?
RANDY	There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
SISTER ANGELINA	Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
RANDY	Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
SISTER ANGELINA	Of course.

RANDY	Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
STRIKER	Thank you.

RANDY	Do you feel all right, sir?
STRIKER	Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.

RANDY	Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
STRIKER	No. No thank you.

RANDY	Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
STRIKER	The cockpit? What is it?
RANDY	It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?

STRIKER	Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
RANDY	Would you go up, please?

RANDY	Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
STRIKER	Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.

BOB	Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...

BOB	Yes, sir. 
GROUCHO	Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.

MRS. TEASDALE	I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
CHICO	Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
MRS. TEASDALE	Yes -- why?
CHICO	I wanna powder my nose...

MRS. TEASDALE	In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
CHICO	He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.

MRS. TEASDALE	What's the matter with you?
CHICO	What's the matter with you?
MRS. TEASDALE	You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
CHICO	I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.

GROUCHO	Hey you!!
CHICO	All right -

GROUCHO	Have you got a license?
CHICO	No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
GROUCHO	What kind of a dog is he?
CHICO	He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
GROUCHO	Well - what is he now?
CHICO	He's half poodle and half watch dog -
GROUCHO	Half watch dog?
CHICO	Yeh, he's only got one eye.
GROUCHO	I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
CHICO	I don't call him, I whistle.
GROUCHO	What do you whistle?
CHICO	Yankee Poodle.
GROUCHO	I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
CHICO	I don't want him.
GROUCHO	Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
CHICO	He only weighs ten ounces --
GROUCHO	I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.

CHICO	That was for you.
GROUCHO	I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
CHICO	Oh no, I can't do it.
GROUCHO	You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
CHICO	Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
GROUCHO	You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
CHICO	'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
GROUCHO	Did you shoot the rapids?
CHICO	No, but I shot some ducks.
GROUCHO	If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
CHICO	Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
GROUCHO	Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --

CHICO	Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
GROUCHO	I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
CHICO	What other job you got?
GROUCHO	Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
CHICO	That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
GROUCHO	Then you don't wanna work hard?
CHICO	I don't wanna work at all.
GROUCHO	In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
CHICO	I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
GROUCHO	Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
CHICO	Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
GROUCHO	I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
CHICO	'At's-a fine.

GROUCHO	You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
CHICO	What do I get?
GROUCHO	You get half mine and I get half yours.
CHICO	I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
GROUCHO	Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
CHICO	Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.

GROUCHO	My card.
CHICO	That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
GROUCHO	Why wasn't I insulted?
CHICO	You was insulted, but you don't know it.
GROUCHO	Then I demand an apology!
CHICO	That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
GROUCHO	You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
CHICO	He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
GROUCHO	Why didn't his niece slap your face?
CHICO	She did.
GROUCHO	What did you say to her?

GROUCHO	You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
CHICO	You told it to me.
GROUCHO	Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.

GROUCHO	Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
CHICO	I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.

CHICO	Send in the next girl. 
GROUCHO	By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
CHICO	Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?

GROUCHO	I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
CHICO	We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?

CHICO	He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
GROUCHO	That's not bad for any day.

GROUCHO	You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
CHICO	I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...

CHICO	You no gotta no gun.
GROUCHO	Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --

GROUCHO	Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
CHICO	I can't do it...
GROUCHO	Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
CHICO	Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
GROUCHO	Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.

GROUCHO	Now -- how many men you got in your army?
CHICO	Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
GROUCHO	That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
CHICO	That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
GROUCHO	That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
CHICO	No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
GROUCHO	Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
CHICO	We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
GROUCHO	I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
CHICO	I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
GROUCHO	That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
CHICO	That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
GROUCHO	Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
CHICO	Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.

GROUCHO	With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
CHICO	That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
GROUCHO	Anything else? 
CHICO	Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
GROUCHO	Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
CHICO	Fine.  We gotta him. 
GROUCHO	So! -- He's on your side, too.
CHICO	Sure.
GROUCHO	Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.

CHICO	How'm I doing, boss?
TRENTINO	Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
CHICO	He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S

TRENTINO	Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
CHICO	All right -- I'll go out and find one.
TRENTINO	Firefly must be captured at any cost.
CHICO	That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
TRENTINO	It must be done right away.
CHICO	I can't do it right away.

ENSEMBLE	We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
GROUCHO	If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
ENSEMBLE	If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
GROUCHO	If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 

GROUCHO	I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
ENSEMBLE	So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
GROUCHO	If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
ENSEMBLE	The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
GROUCHO	The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.

VERA	Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
GROUCHO	You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 

GROUCHO	You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
VERA	Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.

VERA	Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
GROUCHO	Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...

VERA	I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
GROUCHO	This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
VERA	Are you getting tired?
GROUCHO	Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.

VERA	Are you sure you're not tired?
GROUCHO	Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -

GROUCHO	That's even a greater honor.
TRENTINO	I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
GROUCHO	I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
TRENTINO	Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
GROUCHO	Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
TRENTINO	$50?
GROUCHO	I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
TRENTINO	Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
GROUCHO	Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.

TRENTINO	Excellency, may I present my niece.
GROUCHO	Go ahead.
TRENTINO	You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
GROUCHO	And Vera niece, too.

GROUCHO	When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
TRENTINO	Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
GROUCHO	What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.

TRENTINO	This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
GROUCHO	Well, why not say the least and get it over with?

GROUCHO	That's what you think.
TRENTINO	You swine!
GROUCHO	Give me that again!
TRENTINO	You worm!
GROUCHO	Once more! 
TRENTINO	You upstart!
GROUCHO	That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.

GROUCHO	Then it's war?
TRENTINO	Yes.
GROUCHO	How're ya fixed for ammunition?
TRENTINO	Bah!! 
GROUCHO	THEN IT'S WAR!

TRENTINO	I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
GROUCHO	Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
TRENTINO	I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
GROUCHO	Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...

TRENTINO	What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
GROUCHO	I don't remember.
TRENTINO	Oh -- you mean... worm?
GROUCHO	No, that wasn't it...
TRENTINO	Was it -- swine?
GROUCHO	No... it was a seven letter word.
TRENTINO	Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
GROUCHO	That's it...

TRENTINO	Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
GROUCHO	I still like UPSTART the best.

MRS. TEASDALE	What'll I do with this card?
GROUCHO	You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?

MRS. TEASDALE	In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
GROUCHO	Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
MRS. TEASDALE	The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
GROUCHO	I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
MRS. TEASDALE	Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
GROUCHO	No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
MRS. TEASDALE	Your Excellency!
GROUCHO	You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.

MRS. TEASDALE	Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
GROUCHO	Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
MRS. TEASDALE	If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
GROUCHO	These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...

MRS. TEASDALE	You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
GROUCHO	That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
MRS. TEASDALE	Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
GROUCHO	I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
MRS. TEASDALE	Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
GROUCHO	He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?

MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, Rufus!
GROUCHO	All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
GROUCHO	I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.

GROUCHO	So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
MRS. TEASDALE	But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
GROUCHO	Let him patch up his own breeches...

MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, won't you reconsider...
GROUCHO	Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 

GROUCHO	Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
MRS. TEASDALE	Now -- er --
GROUCHO	Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.

GROUCHO	Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
MRS. TEASDALE	Why -- why -- of course.
GROUCHO	You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...

MRS. TEASDALE	I hope I'm not interrupting.
GROUCHO	Take a seat -- you're next. 
MRS. TEASDALE	Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
GROUCHO	That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.

MRS. TEASDALE	My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
GROUCHO	WHAT  ?

MRS. TEASDALE	I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
GROUCHO	Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
MRS. TEASDALE	I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
GROUCHO	THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
MRS. TEASDALE	But -
GROUCHO	You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?

GROUCHO	You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
MRS. TEASDALE	The king can do no wrong!

MRS. TEASDALE	Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
TRENTINO	What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
MRS. TEASDALE	Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
TRENTINO	Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.

TRENTINO	...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
MRS. TEASDALE	Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
TRENTINO	Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
MRS. TEASDALE	Well no -- not exactly -- but --
TRENTINO	Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?

MRS. TEASDALE	Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
TRENTINO	I didn't come here to be insulted.

TRENTINO	I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
MRS. TEASDALE	This is terrible!

TRENTINO	Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, would you...?
TRENTINO	For you, I would do anything... 

VERA	So that's the one you want to marry.
TRENTINO	With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
VERA	Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
TRENTINO	That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.

VERA	Uncle, you can't do this!
TRENTINO	My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
VERA	It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...

TRENTINO	This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
VERA	I thought everything was working out fine.
TRENTINO	Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
VERA	Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --

VERA	If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
TRENTINO	Perhaps he will listen to you...

DAD	Have you seen my blue spatula?
ENID	Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
DAD	Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.

ENID	Will you get off my back for once?
DAD	It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
ENID	Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
DAD	Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
ENID	Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.

DAD	Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
ENID	Who?
DAD	Guess.
ENID	How should I know?
DAD	Someone from the past.
ENID	Who?
DAD	Give up?
ENID	YES.
DAD	Maxine.
ENID	Not the Maxine?
DAD	Yup.
ENID	God, how horrifying.

ENID	Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
DAD	I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
ENID	I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.

DAD	I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
ENID	What is it now?
DAD	Are you still looking for a job?
ENID	I guess.
DAD	Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
ENID	Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.

DAD	Pumpkin? What's wrong?
ENID	Nothing.

ENID	It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
DAD	I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
ENID	What?
DAD	Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.

DAD	Pumpkin, are you in there?
ENID	Are you going to yell at me?
DAD	About what?
DAD	Yeah, I heard about that.
ENID	I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
DAD	She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
ENID	I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
DAD	Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
ENID	What do you mean "on his way up"!?
DAD	I just buzzed him in.

ENID	What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
DAD	But I can't --
ENID	JUST DO IT!

SEYMOUR	That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
DANA	Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?

DANA	Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
SEYMOUR	Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
DANA	Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
DANA	Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
SEYMOUR	Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
DANA	Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
SEYMOUR	No, really I --

SEYMOUR	Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
DANA	Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.

DANA	I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
SEYMOUR	Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
DANA	Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?

DANA	Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
SEYMOUR	Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
DANA	Hello...

DANA	Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
SEYMOUR	Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
DANA	We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!

DANA	Hey... so, what brings you down here?
SEYMOUR	I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
DANA	What are you trying to say?
SEYMOUR	It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.

SEYMOUR	I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
DANA	Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
SEYMOUR	Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
DANA	I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!

ROBERTA	And what can you tell us about this... 
ENID	Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.

ROBERTA	Who is this, Enid?
ENID	It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
ROBERTA	And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
ENID	I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
ROBERTA	I see... interesting...

ROBERTA	These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
ENID	Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
ROBERTA	Did you actually do this painting?
ENID	Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
ROBERTA	And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
ENID	It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
ROBERTA	And how does an image like this help us to see that?
ENID	I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?

ROBERTA	Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
ENID	Uh-oh.
ROBERTA	Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
ENID	I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
ROBERTA	Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.

ENID	Hmm.
ROBERTA	As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
ENID	...wow...
ROBERTA	So what do you think?
ENID	I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
ROBERTA	Well, yes...
ENID	I...
ROBERTA	Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.

ROBERTA	Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
ENID	What do you mean?
ROBERTA	The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
ENID	Huh?
ROBERTA	Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
ENID	I didn't check my messages...
ROBERTA	Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
ENID	Help me what?
ROBERTA	Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
ENID	But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
ROBERTA	I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --

MANAGER	I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
ENID	You can count on me, sir!

MANAGER	What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
ENID	Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
MANAGER	Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
ENID	But I was only trying to be friendly...
MANAGER	Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
ENID	Okay, okay... I won't say a word...

MANAGER	What the hell is wrong with you?!
ENID	What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
MANAGER	Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
ENID	But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
MANAGER	It's not optional!
ENID	Jesus...

ENID	Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
JOSH	Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
ENID	What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
JOSH	Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
ENID	I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --

ENID	So Josh...
JOSH	Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.

ENID	That guy rules!
JOSH	Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
ENID	So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
JOSH	No.

JOSH	Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
ENID	It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.

JOSH	Aren't there a million places like this?
ENID	This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
JOSH	So, where's "Weird Al"?
ENID	SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.

JOSH	Yeah, right.
ENID	No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.

ENID	That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
JOSH	In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
ENID	I figured something like that...

JOSH	Jesus, look at this guy.
ENID	Oh my God, that's HIM!

JOSH	Forget it.
ENID	Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
JOSH	No.
ENID	But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
JOSH	You need counseling.

ENID	Hi Josh.
JOSH	Hi.
ENID	I just stopped in to say hi.
JOSH	Yeah, well... hi...

JOSH	Hi... what's up?
ENID	Can I come in?

JOSH	Are you the one who left that note?
ENID	I guess.

JOSH	Do you want something to drink?
ENID	Why?
JOSH	What do you mean "why"?
ENID	Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
JOSH	Yeah, right...
ENID	Yeah, right... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
JOSH	Nothing.
ENID	Then why do you hate me so much?
JOSH	When did I say I hated you?
ENID	You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
JOSH	You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
ENID	That's just the way I am!
JOSH	Yeah, well --
ENID	It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!

JOSH	You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
ENID	Why do you have that stupid poster?

JOSH	Oh, hi...
ENID	Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
JOSH	How long have you been up?
ENID	I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
JOSH	Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
ENID	I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
JOSH	Why not?
ENID	Because if you do, I'll kill you!
JOSH	Okay... I promise.
ENID	Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...

JOSH	Hi Enid.
ENID	Hey Josh.
JOSH	Are you ready to go?

ENID	God, what a bunch of retards...
REBECCA	I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
ENID	I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
REBECCA	It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...

ENID	What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
REBECCA	What?
ENID	These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
REBECCA	Why?
ENID	Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
REBECCA	You loser.

REBECCA	This is so bad, it's almost good.
ENID	This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...

ENID	Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
REBECCA	Unless they're in your Summer school class!
ENID	Shut up!
REBECCA	Uh oh... don't turn around...
ENID	What? Why?
REBECCA	Forget it...

ENID	Since when is she an "actress"?
REBECCA	I know, she needs to die immediately.

ENID	Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
REBECCA	How perfect.
ENID	He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.

ENID	God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
REBECCA	Good.
ENID	God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.

REBECCA	Hi.
ENID	Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
REBECCA	Why?
ENID	Just look at them!

REBECCA	So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
ENID	Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
REBECCA	Did you sign up yet?
ENID	Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
REBECCA	God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
ENID	I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.

REBECCA	Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
ENID	We should follow them!

REBECCA	Much later.
ENID	In fact, never.

REBECCA	What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
ENID	You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
REBECCA	That lets us off the hook.

ENID	Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
REBECCA	Or maybe not.
ENID	Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
REBECCA	Okay, okay!
ENID	Hey, look at this...

ENID	Authentic 50's diner? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
REBECCA	God, it's so totally pathetic.

REBECCA	Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
ENID	I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!

ENID	Hi, Al!
REBECCA	Can we call you "Weird Al"?

REBECCA	I might actually get the pasta special.
ENID	You loser!

ENID	Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
REBECCA	I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
ENID	What does that even mean?

REBECCA	Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
ENID	God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
REBECCA	You can have that one.
ENID	Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
REBECCA	Gross.

ENID	Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
REBECCA	God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
ENID	I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
REBECCA	We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
ENID	Oh, we totally have to.

ENID	Does Oomie really like this show?
REBECCA	Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.

REBECCA	So what should we do?
ENID	Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
REBECCA	What is this?
ENID	I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.

ENID	Hey - why do you have this?
REBECCA	You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
ENID	I've been looking all over for this.

ENID	Look at how cute I am!
REBECCA	What a little hosebag.

ENID	Look, that's back when I hated you.
REBECCA	I remember every minute of that party.
ENID	There's my dad with Joanie.
REBECCA	I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
ENID	No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!

REBECCA	I want to do him!
ENID	I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
REBECCA	What are you talking about -- who?
ENID	That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
REBECCA	Fuck you!

REBECCA	Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
ENID	Which loser?
REBECCA	You know, the green cardigan guy.
ENID	Oh yeah.

REBECCA	You call.
ENID	Why do I always have to do it?
REBECCA	You're better at it.
ENID	I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
REBECCA	What does it stand for?
ENID	Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.

ENID	God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
REBECCA	I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
ENID	Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!

REBECCA	Look, maybe that's him!
ENID	It's still twenty-five minutes early.

REBECCA	I want to "make love" to him.
ENID	I'm going to tell him you said that.

REBECCA	SHUT UP!
ENID	She says she wants to MMPH!

ENID	Is he wearing a green cardigan?
REBECCA	What exactly is a cardigan anyway?

ENID	It's obviously him!
REBECCA	I can't believe it!

REBECCA	What's going on now? What's he doing?
ENID	Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!

REBECCA	What's he doing now?
ENID	He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!

REBECCA	Do you think he knows?
ENID	I dunno...

REBECCA	Are you sure?
ENID	Totally! Look!

ENID	He's insane!
REBECCA	We should follow him home.

ENID	He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
REBECCA	I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
ENID	This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.

ENID	This is way too creepy.
REBECCA	He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
ENID	I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.

REBECCA	The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
ENID	Bingo!

REBECCA	What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
ENID	Come on, it's too late now...

ENID	Ew, look at this...
REBECCA	Gross!
ENID	I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
REBECCA	Ew, it's like some gross rat...

REBECCA	That was truly pathetic.
ENID	I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."

REBECCA	He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
ENID	It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
REBECCA	What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
ENID	Oh yeah...
REBECCA	He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
ENID	I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
REBECCA	That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
ENID	Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
REBECCA	Not really...
ENID	Forget it, I can't explain it...

ENID	We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
REBECCA	Somewhere downtown.

REBECCA	Funky?
ENID	What, is she black now?

REBECCA	I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
ENID	What are you talking about?
REBECCA	That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
ENID	You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
REBECCA	Just promise you'll do it.
ENID	Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.

ENID	What? How long have you been standing there?
REBECCA	Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
ENID	Fuck you, bitch!

ENID	We still have to go in there sometime.
REBECCA	It's always closed...
ENID	I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.

REBECCA	Where are we going?
ENID	Let's go hassle Josh.
REBECCA	Hassle?

REBECCA	There he is...
ENID	As always.
REBECCA	Waiting for the bus that never comes...
ENID	I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
REBECCA	Why don't you ask him.

ENID	JOSH!
REBECCA	JOSH!

REBECCA	I'll bet he never jerks off...
ENID	Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
REBECCA	Should we leave a note?

REBECCA	Why are we going here? I hate this place.
ENID	It'll only take a second.

REBECCA	What was that all about?
ENID	It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
REBECCA	I didn't get it either.
ENID	Everybody's too stupid!

REBECCA	How about this one?
ENID	Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.

REBECCA	Ew ... when did you get that?
ENID	This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
REBECCA	God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?

REBECCA	How about this?
ENID	Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.

ENID	Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
REBECCA	We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
ENID	I know a party we could go to...
REBECCA	What? Where?!
ENID	It's a surprise.
REBECCA	I don't believe you.
ENID	If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?

REBECCA	I totally, totally hate you.
ENID	Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.

ENID	I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
REBECCA	Wait...

ENID	Give me all your money, bitch!
REBECCA	Where did you get that?
ENID	You won't believe it! Guess!
REBECCA	Where?
ENID	Anthony's II!
REBECCA	No way... when?
ENID	Just now... I went with Seymour.
REBECCA	You cunt!

ENID	That guy is totally amazing.
REBECCA	He does that every single day.

ENID	God, how can you stand all these assholes?
REBECCA	I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
ENID	At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
REBECCA	He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
ENID	That rules!
REBECCA	No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
ENID	But those are our people...
REBECCA	Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
ENID	I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
REBECCA	Like what?
ENID	Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
REBECCA	God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.

REBECCA	...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
ENID	I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
REBECCA	You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
ENID	Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
REBECCA	You're gross.  See that guy?
ENID	Which one?
REBECCA	He gives me a total boner!
ENID	He's like the biggest idiot of all time!

REBECCA	You're just jealous.
ENID	Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
REBECCA	Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
ENID	That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
REBECCA	Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
ENID	...maybe we should be lesbos...
REBECCA	Get away from me!

REBECCA	Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
ENID	Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
REBECCA	When are you finally going to get your diploma?
ENID	I dunno, but next week is my last class...
REBECCA	Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
ENID	Wasn't it like eighth grade?
REBECCA	Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
ENID	That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
REBECCA	I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
ENID	We were such desperate sluts back then.

REBECCA	What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
ENID	I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...

REBECCA	This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
ENID	Fuck it. Everything must go!
REBECCA	Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...

REBECCA	What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
ENID	Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.

REBECCA	Now are you going to get a regular job?
ENID	Don't worry.
REBECCA	If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
ENID	Yeah, thanks.

REBECCA	Do you want to do something tonight?
ENID	I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
REBECCA	Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
ENID	Yeah, I guess... call me...

ENID	I think one of us should fuck Josh...
REBECCA	Go ahead...
ENID	No, really...
REBECCA	God, you're really obsessed...
ENID	I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
REBECCA	I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
ENID	Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
REBECCA	No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.

REBECCA	Look, we have to get these...
ENID	I can't afford stuff like this right now.
REBECCA	I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
ENID	Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
REBECCA	Don't you want nice stuff?
ENID	I can't imagine spending money on towels.
REBECCA	You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
ENID	You're insane.
REBECCA	Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
ENID	What thing?
REBECCA	That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
ENID	Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
REBECCA	God, I'm so sick of Seymour.

REBECCA	Hello?
ENID	Do you still want to do something tonight?
REBECCA	What happened to Seymour?
ENID	I can't believe it - he actually scored!
REBECCA	How repulsive!
ENID	So should I come over?
REBECCA	Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
ENID	What are you talking about? Who?
REBECCA	Just some people from work...
ENID	I don't believe you.
REBECCA	Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.

ENID	Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
REBECCA	It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
ENID	I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
REBECCA	Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
ENID	What? When did you see Josh?!
REBECCA	He came into work.
ENID	Why? What did he say?
REBECCA	Nothing.
ENID	When was this?
REBECCA	I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.

REBECCA	Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
ENID	Great...
REBECCA	What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
ENID	I said "great"...
REBECCA	Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
ENID	Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
REBECCA	There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
ENID	Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.

REBECCA	You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
ENID	You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
REBECCA	FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!

REBECCA	Hello?
ENID	I need to talk to you.

ENID	I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
REBECCA	I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
ENID	Please let me come with you. Please please please...
REBECCA	I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
ENID	Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
REBECCA	But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
ENID	I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.

REBECCA	So, whaddya think?
ENID	It's fine.
REBECCA	So where's all your stuff?

ENID	There.
REBECCA	That's all you're bringing?
ENID	I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
REBECCA	What time?
ENID	I dunno...
REBECCA	Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!

ENID	Hi.
REBECCA	Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
ENID	You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
REBECCA	Actually, he's a really nice guy.

REBECCA	Do you want anything?
ENID	Maybe an orange juice.

REBECCA	Wow... finally.
ENID	It just came yesterday...

ENID	What about me? Am I not even here?
TODD	Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!

ENID	We're not.
TODD	Really? Both of you?... Why not?
ENID	Just because.

ENID	What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
TODD	Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
ENID	See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 

MELORRA	Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
ENID	Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
MELORRA	So what are you guys doing this Summer?
ENID	Nothing.
MELORRA	I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
ENID	Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
MELORRA	Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!

MELORRA	Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
ENID	What are you doing here, Melorra?
MELORRA	My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
ENID	Well, we won't keep you.
MELORRA	I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."

MAXINE	It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
ENID	I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.

MAXINE	May I ask what you're doing?
ENID	Shhh!
MAXINE	I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
ENID	Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
MAXINE	Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.

ENID	A what?
JOE	A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
ENID	How much is this?
JOE	Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.

JOE	Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
ENID	That's okay...

ENID	Do you have any other old records besides these?
JOE	Seymour does.
ENID	Who does?
JOE	Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.

JOE	You still interested in that?
ENID	I thought it wasn't for sale.
JOE	I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
ENID	It's kind of falling apart.

JOE	Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
ENID	Where did you get those pants?

JOHN ELLIS	Didn't they tell you?
ENID	Tell me what?
JOHN ELLIS	Punk rock is over!
ENID	I know it's over, asshole, I --
JOHN ELLIS	If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
ENID	That's not even --
JOHN ELLIS	Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?

JOHN ELLIS	Oh, how "punk."
ENID	That tape sucked, by the way!
JOHN ELLIS	I'm so sorry if you were offended!

ENID	Go die, asshole!
JOHN ELLIS	Get a job!

ENID	Hi... what's your name?
MAN	Norman.
ENID	...are you waiting for a bus?
MAN	Yes.
ENID	I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
MAN	You don't know what you're talking about.

JOHN	Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
ENID	You're late, asshole.
JOHN	Fine, and how are you?
ENID	Did you bring that tape?

JOHN	You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
ENID	I did too!
JOHN	Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
ENID	Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!

ENID	Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
JOHN	Hey, where are you going?
ENID	Later, "Dude".

ENID	That's five hundred dollars.
GIRL	What?
ENID	Five hundred.
GIRL	You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
ENID	I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
GIRL	Well why do I care about that?
ENID	Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
GIRL	God, fuck you!

ENID	Do you have any old Indian records?
SEYMOUR	Indian records?
ENID	You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
SEYMOUR	I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."

SEYMOUR	Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
ENID	Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...

SEYMOUR	There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
ENID	Sure, I guess.
SEYMOUR	Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.

ENID	Is this one any good?
SEYMOUR	Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.

SEYMOUR	This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
ENID	Wow!

ENID	How much is it?
SEYMOUR	A dollar seventy-five.
ENID	Okay.

ENID	Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
SEYMOUR	So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
ENID	Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
SEYMOUR	The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
ENID	Wow!
SEYMOUR	Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
ENID	Yeah, sure, I guess...
SEYMOUR	Watch my stuff.

ENID	Oops! I dropped it!
SEYMOUR	NO!!!
ENID	Hey, I was only kidding!

ENID	What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
SEYMOUR	I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
ENID	You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
SEYMOUR	Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
ENID	Really? Can I see it?
SEYMOUR	Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...

ENID	Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
SEYMOUR	I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
ENID	God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
SEYMOUR	Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
ENID	Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
SEYMOUR	You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.

ENID	No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
SEYMOUR	Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
ENID	I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
SEYMOUR	Oh, right...
ENID	No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
SEYMOUR	Good luck...
ENID	I'm totally serious!
SEYMOUR	Yeah, well...
ENID	I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
SEYMOUR	I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
ENID	Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
SEYMOUR	Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --

ENID	What about her? Would you go out with her?
SEYMOUR	I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
ENID	But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
SEYMOUR	I really didn't get a good look at her.

ENID	Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
SEYMOUR	Jesus!
ENID	C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
SEYMOUR	I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
ENID	Every guy has a type!
SEYMOUR	I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...

ENID	We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
SEYMOUR	Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
ENID	Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
SEYMOUR	Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
ENID	Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...

SEYMOUR	So is that your boyfriend?
ENID	Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
SEYMOUR	Well are --
ENID	Oh my god! We have to go in here!

SEYMOUR	Yeah, sure... very funny....
ENID	Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
SEYMOUR	I - I'd really rather not...
ENID	We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
SEYMOUR	I don't think so...
ENID	PLEASE? We have to!
SEYMOUR	I really don't think it's a good idea.
ENID	Fine, I'll go by myself then...

ENID	Wow! Look at all these creeps!
SEYMOUR	Shh!
ENID	OH MY GOD!

ENID	Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
SEYMOUR	These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.

SEYMOUR	Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
ENID	C'mon, Seymour, please?

ENID	Relax, Seymour, relax...
SEYMOUR	That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...

ENID	So, why did you bring this along?
SEYMOUR	I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
ENID	This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
SEYMOUR	I'm not holding my breath in that department.

SEYMOUR	What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
ENID	Jesus, Seymour.

SEYMOUR	Yes, that would certainly do...
ENID	Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
SEYMOUR	Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
ENID	Just wait here.

SEYMOUR	What did you tell that girl?
ENID	I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
SEYMOUR	Jesus...
SEYMOUR	Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
ENID	We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
SEYMOUR	Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
ENID	It's not hopeless...
SEYMOUR	Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
ENID	Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
SEYMOUR	But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
ENID	I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
SEYMOUR	Hooray for me.

SEYMOUR	I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
ENID	It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
SEYMOUR	Yet.

ENID	Wow, this is so cool...
SEYMOUR	If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
ENID	I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...

ENID	What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
SEYMOUR	What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
ENID	What, are you a klansman or something?
SEYMOUR	Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
ENID	Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS!
SEYMOUR	Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.

SEYMOUR	Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
ENID	You work at Cook's Chicken?
SEYMOUR	For nineteen years...
ENID	What are you, a fry cook or something?
SEYMOUR	Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
ENID	Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
SEYMOUR	Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
ENID	Yeah, but still...
SEYMOUR	I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?

ENID	So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
SEYMOUR	No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
ENID	Hey, can I borrow this?
SEYMOUR	What? Why?
ENID	I promise I'll take good care of it.
SEYMOUR	I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
ENID	Don't you trust me, Seymour?

ENID	You can open your eyes now.
SEYMOUR	Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
ENID	No, Doofus... blow it out!

SEYMOUR	Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
ENID	Are you okay?
SEYMOUR	It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...

ENID	What is that?
SEYMOUR	Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
ENID	What, like a girdle?
SEYMOUR	Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
ENID	Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
SEYMOUR	That's the spirit!
ENID	I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
SEYMOUR	Really?
ENID	Never...
SEYMOUR	I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
ENID	I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
SEYMOUR	Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
ENID	Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
SEYMOUR	Oh yeah?
ENID	Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
SEYMOUR	Why?
ENID	Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
SEYMOUR	I won't even dignify that with a response.

ENID	I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
SEYMOUR	Who knows?

ENID	Aren't you going to get that?
SEYMOUR	Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...

ENID	Wow!  What was that all about?
SEYMOUR	It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
ENID	That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
SEYMOUR	Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
ENID	Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
SEYMOUR	How can you be so sure?
ENID	Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!

SEYMOUR	Uh... hello?
ENID	Hi, it's me...
SEYMOUR	Oh, hi...
ENID	So, what happened?
SEYMOUR	Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
ENID	What? You're kidding me...
SEYMOUR	Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
ENID	What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
SEYMOUR	Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!

ENID	Boo!
SEYMOUR	YAAA!

ENID	Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
SEYMOUR	Really?
ENID	No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
SEYMOUR	I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
ENID	Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
SEYMOUR	Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
ENID	So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
SEYMOUR	Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
ENID	Sounds good...

SEYMOUR	We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
ENID	What, are you trying to get rid of me?
SEYMOUR	No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
ENID	Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
SEYMOUR	I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
ENID	I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
SEYMOUR	...so... is he your boyfriend now?
ENID	Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...

ENID	I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
SEYMOUR	I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
ENID	Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
SEYMOUR	...I better not...
ENID	Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
SEYMOUR	I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
ENID	Well when can we do something?
SEYMOUR	It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...

SEYMOUR	Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
ENID	And you like them?
SEYMOUR	Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
ENID	So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
SEYMOUR	No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
ENID	What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
SEYMOUR	No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
ENID	What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
SEYMOUR	Just someone so young...
ENID	You must have done something to make her think you like me.
SEYMOUR	I... I don't think so.
ENID	Does that mean you don't like me?
SEYMOUR	No, of course not.
ENID	So, do you like me, Seymour?
SEYMOUR	In what way do you mean?
ENID	In whatever way you think I mean.
SEYMOUR	I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
ENID	I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
SEYMOUR	...What do you mean?
ENID	Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.

SEYMOUR	What are you doing here?
ENID	I had to see you.
SEYMOUR	What's up?
ENID	Can you at least let me in?
SEYMOUR	Uh... sure... come in.
ENID	Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
SEYMOUR	What's the matter?
ENID	Do you have anything to drink?

SEYMOUR	Uh... I think there's some root beer...
ENID	What about this?

SEYMOUR	That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
ENID	FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.

ENID	You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
SEYMOUR	I could never move - I've got too much stuff.

ENID	Where did you get this?
SEYMOUR	Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
ENID	Jesus, how can you stand her?

SEYMOUR	God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
ENID	That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
SEYMOUR	If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
ENID	What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
SEYMOUR	I'm just being realistic.
ENID	At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
SEYMOUR	I hate sports.
ENID	How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
SEYMOUR	You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
ENID	Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
SEYMOUR	I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
ENID	I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
SEYMOUR	Yeah, sure. Of course.
ENID	...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
SEYMOUR	What about Joe?
ENID	Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
SEYMOUR	Yeah, well I like you too...

ENID	You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
SEYMOUR	What?
ENID	I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
SEYMOUR	I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
ENID	It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
SEYMOUR	Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
ENID	You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
SEYMOUR	I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
ENID	I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
SEYMOUR	So where would we go?
ENID	Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
SEYMOUR	I dunno, I...
ENID	I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
SEYMOUR	What do you want?
ENID	What do you want?
SEYMOUR	I-I-I...
ENID	What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!

ENID	God, Dana's going to kill you!
SEYMOUR	...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
ENID	What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
SEYMOUR	I will if you want to.
ENID	No... forget it...
SEYMOUR	I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
ENID	Yeah, well... me neither...
SEYMOUR	You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
ENID	I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
SEYMOUR	But, I...
ENID	Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.

SEYMOUR	I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
ENID	I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!

GERROLD	So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
JOE	They're Seymour's.
GERROLD	Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
JOE	Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
GERROLD	Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
JOE	Right.

JOE	Well, here's where the fun never stops!
SEYMOUR	Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
JOE	Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?

SEYMOUR	Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
JOE	Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.

JOE	Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
SEYMOUR	Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
JOE	No problem.

REBECCA	Please Josh?
JOSH	Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.

REBECCA	So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
JOSH	He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!

JOSH	I agree.
REBECCA	I wish I could see him.

REBECCA	Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
JOSH	Yeah.
REBECCA	Call me sometime.

ROBERTA	I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
MARGARET	I am.
ROBERTA	Talk to us about it...
MARGARET	It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
ROBERTA	Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.

ROBERTA	What do we have here, Margaret?
MARGARET	It's a tampon in a teacup...

ROBERTA	I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
MARGARET	It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
ROBERTA	Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
MARGARET	I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
ROBERTA	This shocking image of repressed femininity!
MARGARET	Right, exactly!
ROBERTA	I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!

SEYMOUR	Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
REBECCA	She's not at home?
SEYMOUR	No... they said she was here...
REBECCA	What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
SEYMOUR	Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
REBECCA	Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
SEYMOUR	Why would she be hiding from me?
REBECCA	I don't know... where is she, then?
SEYMOUR	Maybe she's with Josh?
REBECCA	Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
SEYMOUR	I don't know.
REBECCA	Why? What did she tell you?
SEYMOUR	She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
REBECCA	What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
SEYMOUR	I have no idea - I just want to...
REBECCA	Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
SEYMOUR	Really, I don't know enough about it to...
REBECCA	That slut!
SEYMOUR	Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
REBECCA	Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
SEYMOUR	Did she say that?
REBECCA	Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
SEYMOUR	What do you mean?
REBECCA	On that pathetic fake blind date.
SEYMOUR	What are you talking about?
REBECCA	Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
SEYMOUR	What fake blind date? What are you talking about?

SEYMOUR	I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
THERAPIST	So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
SEYMOUR	Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
THERAPIST	Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
SEYMOUR	It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
THERAPIST	Why don't we start with that next week?

SEYMOUR	Thank you, doctor.
THERAPIST	Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.

THERAPIST	Seymour?
SEYMOUR	Yes?
THERAPIST	Do you have a check for me?

ELAINE	Hello.
BEN	Hello.

ELAINE	You're living at home now. Is that right?
BEN	Yes.
ELAINE	Do you know what you're going to do?
BEN	No.
ELAINE	Are you going to graduate school?
BEN	No.

ELAINE	Do you always drive like this?
BEN	Yes.

BEN	Do you want some dinner?
ELAINE	I'd love some.

ELAINE	Aren't you eating?
BEN	No.
ELAINE	Why not?
BEN	If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.

ELAINE	Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
BEN	No -- why should I?
ELAINE	I don't know.

BEN	Could you do it?
ELAINE	No.

ELAINE	Will you take me home now?
BEN	I'm sorry I took you in there.
ELAINE	I think I'd better go home now please.
BEN	But, Elaine --
ELAINE	Where is the car?
BEN	I just want to tell you something.

ELAINE	I want to go home.
BEN	But could I just tell you this one thing?
ELAINE	What?
BEN	This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
ELAINE	Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
BEN	No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.

BEN	Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
ELAINE	No, I couldn't.
BEN	But could you try?
ELAINE	No.

BEN	I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
ELAINE	Yes, I do.

ELAINE	Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
BEN	No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
ELAINE	We won't. Let's go inside.
BEN	Wait a minute.
ELAINE	Is anything wrong?
BEN	No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
ELAINE	All right.

ELAINE	Where we going?
BEN	I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
ELAINE	Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?

ELAINE	What is the matter?
BEN	Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.

BEN	Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
ELAINE	Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.

ELAINE	Benjamin --
BEN	Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
ELAINE	Benjamin -- do they know you?
BEN	Of course not.

ELAINE	Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
BEN	I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.

BEN	Do you?
ELAINE	Yes.
BEN	You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.

ELAINE	I'm sorry. That is not my business.
BEN	It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?

ELAINE	Was she married or something?
BEN	Yes.
ELAINE	With a family?
BEN	Yes. She had a husband and a son.
ELAINE	Did they ever find out?
BEN	No.
ELAINE	And it's all over now.
BEN	Yes.
ELAINE	I'm glad.

ELAINE	All right.
BEN	During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
ELAINE	Okay.
BEN	You sure you really want to?
ELAINE	Yes.
BEN	Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
ELAINE	I do.
BEN	You do?
ELAINE	Benjamin -- I really do.

ELAINE	What's the matter?
BEN	You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
ELAINE	Benjamin -- what's happening?
BEN	Hurry up. Put your shoes on.

BEN	Why aren't you ready?
ELAINE	Because I want to know what's happening.

ELAINE	What is it?
BEN	That woman --
ELAINE	What?
BEN	That woman. The older woman.
ELAINE	You mean the one who --
BEN	Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --

BEN	Elaine --
ELAINE	Oh my God --

BEN	No -- don't cry --
ELAINE	GET OUT!
BEN	Don't cry. 
ELAINE	Get out of here.

ELAINE	I'm meeting someone.
BEN	Ah. Where?

BEN	Where are you meeting this person?
ELAINE	At the Zoo.
BEN	The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
ELAINE	I've never been to it.
BEN	Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.

BEN	Is that him over there?
ELAINE	No.
BEN	Where did he say he was going to meet you?
ELAINE	I thought he said by the monkey house.
BEN	Oh.

ELAINE	Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
BEN	Here? In Berkeley?
ELAINE	Yes.
BEN	Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
ELAINE	But you're not enrolled.
BEN	No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.

ELAINE	Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
BEN	Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
ELAINE	-- really incredible --
BEN	Here he comes.
ELAINE	What?
BEN	I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.

ELAINE	I want to ask you a question.
BEN	Come in.
ELAINE	No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
BEN	Because -- I am.
ELAINE	Is it because I'm here?
BEN	What do you think?
ELAINE	I think it is.

ELAINE	I said I think it is.
BEN	All right then! Yes!
ELAINE	Well, I want you to leave.
BEN	Elaine -- I love you.
ELAINE	How could you do that, Benjamin?

ELAINE	Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
BEN	What?
ELAINE	I don't understand --
BEN	Did you say rape her?
ELAINE	-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
BEN	What did she say?
ELAINE	Let me go.
BEN	You've got to tell me what she said.

ELAINE	Why?
BEN	Because it isn't true.
ELAINE	I don't feel well.

ELAINE	She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
BEN	Then what?
ELAINE	Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
BEN	Elaine -- that is not what happened.

ELAINE	Please let me go.
BEN	All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --

ELAINE	Don't tell me --
BEN	-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
ELAINE	Benjamin -- this is my mother!
BEN	-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --

ELAINE	Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
BEN	Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.

ELAINE	Can I just sit here while you're packing?
BEN	If you want.

ELAINE	What are you looking for?
BEN	My belt.
ELAINE	Don't you have it on?
BEN	No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
ELAINE	The marble?
BEN	The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
ELAINE	Oh.

ELAINE	What are you going to do now?
BEN	I don't know.

ELAINE	Are you going home?
BEN	No.
ELAINE	Well -- where are you going?

ELAINE	I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
BEN	I don't understand.
ELAINE	I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
BEN	But Elaine --
ELAINE	Goodbye.

ELAINE	Benjamin?
BEN	What?
ELAINE	Will you kiss me!

BEN	You won't?
ELAINE	I don't know.
BEN	But you might.
ELAINE	I might.
BEN	Is that so? You might marry me?
ELAINE	Yes.
BEN	When?
ELAINE	I don't know.
BEN	How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
ELAINE	I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
BEN	You mean you're confused?

BEN	Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
ELAINE	I don't see how we can.
BEN	We just can.
ELAINE	I have to go back now.

BEN	Elaine -- are you serious about this?
ELAINE	I'll think about it.
BEN	You really will?
ELAINE	Yes.

BEN	We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
ELAINE	Tomorrow?
BEN	Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
ELAINE	Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
BEN	We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?

ELAINE	I just don't think it would work.
BEN	Why wouldn't it?

BEN	Why wouldn't it?
ELAINE	I just don't think it would...

ELAINE	Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
BEN	Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
ELAINE	Well -- I have to see Carl first.
BEN	Carl who?

BEN	Carl who?
ELAINE	Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
BEN	Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
ELAINE	Yes.
BEN	Why do you have to see him?
ELAINE	Well -- I said I might marry him.

BEN	How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
ELAINE	No, Benjamin.
BEN	Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
ELAINE	He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
BEN	Oh no. He said that.
ELAINE	Shhhh.
BEN	Where did he do it?

BEN	Are we getting married tomorrow?
ELAINE	No.
BEN	The day after tomorrow?
ELAINE	Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.

ELAINE	Benjamin?
BEN	What?

WOMAN'S VOICE	657-2036
BEN	Hello -- who is this?
WOMAN'S VOICE	This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
BEN	Is the doctor anywhere?
WOMAN'S VOICE	Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
BEN	Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?

WOMAN'S VOICE	Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
BEN	Thank you.
WOMAN'S VOICE	I certainly hope you --

MR. MCQUIRE	Ben!
BEN	Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
MR. MCQUIRE	Ben.
BEN	Mr. McQuire.

MR. MCQUIRE	Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
BEN	Yes, sir.
MR. MCQUIRE	Are you listening?
BEN	Yes I am.
MR. MCQUIRE	Plastics.

BEN	Exactly how do you mean?
MR. MCQUIRE	There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
BEN	Yes, I will.
MR. MCQUIRE	Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.

MR. MCCLEERY	You a student?
BEN	Not exactly.

MR. MCCLEERY	What's that?
BEN	I said -- not exactly -- no.
MR. MCCLEERY	What are you then?
BEN	Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.

MR. MCCLEERY	I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
BEN	Ahhh.

MR. MCCLEERY	You're not one of those agitators?
BEN	What?
MR. MCCLEERY	One of those outside agitators.
BEN	Oh -- no sir.
MR. MCCLEERY	I hate that. I won't stand for it.

BEN	Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
MR. MCCLEERY	Who screamed?
BEN	It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
MR. MCCLEERY	Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
BEN	It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.

MR. MCCLEERY	What did you do to her?
BEN	Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.

BEN	See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
MR. MCCLEERY	All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
BEN	No, sir.

BEN	Mr. McCleery?
MR. MCCLEERY	You heard me. Out of here.
BEN	What for?
MR. MCCLEERY	Because I don't like you.

BEN	Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
MR. MCCLEERY	I want you out of here.
BEN	Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
MR. MCCLEERY	I am going to call the police now.
BEN	Could I make one phone call first?
MR. MCCLEERY	Get out!

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	BENJAMIN?
BEN	Yes.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Will you bring up my purse before you go?
BEN	I have to go now. I'm sorry.

BEN	Mrs. Robinson?
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	I'm in the bathroom.
BEN	Well here's the purse.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Could you bring it up?
BEN	Well I'll hand it to you.

BEN	Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.

BEN	I'm putting it on the top step.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?

BEN	I'm putting it here by the door.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Will you bring it in to me?
BEN	I'd rather not.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	All right. Put it in the room where we were.
BEN	Right.

MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Hello.
BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Benjamin?
BEN	Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Where are you?
BEN	-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Where are you?
BEN	Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Did you get a room?
BEN	No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	Give me an hour.
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE	I'll be there in an hour.

ROOM CLERK	Can I help you, sir!
BEN	What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --

BEN	What?
ROOM CLERK	The Singleman party, sir?
BEN	Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
ROOM CLERK	It's in the main ballroom.
BEN	Ahh -- thank you.

ROOM CLERK	Yes sir?
BEN	A room. I'd like a room, please.
ROOM CLERK	A single room or a double room?
BEN	A single. Just for myself, please.
ROOM CLERK	Will you sign the register, please?

ROOM CLERK	Is anything wrong, sir?
BEN	What? No. Nothing.
ROOM CLERK	Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
BEN	Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
ROOM CLERK	Where is it?
BEN	What?
ROOM CLERK	Where is your luggage?
BEN	Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
ROOM CLERK	Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
BEN	Oh no.
ROOM CLERK	Sir?
BEN	I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
ROOM CLERK	Of course.

ROOM CLERK	I'll have a porter show you the room.
BEN	Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
ROOM CLERK	Whatever you say, sir.

MRS. ROBINSON	Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
BEN	It's down the hall.

MRS. ROBINSON	How are you, Benjamin?
BEN	Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.

MRS. ROBINSON	Is there an ashtray in here?
BEN	No.
MRS. ROBINSON	Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.

MRS. ROBINSON	Is it a girl?
BEN	Is what a girl?
MRS. ROBINSON	Whatever it is you're upset about.
BEN	Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
MRS. ROBINSON	In general.
BEN	That's right.

MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	Will you take me home?
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?

BEN	You don't?
MRS. ROBINSON	No. 
BEN	Let's go.

MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
BEN	Right.

MRS. ROBINSON	Will you come in, please?
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
BEN	What for?
MRS. ROBINSON	Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.

MRS. ROBINSON	Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
BEN	But it's light in there now.
MRS. ROBINSON	Please.

MRS. ROBINSON	What do you drink? Bourbon?
BEN	Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?

BEN	All right then.
MRS. ROBINSON	What do you drink?

MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
BEN	Why not?
MRS. ROBINSON	Please wait till my husband gets home.
BEN	When is he coming back?
MRS. ROBINSON	I don't know.

MRS. ROBINSON	Drink?
BEN	No.

BEN	Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
BEN	Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
MRS. ROBINSON	I'm very neurotic.

MRS. ROBINSON	What do you think of me?
BEN	What do you mean?
MRS. ROBINSON	You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
BEN	Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
MRS. ROBINSON	Did you know I was an alcoholic?
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	Did you know that?
BEN	Look -- I think I should be going --
MRS. ROBINSON	Sit down, Benjamin.
BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
MRS. ROBINSON	No.
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	My husband will be back quite late.

BEN	Oh my God.
MRS. ROBINSON	Pardon?
BEN	Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
MRS. ROBINSON	What's wrong?
BEN	Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
MRS. ROBINSON	What?
BEN	I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
MRS. ROBINSON	Like what?
BEN	What do you think?
MRS. ROBINSON	Well I don't know.
BEN	For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
MRS. ROBINSON	So?
BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.

BEN	Aren't you?
MRS. ROBINSON	Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
BEN	Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
MRS. ROBINSON	It's all right.
BEN	It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
MRS. ROBINSON	Sit down.
BEN	Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
MRS. ROBINSON	All right. Now finish your drink.
BEN	Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
MRS. ROBINSON	We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
BEN	What is wrong with me?
MRS. ROBINSON	Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
BEN	Her portrait?
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
BEN	No.
MRS. ROBINSON	We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
BEN	Very much.

BEN	I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin?
BEN	Yes?
MRS. ROBINSON	Will you unzip my dress?

MRS. ROBINSON	I think I'll go to bed.
BEN	Oh. Well, goodnight.
MRS. ROBINSON	Won't you unzip my dress?
BEN	I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON	If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
BEN	No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
BEN	I know that. But I'm --
MRS. ROBINSON	Come on.

MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
BEN	Right.

MRS. ROBINSON	What are you so scared of?
BEN	I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON	Then why do you keep running away?
BEN	Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.

MRS. ROBINSON	Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
BEN	Yes, I have --

BEN	But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
MRS. ROBINSON	What if he did?
BEN	Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
MRS. ROBINSON	Don't you think he trusts us together?
BEN	Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
MRS. ROBINSON	I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
BEN	But they would! Don't you see?
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
BEN	I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
MRS. ROBINSON	Why is it?
BEN	Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
MRS. ROBINSON	Would you like me to seduce you?
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	Is that what you're trying to tell me?
BEN	I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.

MRS. ROBINSON	I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
BEN	Where is it?
MRS. ROBINSON	On that chair in the hall.

MRS. ROBINSON	Don't be nervous.
BEN	Get away from that door.
MRS. ROBINSON	I want to say something first.
BEN	Jesus Christ!
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
BEN	Oh my God.
MRS. ROBINSON	If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
BEN	Let me out!
MRS. ROBINSON	Do you understand what I said?
BEN	Yes. Yes. Let me out!
MRS. ROBINSON	Because I find you very attractive and any time --

MRS. ROBINSON	Yes, I do.
BEN	I've got to go.

MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin?
BEN	Yes.
MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you for taking me home.

MRS. ROBINSON	Hello, Benjamin.
BEN	Oh. Hello. Hello.

MRS. ROBINSON	May I sit down?
BEN	Of course.

MRS. ROBINSON	How are you?
BEN	Very well. Thank you.

MRS. ROBINSON	May I have a drink?
BEN	A drink? Of course.

BEN	He didn't see me.
MRS. ROBINSON	Waiter!

MRS. ROBINSON	You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
BEN	Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --

MRS. ROBINSON	Did you get us a room?
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	Have you gotten us a room yet?
BEN	I haven't. No.
MRS. ROBINSON	Do you want to?
BEN	Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
MRS. ROBINSON	Do you want me to get it?
BEN	You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
MRS. ROBINSON	Do you want to get it now?
BEN	Now?
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
BEN	Well -- I don't know.
MRS. ROBINSON	Why don't you get it.
BEN	Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.

BEN	I got a single room.
MRS. ROBINSON	That's fine.
BEN	But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
MRS. ROBINSON	Well -- do you want to go up first?
BEN	Yes -- I think that would be good.
MRS. ROBINSON	I'll be up in five minutes.
BEN	Well -- goodbye then --
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin.
BEN	Yes?
MRS. ROBINSON	Isn't there something you want to tell me?
BEN	To tell you?
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
BEN	Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
MRS. ROBINSON	The number.
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
BEN	Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
BEN	You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.

BEN	Well.
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin.
BEN	Yes?
MRS. ROBINSON	I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
BEN	Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
MRS. ROBINSON	Why don't you watch?
BEN	Oh -- sure. Thank you.

MRS. ROBINSON	Will you bring me a hanger?
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	A hanger.

BEN	Oh -- yes. Wood?
MRS. ROBINSON	What?
BEN	Wood or wire? They have both.
MRS. ROBINSON	Either one will be fine.
BEN	Okay.

MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
BEN	You're welcome.

MRS. ROBINSON	Would this be easier for you in the dark?
BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
MRS. ROBINSON	You what?
BEN	This is all terribly wrong.
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
BEN	Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
MRS. ROBINSON	Are you afraid of me?
BEN	No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, is this your first time?
BEN	Is this -- what?
MRS. ROBINSON	It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
BEN	That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
MRS. ROBINSON	You can admit that, can't you?
BEN	Are you kidding?
MRS. ROBINSON	It's nothing to be ashamed of --
BEN	Wait a minute!
MRS. ROBINSON	On your first time --
BEN	Who said it was my first time?
MRS. ROBINSON	That you're afraid --
BEN	Wait a minute.
MRS. ROBINSON	-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
BEN	INADEQUATE!

BEN	Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
MRS. ROBINSON	If you want.
BEN	Good. I mean are we dead or something?
MRS. ROBINSON	Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
BEN	All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
MRS. ROBINSON	Are you tired of it?
BEN	I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
MRS. ROBINSON	Well what do you want to talk about?
BEN	Anything. Anything at all.
MRS. ROBINSON	Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
BEN	Oh my God.
MRS. ROBINSON	Well?
BEN	Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --

BEN	Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
MRS. ROBINSON	How about art.
BEN	Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
MRS. ROBINSON	You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
BEN	Oh.
MRS. ROBINSON	Don't you?
BEN	Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
MRS. ROBINSON	Go ahead then.
BEN	Art. Well what do you want to know about it.

BEN	Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
MRS. ROBINSON	Neither.
BEN	You're not interested in art?
MRS. ROBINSON	No.
BEN	Then why do you want to talk about it?
MRS. ROBINSON	I don't.

MRS. ROBINSON	Can I take off my clothes now?
BEN	No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
MRS. ROBINSON	Do you really want me to?
BEN	Yes I do.
MRS. ROBINSON	I got up.

MRS. ROBINSON	Do you want to hear it or not?
BEN	Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
MRS. ROBINSON	I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
BEN	What one.
MRS. ROBINSON	What?
BEN	What novel did you read.
MRS. ROBINSON	I don't remember.

MRS. ROBINSON	Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
BEN	There!
MRS. ROBINSON	What?
BEN	Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
MRS. ROBINSON	Him?
BEN	I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
MRS. ROBINSON	There isn't any.
BEN	There's no risk?

BEN	How do you get out of the house?
MRS. ROBINSON	I walk out.
BEN	You walk right out the door.

BEN	What do you say to him?
MRS. ROBINSON	He's asleep.
BEN	Always?
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
BEN	Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
MRS. ROBINSON	Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
BEN	But what about the noise from the car. What if --
MRS. ROBINSON	The driveway's on my side of the house.
BEN	We're talking.
MRS. ROBINSON	What?
BEN	We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
MRS. ROBINSON	Calm down, Benjamin.
BEN	Now let's keep going here.
MRS. ROBINSON	Can I undress and talk at the same time?
BEN	Right.
MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
BEN	Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
MRS. ROBINSON	We don't.
BEN	So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
MRS. ROBINSON	No we don't.
BEN	Well how long has this been going on.
MRS. ROBINSON	About five years.
BEN	Oh no. Are you kidding me?
MRS. ROBINSON	No.
BEN	You have not slept with your husband for five years?
MRS. ROBINSON	Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
BEN	How many times a year.
MRS. ROBINSON	On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
BEN	Man, is this interesting.
MRS. ROBINSON	Is it?
BEN	So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
MRS. ROBINSON	We've talked enough, Benjamin.
BEN	Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
MRS. ROBINSON	Not exactly.
BEN	But you don't hate him.
MRS. ROBINSON	No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
BEN	Well how do you feel about him, then?
MRS. ROBINSON	I don't.
BEN	Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
MRS. ROBINSON	Is it?
BEN	I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.

BEN	Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
MRS. ROBINSON	No.
BEN	What?
MRS. ROBINSON	I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
BEN	Well, wait a minute. You married him.

BEN	Why did you do that?
MRS. ROBINSON	See if you can guess.
BEN	Well I can't.
MRS. ROBINSON	Think real hard, Benjamin.
BEN	I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
MRS. ROBINSON	Don't tell Elaine.
BEN	Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
MRS. ROBINSON	Are you shocked?
BEN	Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
MRS. ROBINSON	All right. Now let's get to bed.
BEN	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
MRS. ROBINSON	What?
BEN	I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
MRS. ROBINSON	Not particularly.
BEN	Was he a law student at the time?

BEN	And you were a student also.
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
BEN	At college.
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
BEN	What was your major?
MRS. ROBINSON	Why are you asking me all this?
BEN	Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
MRS. ROBINSON	Art.
BEN	Art?

BEN	But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
MRS. ROBINSON	Kind of.
BEN	Well how did it happen?
MRS. ROBINSON	How do you think.
BEN	I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
BEN	I'm curious.
MRS. ROBINSON	We'd go to his car.
BEN	Oh no. In the car you did it?
MRS. ROBINSON	I don't think we were the first.

BEN	What kind of car was it?
MRS. ROBINSON	What?
BEN	Do you remember the make of the car?
MRS. ROBINSON	Oh my God.
BEN	Really. I want to know.
MRS. ROBINSON	It was a Ford, Benjamin.
BEN	A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
MRS. ROBINSON	That's enough.
BEN	So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.

MRS. ROBINSON	Don't talk about Elaine.
BEN	Don't talk about Elaine?
MRS. ROBINSON	No.
BEN	Why not?
MRS. ROBINSON	Because I don't want you to.

BEN	I wish you'd tell me.
MRS. ROBINSON	There's nothing to tell.
BEN	Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?

BEN	Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.

MRS. ROBINSON	Do you understand that?
BEN	Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
MRS. ROBINSON	Good.
BEN	I was just kidding around.
MRS. ROBINSON	Good.
BEN	But why shouldn't I?
MRS. ROBINSON	I have my reasons.
BEN	Then let's hear them.
MRS. ROBINSON	No.
BEN	Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.

BEN	I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
MRS. ROBINSON	Let's drop it.
BEN	We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin?
BEN	I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes.
BEN	You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
MRS. ROBINSON	I wouldn't know.
BEN	Well, I'm not.
MRS. ROBINSON	You're not.
BEN	No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
MRS. ROBINSON	I see.
BEN	And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.

BEN	Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
MRS. ROBINSON	Are you?
BEN	You're goddamn right I am.

MRS. ROBINSON	That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
BEN	Now don't start this.
MRS. ROBINSON	What?
BEN	Don't start acting hurt.
MRS. ROBINSON	Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
BEN	Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
MRS. ROBINSON	Did I say that?
BEN	Of course you did.

MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
BEN	Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
MRS. ROBINSON	I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
BEN	You wouldn't.
MRS. ROBINSON	Of course I wouldn't.

BEN	What are you doing?
MRS. ROBINSON	Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
BEN	Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
MRS. ROBINSON	If that's how you feel --
BEN	But it's not.
MRS. ROBINSON	That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
BEN	Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
MRS. ROBINSON	But if it's sickening for you --
BEN	It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
MRS. ROBINSON	You don't have to say that.
BEN	Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
MRS. ROBINSON	May I stay then?
BEN	Yes. Please. I want you to.
MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.
BEN	Well don't thank me, because I want you to.

BEN	Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
MRS. ROBINSON	Then give me your word you won't.
BEN	This is absurd.
MRS. ROBINSON	Promise me, Benjamin.
BEN	All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON	Thank you.  Benjamin --
BEN	Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.

BEN	Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
BEN	Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
MRS. ROBINSON	But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.

MRS. ROBINSON	Drive down the block.
BEN	Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
MRS. ROBINSON	Do exactly what I say.

BEN	Now it seems to me --
MRS. ROBINSON	Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?

BEN	Mrs. Robinson --
MRS. ROBINSON	I can makes things quite unpleasant.
BEN	How?
MRS. ROBINSON	In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
BEN	I don't believe you.
MRS. ROBINSON	Then you'd better start believing me.
BEN	Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
MRS. ROBINSON	Go home now.
BEN	I just don't believe you would do that.

MRS. ROBINSON	Hello. Get me the police, please.
BEN	Where is Elaine?
MRS. ROBINSON	I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.

BEN	What have you done to her?
MRS. ROBINSON	I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?

BEN	You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
MRS. ROBINSON	I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
BEN	What the hell have you done?

MRS. ROBINSON	Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
BEN	I'll find her.
MRS. ROBINSON	I don't think so.

BEN	I say I've got it.
CLERK	Sir?
BEN	The toothbrush. I got it all right.
CLERK	Very good, sir.
BEN	Yes. Well -- goodnight.
CLERK	Goodnight, sir.

BEN	No -- actually I'm not --
MRS. SINGLEMAN	I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --

MRS. SINGLEMAN	Braddock -- Braddock?
BEN	Yes, but I'm afraid --
MRS. SINGLEMAN	I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
BEN	No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
MRS. SINGLEMAN	I'm afraid I don't understand.
BEN	I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
MRS. SINGLEMAN	Hey -- I don't get it.

MRS. BRADDOCK	Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
BEN	Hello, Mrs. Robinson.

MRS. BRADDOCK	Can I talk to you a minute?
BEN	Sure.
MRS. BRADDOCK	Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
BEN	What?
MRS. BRADDOCK	Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
BEN	When I go off?
MRS. BRADDOCK	You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
BEN	No, I do. I want to tell you.

BEN	I drive around.
MRS. BRADDOCK	What else?
BEN	Nothing else.
MRS. BRADDOCK	Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
BEN	Oh, no.
MRS. BRADDOCK	Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
BEN	Meet someone?

BEN	Why did you say that?
MRS. BRADDOCK	Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
BEN	No wait. Wait.

BEN	I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
MRS. BRADDOCK	Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
BEN	Well, wait.

BEN	Well why do you -- why do you think that?
MRS. BRADDOCK	Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
BEN	Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
MRS. BRADDOCK	Not if you don't want to.
BEN	I do.
MRS. BRADDOCK	But I don't want you to make up something.
BEN	I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
MRS. BRADDOCK	Goodnight, Benjamin.
BEN	You believe me, don't you?
MRS. BRADDOCK	No.
BEN	You don't?

BEN	But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
MRS. BRADDOCK	Goodnight.

MRS. BRADDOCK	It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
BEN	Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.

MRS. BRADDOCK	Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
BEN	I do.
MRS. BRADDOCK	-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.

BEN	I'm going up to Berkeley today.
MRS. BRADDOCK	Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --

MRS. BRADDOCK	They don't know?
BEN	No -- they don't.
MRS. BRADDOCK	Well -- when did you decide all this?
BEN	About an hour ago.

MRS. BRADDOCK	When did you two talk this over?
BEN	We haven't.

BEN	I'm just --
MR. BRADDOCK	-- worried?
BEN	Well --
MR. BRADDOCK	About what?
BEN	I guess -- about my future.
MR. BRADDOCK	What about it?
BEN	I don't know. I want it to be --
MR. BRADDOCK	To be what?
BEN	Different.

MR. BRADDOCK	Why?
BEN	Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
MR. BRADDOCK	Have you thought about graduate school?
BEN	No.
MR. BRADDOCK	Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
BEN	You got me.
MR. BRADDOCK	Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.

MR. BRADDOCK	I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
BEN	Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
MR. BRADDOCK	How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
BEN	That has nothing to do with it --
MR. BRADDOCK	I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --

MR. BRADDOCK	Say that again.
BEN	I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

MR. BRADDOCK	Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
BEN	No. I think you'll want to wait on that.

MR. BRADDOCK	Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
BEN	No. She doesn't know about it.
MR. BRADDOCK	She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
BEN	No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.

MR. BRADDOCK	Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
BEN	No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.

BEN	I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
MR. ROBINSON	Swell. I appreciate it.
BEN	She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
MR. ROBINSON	Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
BEN	Yes, sir.

MR. ROBINSON	Here. It looks like you need a refill.
BEN	Oh no.
MR. ROBINSON	What?
BEN	I've got to go.
MR. ROBINSON	Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
BEN	No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.

BEN	Thank you very much, sir.
MR. ROBINSON	Ben -- how old are you now?
BEN	Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
MR. ROBINSON	That's a hell of a good age to be.
BEN	Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON	I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
BEN	Sir?
MR. ROBINSON	You'll never be young again.
BEN	I know.
MR. ROBINSON	Ben, can I say something to you?
BEN	What?
MR. ROBINSON	How long have we known each other now?

MR. ROBINSON	How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
BEN	Quite a while.
MR. ROBINSON	I've watched you grow up, Ben.
BEN	Yes, sir.
MR. ROBINSON	In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
BEN	Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON	So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
BEN	I'd like to hear it.
MR. ROBINSON	Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.

MR. ROBINSON	You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
BEN	Oh no.
MR. ROBINSON	What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?

MR. ROBINSON	Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
BEN	Oh yes.
MR. ROBINSON	Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
BEN	I will.
MR. ROBINSON	Great.

MR. ROBINSON	Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
BEN	Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
MR. ROBINSON	That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
BEN	I will.
MR. ROBINSON	Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.

BEN	Hello.
MR. ROBINSON	What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
BEN	Yes.

MR. ROBINSON	Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
BEN	Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON	Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
BEN	No, it's not --
MR. ROBINSON	Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
BEN	It was nothing to do with you, sir.
MR. ROBINSON	Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.

BEN	Now look -- please --
MR. ROBINSON	Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
BEN	I am not threatening you.
MR. ROBINSON	Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
BEN	I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
MR. ROBINSON	You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
BEN	No, I don't.
MR. ROBINSON	Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
BEN	But why?
MR. ROBINSON	Why?
BEN	It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
MR. ROBINSON	That's quite a statement.
BEN	Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
MR. ROBINSON	Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
BEN	You miss the point.
MR. ROBINSON	Don't shout at me, Ben.
BEN	The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
MR. ROBINSON	Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
BEN	HUH?
MR. ROBINSON	I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...

MRS. ROBINSON	Hello.
BEN'S VOICE	Mrs. Robinson?
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes?
BEN'S VOICE	It's Benjamin.
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes?
BEN'S VOICE	Benjamin Braddock.
MRS. ROBINSON	Benjamin -- where are you?
BEN'S VOICE	Can you look through the glass.

BEN'S VOICE	Can you see me now?
MRS. ROBINSON	Yes, I can.

MR. BRADDOCK	Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
BEN'S VOICE	Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?

BEN'S VOICE	Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
MR. BRADDOCK	Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --

MR. BRADDOCK	I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
BEN'S VOICE	I'd like to discuss this.
MR. BRADDOCK	This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --

MR. BRADDOCK	-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
BEN'S VOICE	Dad -- can you listen --
MR. BRADDOCK	I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --

MRS. BRADDOCK	Is anything wrong?
MR. BRADDOCK	No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!

MRS. BRADDOCK	The Carlsons' are here.
MR. BRADDOCK	They are?  Come on.

MRS. BRADDOCK	They came all the way from Tarzana.
MR. BRADDOCK	It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.

MRS. BRADDOCK	What's happening?
MR. BRADDOCK	Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
MRS. BRADDOCK	I don't believe it.
MR. BRADDOCK	That what he says. Right?

CANDY	Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
MRS. CHASEN	How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.

MRS. CHASEN	You are at the University, Candy?
CANDY	Yes, I am.
MRS. CHASEN	And what are you studying?
CANDY	Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
MRS. CHASEN	Eh, Poli Sci?
CANDY	Political Science. It's all about what's going on.

CANDY	He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
MRS. CHASEN	Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?

MRS. CHASEN	I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
CANDY	Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.

COP	Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
MAUDE	Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
COP	Yes.
MAUDE	Oh, I don't have one.
COP	Come again.
MAUDE	I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
COP	How long have you been driving?
MAUDE	About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
COP	Could I see your registration?
MAUDE	I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
COP	Isn't this your vehicle?
MAUDE	No, no. I just took it.
COP	Took it?
MAUDE	Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
COP	Your tree.
MAUDE	Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
COP	Lady, let me get this straight.
MAUDE	All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.

COP	Okay, lady. Out.
MAUDE	Hello.

MAUDE	Haven't we met before?
COP	None of that, lady.
MAUDE	Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
COP	Out!

MAUDE	But there is a family resemblance.
COP	You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
MAUDE	We planted it.
COP	Is this your shovel?
MAUDE	No.
COP	Possession of a stolen shovel.
MAUDE	Officer, I can explain.
COP	Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
MAUDE	Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
COP	Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
MAUDE	Check.
COP	And that truck - is it registered in your name?
MAUDE	Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
COP	Then whose name is it registered in?
MAUDE	Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
COP	Where are the papers?
MAUDE	I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
COP	Wait here.
MAUDE	Because if you are...
COP	Lady! Be quiet.

MRS. CHASEN	This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
EDITH	What kind of a car is it?

EDITH	Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
MRS. CHASEN	Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
EDITH	Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.

MRS. CHASEN	And what do you do, my dear?
EDITH	I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
MRS. CHASEN	How interesting.
EDITH	Not very.
MRS. CHASEN	Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
EDITH	I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.

MRS. CHASEN	Edith was just telling me about her job.
EDITH	I'm a file clerk.
MRS. CHASEN	Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
EDITH	Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
MRS. CHASEN	She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
EDITH	Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...

GLAUCUS	What do you want?
HAROLD	I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.

HAROLD	Sorry I'm late.
GLAUCUS	A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
HAROLD	A block of ice.
GLAUCUS	Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
HAROLD	What do you see?
GLAUCUS	I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.

HAROLD	Here's your shovel.
GLAUCUS	What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.

HAROLD	Eh, no. Thank you.
MAUDE	You're welcome.  Did you know him?
HAROLD	Eh, no.
MAUDE	Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
HAROLD	I don't know.
MAUDE	I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.

MAUDE	It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
HAROLD	Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
MAUDE	Oh, of course. What is your name?
HAROLD	Harold Chasen.
MAUDE	How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
HAROLD	Nice to meet you.
MAUDE	Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?

MAUDE	Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
HAROLD	No, thank you. I have my car.
MAUDE	Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.

MAUDE	Do you dance?
HAROLD	What?
MAUDE	Do you sing and dance?
HAROLD	Eh, no.
MAUDE	No.  I thought not.

HAROLD	Yes.
MAUDE	Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
HAROLD	Yes.
MAUDE	Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
HAROLD	But this is my car.
MAUDE	Your hearse?
HAROLD	Yearse!
MAUDE	Oh.

MAUDE	Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
HAROLD	And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
MAUDE	Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
HAROLD	Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
MAUDE	What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
HAROLD	Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
MAUDE	Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...

MAUDE	It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
HAROLD	It's very interesting.
MAUDE	Oh, look! The birds.

MAUDE	She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
HAROLD	Thank you, but I really have to go.
MAUDE	But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
HAROLD	No.
MAUDE	Well then.

HAROLD	Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
MAUDE	Oh, at the dentist's?
HAROLD	Sort of.
MAUDE	Well, then, you must come back and visit.
HAROLD	All right.
MAUDE	My door is always open.
HAROLD	All right.
MAUDE	Promise?

MAUDE	Harold?
HAROLD	Maude???!

MAUDE	How about some ginger pie?
HAROLD	Eh, fine.
MAUDE	I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
HAROLD	Oh, it's fine. Fine.
MAUDE	She seemed yare to me.

HAROLD	Do you often model for Glaucus?
MAUDE	Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
HAROLD	Me! No. Of course not.
MAUDE	Really. Do you think it's wrong?
HAROLD	No. 
MAUDE	Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.

MAUDE	A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
HAROLD	Yes. Very much.
MAUDE	It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."

MAUDE	Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
HAROLD	Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
MAUDE	It goes on and on.
HAROLD	That's really great.

MAUDE	What do you think?
HAROLD	Oh. Eh, I like it.
MAUDE	No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.

MAUDE	Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
HAROLD	Certainly a new experience for me.
MAUDE	Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.

HAROLD	You look as if you could.
MAUDE	Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
HAROLD	You don't look eighty.
MAUDE	That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
HAROLD	That's a nice teapot.
MAUDE	Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?

MAUDE	Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
HAROLD	What do you mean?

MAUDE	I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
HAROLD	I don't know. Just one of those. 

MAUDE	Why do you say that?
HAROLD	Because they are all the same.
MAUDE	Oooh, but they are not. Look.

HAROLD	Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
MAUDE	Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.

MAUDE	The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
HAROLD	Well...

HAROLD	What happened?
MAUDE	Look.
HAROLD	What?
MAUDE	Over there by the courthouse.
HAROLD	What is it?
MAUDE	That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.

MAUDE	Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
HAROLD	But what?
MAUDE	We'll transplant it. To the forest.
HAROLD	But we can't just dig it up!
MAUDE	Why not?
HAROLD	But this is public property.
MAUDE	Exactly.

HAROLD	Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
MAUDE	Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
HAROLD	Oh, wait, Maude. Look!

MAUDE	Oh, my. We're too late.
HAROLD	Is he all right?
MAUDE	He's fallen asleep, as usual.

MAUDE	We'll come back in the morning.
HAROLD	What is that he's working on?
MAUDE	An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
HAROLD	It is kind of rough.
MAUDE	He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
HAROLD	Look, the ice is melting.
MAUDE	Yes.

MAUDE	A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
HAROLD	Well, I really don't drink...
MAUDE	Oh, it's all right. It's organic.

HAROLD	Thank you.
MAUDE	Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
HAROLD	Thank you.

HAROLD	What's that?
MAUDE	My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
HAROLD	What were you fighting for?
MAUDE	Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.

MAUDE	No.
HAROLD	No more revolts.
MAUDE	Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
HAROLD	Well, I don't...
MAUDE	Oh come on. I'll teach you.

MAUDE	Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
HAROLD	But I don't play anything.
MAUDE	Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.

HAROLD	Okay?
MAUDE	Superb.

HAROLD	I think he's following us.
MAUDE	Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.

HAROLD	He's stopped.
MAUDE	The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.

MAUDE	There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
HAROLD	I don't know.
MAUDE	I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.

MAUDE	Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
HAROLD	Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.

HAROLD	I <u>think</u> I see it.
MAUDE	Yes. It's almost there.

HAROLD	The ice is melting.
MAUDE	Yes.
HAROLD	Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
MAUDE	Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.

HAROLD	I like Glaucus.
MAUDE	Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
HAROLD	Well, I really don't smoke.
MAUDE	It's all right.  It's organic.
HAROLD	I'm sure picking up on vices.
MAUDE	Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
HAROLD	Did Confucius say that?
MAUDE	Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
HAROLD	You are the wisest person I know.
MAUDE	Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
HAROLD	Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
MAUDE	What was that?
HAROLD	Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
MAUDE	How ingenious! Tell me about them.
HAROLD	Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
MAUDE	Of course.
HAROLD	Okay.

MAUDE	Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
HAROLD	I like you, Maude.
MAUDE	I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.

HAROLD	Look at that sky.  It's so big.
MAUDE	It's so blue.
HAROLD	And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
MAUDE	Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
HAROLD	Maude, do you pray?
MAUDE	Pray? No.  I communicate. 
HAROLD	With God?
MAUDE	With Life.

HAROLD	This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
MAUDE	Well, why don't you?
HAROLD	No. I'd feel stupid.
MAUDE	Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.

HAROLD	Want to join me in some cartwheels?
MAUDE	No. I feel more like - yodeling.
HAROLD	Yodeling?

MAUDE	It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
HAROLD	Where's that?
MAUDE	From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
HAROLD	Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.

MAUDE	Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
HAROLD	Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
MAUDE	Oh.
HAROLD	I've never met her. My mother set it up.
MAUDE	Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...

HAROLD	Maude, I must speak to you.
MAUDE	What is it, Harold?
HAROLD	They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
MAUDE	But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
HAROLD	But they have.
MAUDE	Well, don't go.

HAROLD	But they'll put me in jail.
MAUDE	Really. Just put it there, Harold.

MAUDE	They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
HAROLD	Maude, do you think you can help me?
MAUDE	What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.

MAUDE	Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
HAROLD	Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?

MAUDE	Don't you advance on me.
HAROLD	... of you. You'll all end up like this.

HAROLD	Just like this.
MAUDE	Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
HAROLD	She took my head.

HAROLD	That wasn't very scary.
MAUDE	No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
HAROLD	Oh, you weren't scared.
MAUDE	Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
HAROLD	Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.

HAROLD	How about some candy floss?
MAUDE	Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.

HAROLD	You sure have a way with people.
MAUDE	Well, they're my species.

HAROLD	Look at the stars.
MAUDE	Yes. They're old friends.
HAROLD	Do you think there is any life up there?
MAUDE	I don't know. Perhaps.
HAROLD	Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
MAUDE	We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
HAROLD	You should have been a poet.
MAUDE	Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -

MAUDE	- end where I began.
HAROLD	Maude.
MAUDE	Yes.
HAROLD	Here.

HAROLD	Why are there no photographs in these frames?
MAUDE	I took them out.
HAROLD	Why?
MAUDE	They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
HAROLD	I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.

HAROLD	It looks like you. Thanks.
MAUDE	Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
HAROLD	You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.

MAUDE	I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
HAROLD	You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
MAUDE	Oh, Harold. You are so young.

HAROLD	Supper for two.
MAUDE	Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
HAROLD	It's all right. It's organic.
MAUDE	Oh, Harold. 
HAROLD	For you.

HAROLD	... which I hope will make you very happy.
MAUDE	Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
HAROLD	Farewell?
MAUDE	Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
HAROLD	But you're not going anywhere, are you?
MAUDE	Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.

MAUDE	Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
HAROLD	Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
MAUDE	But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
HAROLD	But why now?
MAUDE	I thought eighty was a good round number.

MAUDE	I feel giddy.
HAROLD	But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
MAUDE	Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
HAROLD	It's true. I can't live without you.
MAUDE	And this too shall pass away.
HAROLD	Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
MAUDE	Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.

MAUDE	Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
HAROLD	Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.

HAROLD	Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
MAUDE	Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.

MRS. CHASEN	Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
HAROLD	I have a sore throat.
MRS. CHASEN	Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...

HAROLD	Mother.
MRS. CHASEN	Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
HAROLD	Mother.
MRS. CHASEN	Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
HAROLD	Mother. I'm going to get married.
MRS. CHASEN	Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
HAROLD	I'm getting married.
MRS. CHASEN	To whom?
HAROLD	To a girl. Here.

MRS. CHASEN	I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
HAROLD	What?
MRS. CHASEN	A sunflower?

MRS. CHASEN	Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
HAROLD	At a funeral.
MRS. CHASEN	Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
HAROLD	I don't care what people say.
MRS. CHASEN	You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...

HAROLD	I'm going to marry the woman I love.
MRS. CHASEN	Harold!

MRS. CHASEN	This is insane.
HAROLD	Perhaps it is.

HAROLD	How do you do?
SUNSHINE	Can't complain.

HAROLD	Would you like a cigarette?
SUNSHINE	No, thank you. They stain my fingers.

HAROLD	Is Sunshine your real name?
SUNSHINE	Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.

SUNSHINE	Do you play?
HAROLD	No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
SUNSHINE	Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.

SUNSHINE	Oh, is this your father?
HAROLD	No. My uncle.
SUNSHINE	Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.

HAROLD	This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
SUNSHINE	Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
HAROLD	An ancient Japanese ceremony.
SUNSHINE	Like a tea ceremony?
HAROLD	No. Like this.

PSYCHIATRIST	Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
HAROLD	An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
PSYCHIATRIST	And why is that?
HAROLD	Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
PSYCHIATRIST	Just give me a rough estimate.
HAROLD	Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
PSYCHIATRIST	Fifteen.
HAROLD	A rough estimate.
PSYCHIATRIST	And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
HAROLD	I wouldn't say "benefit."
PSYCHIATRIST	No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?

HAROLD	I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
PSYCHIATRIST	Does that worry you?
HAROLD	Yes. It does.
PSYCHIATRIST	Why?
HAROLD	I put a lot of effort into these things.
PSYCHIATRIST	Ah, yes.
HAROLD	And a lot of time.
PSYCHIATRIST	I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
HAROLD	No.
PSYCHIATRIST	What about the draft?
HAROLD	My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
PSYCHIATRIST	Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
HAROLD	You mean when I'm not working on a...
PSYCHIATRIST	Yes. What kind of things do you do?

PSYCHIATRIST	I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
HAROLD	I don't know.
PSYCHIATRIST	Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
HAROLD	No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
PSYCHIATRIST	What else do you like?

PSYCHIATRIST	That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
HAROLD	I go to funerals.

PSYCHIATRIST	Harold?
HAROLD	Huh?
PSYCHIATRIST	You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
HAROLD	No.
PSYCHIATRIST	None at all?
HAROLD	Well, maybe one.
PSYCHIATRIST	Would you care to talk about this friend?
HAROLD	No.
PSYCHIATRIST	Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
HAROLD	No.
PSYCHIATRIST	I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
HAROLD	Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST	You liked your teachers?
HAROLD	Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST	Your classmates?
HAROLD	Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST	Your studies?
HAROLD	Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST	Then why did you leave?
HAROLD	I burnt down the Chemistry building.

PSYCHIATRIST	We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
HAROLD	Yes.
PSYCHIATRIST	Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?

PSYCHIATRIST	I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
HAROLD	No.  I'd have liked to.
PSYCHIATRIST	Why?
HAROLD	I'd have liked to talk to him.
PSYCHIATRIST	What would you say?
HAROLD	I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
PSYCHIATRIST	What kind of stuff?

UNCLE VICTOR	Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
HAROLD	Thank you, Uncle.
UNCLE VICTOR	Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
HAROLD	Yes, sir.
UNCLE VICTOR	Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.

UNCLE VICTOR	Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
HAROLD	During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
UNCLE VICTOR	Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
HAROLD	War is not all black.

UNCLE VICTOR	And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
HAROLD	Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.

UNCLE VICTOR	They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
HAROLD	Jeez! That's a great story,
UNCLE VICTOR	Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
HAROLD	You think so, sir?
UNCLE VICTOR	Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
HAROLD	I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
UNCLE VICTOR	It's the greatest excitement in the world.
HAROLD	To pit your own life against another.
UNCLE VICTOR	That's right.
HAROLD	To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
UNCLE VICTOR	The moment of truth.
HAROLD	Another man's life in your sights.
UNCLE VICTOR	Yes.
HAROLD	ZAT!

HAROLD	Will they really teach me to shoot?
UNCLE VICTOR	Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
HAROLD	And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
UNCLE VICTOR	Oh sure.
HAROLD	How about hand-to-hand combat?
UNCLE VICTOR	Yes.
HAROLD	To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
UNCLE VICTOR	Eh?
HAROLD	How about to slit his throat?
UNCLE VICTOR	Well, I don't...
HAROLD	I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
UNCLE VICTOR	Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
HAROLD	Sir, how about souvenirs?
UNCLE VICTOR	Souvenirs?
HAROLD	Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
UNCLE VICTOR	Harold!
HAROLD	What's the chance of getting one of these?

HAROLD	Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
UNCLE VICTOR	Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!

HAROLD	Parasite!
UNCLE VICTOR	Harold!
HAROLD	Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.

UNCLE VICTOR	Harold, calm down! This is...
HAROLD	She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...

UNCLE VICTOR	Stay where you are, Harold .
HAROLD	She took my head.

MAUDE	Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
OFFICER	Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
MAUDE	Well, it's a tricky turn.
OFFICER	Eh, yes, ma'm.
MAUDE	Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
OFFICER	Oh yes. That's fine.
MAUDE	Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.

PRIEST	Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
MAUDE	Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
PRIEST	Yes.
MAUDE	Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.

PRIEST	Were you also the one who painted the statues?
MAUDE	Oh, yes. How did you like that?
PRIEST	Well, I didn't.
MAUDE	Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
PRIEST	But wait...

ROB	Do I know you?
ALISON'S MOM	I don't know.

ROB	Alison's.
ALISON'S MOM	Really.
ROB	Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.

ROB	Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
ALISON'S MOM	I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
ROB	You gotta be kidding me.
ALISON'S MOM	That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.

ROB	Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
ALISON'S MOM	I beg your pardon?
ROB	Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.

ROB	TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
BARRY	IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.

BARRY	What are you doing?
ROB	I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
BARRY	Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
ROB	I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
BARRY	But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
ROB	Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
BARRY	Don't you want to hear what's next?
ROB	What's next?
BARRY	Play it.
ROB	Say it.
BARRY	Little Latin Lupe Lu.

ROB	How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
BARRY	Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
ROB	Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
BARRY	Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
ROB	We'll do it next Monday.
BARRY	Well what's the point in that?

ROB	Nice, Barry.
BARRY	Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
ROB	You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
BARRY	We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
ROB	Not the point.
BARRY	Oh, so what's the point then?
ROB	I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
BARRY	Our customers? You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?

ROB	Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
BARRY	Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
ROB	What did he ever do to you?
BARRY	He offended me with his terrible taste.
ROB	It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
BARRY	Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?

BARRY	Yeah.
ROB	But now I kind of like it.

BARRY	I wanna date a musician...
ROB	I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
BARRY	...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...

ROB	What did you tell her about the shop for?
BARRY	I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.

BARRY	We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
ROB	That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
BARRY	We can take your car.
ROB	It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.

BARRY	What?
ROB	What do you mean, "what?"
BARRY	What are you snickering about?
ROB	I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
BARRY	What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?

ROB	Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
BARRY	Ehh.
ROB	Thunder Road, Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
BARRY	Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
ROB	Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
BARRY	Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?

ROB	There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
BARRY	-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
ROB	-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?

ROB	Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
BARRY	To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
ROB	Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?

BARRY	I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
ROB	No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
BARRY	I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
ROB	Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
BARRY	-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, yeah, yeah, I hear you --
ROB	Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
BARRY	Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...

BARRY	...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
ROB	But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
BARRY	How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.

ROB	Why would they care?
BARRY	Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.

BARRY	I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
ROB	Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.

BARRY	Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
ROB	Ha.

BARRY	Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
ROB	How do you know about that?
BARRY	Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?

ROB	Shut the fuck up, Barry.
BARRY	Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.

ROB	Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
BARRY	Suck my ass.
ROB	Terrific.

BARRY	Hey.
ROB	What the fuck is that?
BARRY	My band.
ROB	What band?
BARRY	The band that found me and asked me to join.
ROB	You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
BARRY	Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
ROB	Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
BARRY	I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
ROB	You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
BARRY	They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
ROB	That's why you got the gig, isn't it?

ROB	Isn't it?
BARRY	That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
ROB	Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
BARRY	How many tickets can I put you down for?
ROB	None.  Christ!
BARRY	You're not even coming?
ROB	Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
BARRY	So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
ROB	Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.

BARRY	What's up?
ROB	Laura.  Her dad died.
BARRY	Ooh.  Drag.

ROB	It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
BARRY	Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
ROB	Fuck off, Barry.
BARRY	I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
ROB	Because it's in The Big Chill.
BARRY	Haven't seen it.
ROB	Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
BARRY	Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
ROB	Not really.

BARRY	The little skate-fuckers.
ROB	No way.
BARRY	Yes way.  It's really...

BARRY	What the fuck is that?
ROB	What?
BARRY	I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
ROB	So?  You even said they're good.
BARRY	HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?

ROB	Like fuck you are.
BARRY	Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
ROB	I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
BARRY	We're getting that anyway.
ROB	What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
BARRY	No.  We need the gig.
ROB	110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
BARRY	We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
ROB	You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
BARRY	We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
ROB	Sonic Death Monkey.
BARRY	What do you think?  Dick likes it.
ROB	Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
BARRY	I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
ROB	You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
BARRY	That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.

CUSTOMER	I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
BARRY	Oh yeah.  We got it.

CUSTOMER	Great.  Can I have it then?
BARRY	No, you can't.

CUSTOMER	Why not?
BARRY	Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
CUSTOMER	What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
BARRY	Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?

BARRY	It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
CUSTOMER	I have all of the others.
BARRY	Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
CUSTOMER	They always seemed...
BARRY	They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.

CUSTOMER	Well what about the new Echo --
BARRY	Do not get ahead of yourself.

BARRY	That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
CUSTOMER	I have a television.
BARRY	NO--!

BARRY	Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
DICK	It's the new --

DICK	Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
BARRY	No.  The Righteous Brothers.
DICK	Oh well.  Nevermind.

BARRY	What?
DICK	Nothing.
BARRY	No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
DICK	Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
BARRY	Bullshit.

DICK	She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
BARRY	Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
DICK	That's what I said.
BARRY	No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
DICK	It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
BARRY	You can be and are wrong.

DICK	He's got one!
BARRY	On Clark Street!
DICK	A couple blocks!  About six!
BARRY	We work there!
DICK	You'd love it!

DICK	I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
BARRY	Why?

BARRY	Who are you going to see?
DICK	Nobody.

DICK	Anna.
BARRY	Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
DICK	Anna Moss.
BARRY	Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?

DICK	Don't do it, Rob!
BARRY	He's not worth it!

BARRY	Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
DICK	Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
BARRY	-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.

BARRY	Somebody's Gonna Die by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
LAURA	No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.

LAURA	Hey, Barry.
BARRY	Oh, hi.
LAURA	Where's Rob?
BARRY	The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
LAURA	What are you talking about?
BARRY	Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.

ROB	May I help you?
CAROLINE	I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
ROB	Uh.  That's me.
CAROLINE	I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
ROB	Right.  Why?
CAROLINE	Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
ROB	Oh.  Okay.
CAROLINE	I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
ROB	Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.

ROB	What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
CAROLINE	So.  Is now a good time?

CAROLINE	Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
ROB	Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.

CAROLINE	Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
ROB	Pardon me?
CAROLINE	Your desert island top-five.
ROB	Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
CAROLINE	Is there a difference?
ROB	OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
CAROLINE	Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
ROB	What do you mean, four more?
CAROLINE	Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
ROB	Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
CAROLINE	Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.

ROB	Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
CAROLINE	Fine.  That's great.
ROB	Is that it?
CAROLINE	Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
ROB	Sure, but is that it for the list?
CAROLINE	That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
ROB	Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
CAROLINE	Nice friend.
ROB	Yeah.
CAROLINE	What's his name?
ROB	Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
CAROLINE	Music for Old People. What does that mean?
ROB	Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City."

CAROLINE	Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
ROB	Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
CAROLINE	And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
ROB	Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
CAROLINE	Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
ROB	Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.

CHARLIE	Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
ROB	Yeah, sure...
CHARLIE	Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
ROB	Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
CHARLIE	Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
ROB	Uh...yes, at the moment.
CHARLIE	Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.

ROB	Hey Charlie.
CHARLIE	Hey Rob.
ROB	Why did you break up with me for Marco?
CHARLIE	Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
ROB	Huh?
CHARLIE	There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
ROB	C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?

CHARLIE	It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
ROB	Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
CHARLIE	Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

ROB	'Morning, Dick.
DICK	Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
ROB	Good weekend?
DICK	Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
ROB	Great.
DICK	I'll tape it for you.
ROB	No, that's okay.  Really.
DICK	'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
ROB	Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
DICK	Well, I'll just make it for you.
ROB	Okay.

ROB	What's this?
DICK	The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?

ROB	Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
DICK	Can I help you?

DICK	Are you all right?
ROB	Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
DICK	'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.

DICK	I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
ROB	Fine.
DICK	I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.

DICK	Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
ROB	I understand, Dick.
DICK	Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?

ROB	I always hated this song.
DICK	Yeah.

ROB	Let's not.
DICK	I want a tape.

DICK	Rob.
ROB	Liz, hold on a second --  What?
DICK	Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!

DICK	Rob --!
ROB	-- FUCK OFF!

ROB	I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
DICK	Do it.  Do it.

DICK	Well we rang $900 today.
ROB	Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.

ROB	Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
DICK	Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.

DICK	I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
ROB	You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.

ROB	Can I do anything?
DICK	Abraham, Martin, and John. That's a nice one.

ROB	What is this.
DICK	It's Vince and Justin.
ROB	Who's that?

IAN	Laura?  Are you okay?
LAURA	I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.

LAURA	Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
IAN	You look upset.
LAURA	I'm upset, but I'm fine.
IAN	Maybe I should talk to him.
LAURA	Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
IAN	Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
LAURA	Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.

ROB	Can I help you?
IAN	Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.

ROB	What needs sorting out?
IAN	Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
ROB	Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
IAN	We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
ROB	Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
IAN	We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
ROB	Yeah.
IAN	Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB	I dunno.
IAN	Think about it, Rob.

IAN	Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB	I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.

IAN	Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB	We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.

IAN	So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB	I dunno.
IAN	Think about it, Rob.

ROB	You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
LAURA	We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
ROB	Well stay for tonight, then.

ROB	Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
LAURA	I should be so lucky.

ROB	Shit!
LAURA	Hi.
ROB	Hi.
LAURA	I thought I could give you a lift back.
ROB	Are you coming home?
LAURA	Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
ROB	My house?

ROB	How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
LAURA	It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
ROB	-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
LAURA	-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
ROB	-- Alright, alright but --
LAURA	-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?

ROB	Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
LAURA	Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
ROB	But don't you remember?
LAURA	I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.

ROB	You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
LAURA	Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
ROB	So you weren't interested in music at all?
LAURA	Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?

ROB	But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
LAURA	You really believe that?

ROB	Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
LAURA	And do you like it that way?
ROB	Not really.

LAURA	Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
ROB	Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?

ROB	So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
LAURA	I think you know that.
ROB	Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?

LAURA	I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
ROB	Good.  So.  Is it my job?
LAURA	What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
ROB	I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
LAURA	What were the others?
ROB	Just the obvious stuff.
LAURA	What's the obvious stuff?
ROB	I don't know.

LAURA	I guess it's not that obvious, then.
ROB	No.

LAURA	What?
ROB	What, what?

LAURA	Did you say something?
ROB	No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
LAURA	Rob.  Don't be childish.
ROB	Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
LAURA	I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
ROB	Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?

LAURA	Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
ROB	So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
LAURA	I don't know.
ROB	Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
LAURA	I suppose so.
ROB	So we have a chance of getting back together again.
LAURA	Oh, Rob, shut up.
ROB	Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
LAURA	-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!

ROB	Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
LAURA	Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
ROB	Yeah.  Great.
LAURA	I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
ROB	No problem.  If I can ask one question.
LAURA	Fine.  One.
ROB	It sounds stupid.
LAURA	Nevermind.
ROB	You won't like it.
LAURA	Just ask it!
ROB	Is it better?
LAURA	Is what better?  Better than what?
ROB	Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
LAURA	Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
ROB	Of course it is.
LAURA	You really think it would make a difference either way?
ROB	I don't know.
LAURA	Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
ROB	Never?
LAURA	I haven't felt like it.
ROB	But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
LAURA	No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
ROB	The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
LAURA	Will you please just go?

ROB	Hi.
LAURA	Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
ROB	I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
LAURA	I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
ROB	Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
LAURA	We'll talk some other time.
ROB	Great... That's great.

LAURA	So, how are you?
ROB	Have you slept with him yet?
LAURA	I told you I slept with him.
ROB	No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
LAURA	Is that why you wanted to see me?
ROB	I guess.
LAURA	Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
ROB	I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.

ROB	You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
LAURA	You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.

LAURA	And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
ROB	Nothing.
LAURA	We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
ROB	Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
LAURA	Will you call me?
ROB	I don't have your number.
LAURA	Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
ROB	You do, huh.

LAURA	Hello.
ROB	It's me.
LAURA	I figured it was.  Where are you?
ROB	I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
LAURA	I'm not -- hold on...

ROB	Are you still in love with me?
LAURA	Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
ROB	Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
LAURA	I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
ROB	I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
LAURA	You don't ever think about other people?
ROB	No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.

LAURA	I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
ROB	Is that the last of it?
LAURA	Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
ROB	Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
LAURA	He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
ROB	It was kind of funny.

LAURA	I'm sure.
ROB	You still together?  Going all right?
LAURA	I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
ROB	That bad, eh?
LAURA	You know what I mean.

LAURA	Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
ROB	I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
LAURA	You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
ROB	I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
LAURA	Ray.  I hate Ian.
ROB	I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."

ROB	This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
LAURA	You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
ROB	You know I'm a good person.
LAURA	Mmm hmm.
ROB	You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
LAURA	Oh ho, so very infrequently.

ROB	Don't forget your CDs.
LAURA	Those aren't mine.
ROB	Sure they are.
LAURA	They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
ROB	Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
LAURA	I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
ROB	I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
LAURA	You're being deliberately obtuse.
ROB	I guess I am.
LAURA	Well, think about it.

LAURA	Hello.
ROB	Hey, how ya doin'?

ROB	Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
LAURA	I can't talk right now.
ROB	God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.

ROB	Are you alright?
LAURA	Pigsty.
ROB	Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
LAURA	Pig died.
ROB	Who the fuck's Pig?
LAURA	My dad died.  My dad, my dad.

LAURA	I'm sorry.
ROB	No, no.  When are you going home?
LAURA	In a minute.  When I get it together.

ROB	Me?
LAURA	My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
ROB	Do you want me to be there?
LAURA	I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.

LAURA	Look, are you coming or not?
ROB	Yes, of course.
LAURA	Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
ROB	Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.

LAURA	Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
ROB	Uh... No.

LAURA	You're soaking.
ROB	Mmnn.
LAURA	You're also an idiot.

ROB	I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
LAURA	Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
ROB	What do you mean?
LAURA	I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
ROB	Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
LAURA	I don't want to go back.
ROB	What do you want to do?
LAURA	C'mon.

ROB	When are you going back?
LAURA	I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
ROB	What?
LAURA	I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
ROB	I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
LAURA	It'll have to be sex, then.

LAURA	Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
ROB	Hi.
LAURA	I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.

ROB	You know, with Ray...
LAURA	Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
ROB	No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
LAURA	Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
ROB	I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?

ROB	Look, we can do other things.
LAURA	I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?

ROB	Laura...
LAURA	I'm too tired not to go out with you.

ROB	So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
LAURA	Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
ROB	What about Ian?
LAURA	Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
ROB	Mission accomplished.
LAURA	I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...

LAURA	Let's go home.  Okay?
ROB	Okay.

ROB	C'mon.  I want to know.
LAURA	Want to know what, exactly?
ROB	What it was like.
LAURA	It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
ROB	Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
LAURA	What's the difference?
ROB	You know the difference.
LAURA	Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
ROB	Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?

ROB	Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
LAURA	Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
ROB	Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
LAURA	To make you feel better.
ROB	Oh, great...

LAURA	Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
ROB	Okay.

LAURA	... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
ROB	Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
LAURA	I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
ROB	Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
LAURA	Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
ROB	But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
LAURA	How?  How were we the same people?
ROB	Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
LAURA	Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
ROB	No, but...
LAURA	But what?
ROB	But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
LAURA	You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
ROB	And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
LAURA	I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
ROB	You're tougher.
LAURA	More confident, maybe.
ROB	Harder.
LAURA	Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
ROB	I'm alright.
LAURA	Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
ROB	You're being stupid.
LAURA	How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?

LAURA	All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
ROB	No use.

ROB	Hi.
LAURA	Hi.  What are you doing?
ROB	Nothing.
LAURA	Wanna go to dinner?
ROB	Where?
LAURA	At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
ROB	Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
LAURA	I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
ROB	Ha.

ROB	You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
LAURA	I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.

LAURA	I called Dan Koretzky because he --
ROB	Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
LAURA	Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
ROB	WHAT?
LAURA	Just local, of course.
ROB	And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
LAURA	I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
ROB	You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
LAURA	What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
ROB	That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
LAURA	Barry said its done.
ROB	Barry?  Barry knows about this?
LAURA	Yeah.  His band is playing a set.

LAURA	They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
ROB	It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
LAURA	We took care of that.

ROB	I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
LAURA	That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
ROB	I know.  I don't get it.

LAURA	Are you worried about tomorrow night?
ROB	Not really.

LAURA	Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
ROB	I'm going to talk to you.
LAURA	Right.

LAURA	What are you going to talk to me about?
ROB	I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
LAURA	Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
ROB	I mean it.
LAURA	I know.
ROB	Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
LAURA	I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
ROB	Not in love, exactly, but...
LAURA	Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
ROB	Would you marry me if I was?
LAURA	No.  Probably not.
ROB	Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
LAURA	Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
ROB	I don't know.
LAURA	Very persuasive.
ROB	Are you persuadable?
LAURA	No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
ROB	Fair enough.
LAURA	So?
ROB	I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
LAURA	About what?
ROB	This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
LAURA	I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
ROB	Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
LAURA	I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
ROB	I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
LAURA	Well, you've asked.

ROB	I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
LAURA	It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.

ROB	Rob here.
LIZ	Hey.  It's Liz.
ROB	What's happenin'.
LIZ	You called this morning?
ROB	Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
LIZ	How're you holding up?
ROB	Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
LIZ	Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --

ROB	What's the -- hey, Liz --
LIZ	-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.

LIZ	To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
ROB	It's true!
LIZ	Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
ROB	Well she --

ROB	So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
LIZ	It's a crematorium.
ROB	You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
LIZ	What difference does it make?
ROB	Is Ray going?
LIZ	No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
ROB	Isn't that how it is for everybody?

ROB	Enough, Liz.
LIZ	Enough of what?
ROB	I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
LIZ	Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
ROB	Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
LIZ	If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.

MARIE	Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
ROB	Good.

ROB	So you live in Chicago now?
MARIE	Yup.  Not far from here, actually.

MARIE	Don't you like that?
ROB	No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.

ROB	Hi, Marie.
MARIE	Everything go alright?

ROB	She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
MARIE	God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
ROB	It's a great song.
MARIE	Thank you.

ROB	Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
MARIE	Yup.

ROB	You share a place with T-Bone?
MARIE	No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
ROB	I understand completely.

ROB	Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
MARIE	Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
ROB	What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
MARIE	Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.

ROB	Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
ROB	Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
MARIE	The Conformist.
ROB	Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
MARIE	You haven't even seen it!
ROB	Nor have you!

MARIE	Are you okay?
ROB	Yes.  You?
MARIE	For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
ROB	I'm sure it isn't.
MARIE	Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
ROB	Whiskey.

MARIE	Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
ROB	I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
MARIE	When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.

MARIE	I'd like it if you could stay the night.
ROB	Oh, right.  Alright.
MARIE	Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
ROB	I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
MARIE	So you'll stay?
ROB	Yeah.
MARIE	Good.

ROB	Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
MARIE	God, you ask a lot of questions.

ROB	Which way are you going?
MARIE	That way.  You?
ROB	That way.
MARIE	And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
ROB	I'll call you.
MARIE	Right.

ROB	Yeah?
MOM	Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.

ROB	Hi, Mom.
MOM	Everything all right?
ROB	Great.  Super-fantastic.
MOM	How's the store?
ROB	So so.  Up and down.
MOM	Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...

ROB	She left.  She's gone.
MOM	What do you mean?  Where did she go?
ROB	How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
MOM	Well call her mother.
ROB	She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...

ROB	Hello?  Anybody there?
ROB	I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
MOM	You know that's not what's upsetting me.
ROB	Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
MOM	I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
ROB	I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
MOM	And after that?
ROB	Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
MOM	I knew this was going to happen.
ROB	Then what are you getting so upset about?
MOM	What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
ROB	It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
MOM	So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
ROB	Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
MOM	Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.

WOMAN	What do you think?
ROB	It's the best collection I've ever seen.
WOMAN	Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.

ROB	These are worth at least, I don't know --
WOMAN	I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
ROB	But you must have --
WOMAN	I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
ROB	And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
WOMAN	He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
ROB	It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
WOMAN	Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.

ROB	Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
WOMAN	That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
ROB	Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
WOMAN	Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
ROB	That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
WOMAN	Sixty.
ROB	Thirteen hundred.
WOMAN	Seventy-five.
ROB	Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
WOMAN	And I won't take a penny over ninety.

WOMAN	With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
ROB	I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
WOMAN	Fine.

ROB	Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
WOMAN	Sure.  Ten cents.
ROB	Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
WOMAN	Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.

ROB	Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
VINCE	Naw.  Those are for us.
ROB	Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?

ROB	I think you have more.
VINCE	Well we don't.
ROB	I can't frisk you but the cops can.

ROB	Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
VINCE	No, we...

ROB	Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
VINCE	Records are those big round black things, right?
ROB	Fuck off.

ROB	It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
VINCE	Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
ROB	We're not there yet, Justin.
VINCE	I'm Vince.
ROB	Whatever.

VINCE	We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
ROB	Nice.
VINCE	What's the name of your label?

MURPHY	Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
BENSINGER	Why don't you fellows get your own news?

MURPHY	This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
BENSINGER	A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
MURPHY	Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
BENSINGER	The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
MURPHY	And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.

HILDY	Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
BENSINGER	Hildy!

BENSINGER	Are you back?
HILDY	No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
BENSINGER	What doing?
HILDY	I'm getting married tomorrow.
BENSINGER	Well, congratulations! Good luck!

HILDY	Who is it?
BENSINGER	What's the idea of locking this?
HILDY	That's Bensinger. That's his desk.

HILDY	Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
BENSINGER	Open this door!

BENSINGER	Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
BURNS	Hello, Bensinger.
BENSINGER	Excuse me, I just want to --

BENSINGER	How do you mean?
BURNS	I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
BENSINGER	Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
BURNS	I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
BENSINGER	Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
BURNS	The poem?... The poem was great!
BENSINGER	Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
BURNS	Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
BENSINGER	What?

BURNS	Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
BENSINGER	No. Roy. Roy V.
BURNS	Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
BENSINGER	Seventy-five.
BURNS	I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.

BURNS	Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
BENSINGER	Sort of a Jack London style?
BURNS	Exactly!

BENSINGER	I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
BURNS	It doesn't have to rhyme!

BURNS	I'll keep you in mind.
BENSINGER	Au revoir, mon capitaine.
BURNS	Bon jour!

HILDY	I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
BRUCE	Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.

BRUCE	I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
HILDY	Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
BRUCE	I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
HILDY	My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
BRUCE	I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
HILDY	I'll come a-running, pardner.

BRUCE	Oh, it isn't like that.
HILDY	It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.

BRUCE	You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
HILDY	You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
BRUCE	Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
HILDY	He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
BRUCE	If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
HILDY	That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.

BRUCE	Too hot?
HILDY	No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.

BRUCE	Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
HILDY	He certainly -- hic -- does!

BRUCE	I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
HILDY	Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
BRUCE	Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
HILDY	And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
BRUCE	But --
HILDY	According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
BRUCE	I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.

BRUCE	About twenty-five hundred dollars.
HILDY	Better make that a certified check, Walter.

BRUCE	All right, dear.
HILDY	Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
BRUCE	The five hundred? Sure.
HILDY	On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
BRUCE	But --
HILDY	Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
BRUCE	But I don't gamble, Hilda!
HILDY	I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
BRUCE	All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
HILDY	I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.

HILDY	Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
BRUCE	Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.

BRUCE	All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
HILDY	Fine. And here's a kiss for you.

HILDY	What's the matter?
BRUCE	I lost my wallet.
HILDY	The check, Bruce!

BRUCE	That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
HILDY	Yes, wasn't it?
BRUCE	I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
HILDY	I'm sure you haven't any.
BRUCE	For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
HILDY	Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
BRUCE	Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
HILDY	Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
BRUCE	Did you finish the interview?
HILDY	The Criminal Courts Building.

HILDY	No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
BRUCE	But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
HILDY	Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.

BRUCE	Hildy!
HILDY	Hello, Bruce...

HILDY	BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
BRUCE	Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
HILDY	Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --

BRUCE	I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
HILDY	We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
BRUCE	I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
HILDY	Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!

HILDY	Oh, she was here.
BRUCE	Where'd she go?
HILDY	Out some place.

BRUCE	Hildy! Where's mother?
HILDY	Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
BRUCE	Did you give her the money?
HILDY	No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
BRUCE	Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
HILDY	Oh, yes. Here it is.

HILDY	Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
BRUCE	Thank you.

HILDY	Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
BRUCE	You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.

BRUCE	I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
HILDY	Fine.

BRUCE	Mr. Burns --
BURNS	I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
BRUCE	I'm Bruce Baldwin!

BURNS	You're Bruce Baldwin?
BRUCE	Yes!
BURNS	Then who are you?

BURNS	This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
BURNS	Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
BRUCE	Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
BURNS	You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
BRUCE	Oh.
BURNS	But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
BRUCE	Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
BURNS	That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.

BURNS	Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
BRUCE	Where are we going?
BURNS	Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
BRUCE	No -- she didn't.
BURNS	Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!

BURNS	Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
BRUCE	Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
BURNS	Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?

BURNS	Mother? But your mother --
BRUCE	No. My mother.
BURNS	Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.

BURNS	I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
BRUCE	I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.

BRUCE	Well, I'll try to give her one.
BURNS	I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
BRUCE	Just for the first year.
BURNS	That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!

BRUCE	Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
BURNS	Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...

BURNS	How's business, Bruce?
BRUCE	Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
BURNS	I don't blame them.

BURNS	I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
BRUCE	Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
BURNS	I see what you mean.

BRUCE	Anything the matter?
BURNS	Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.

BRUCE	Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
BURNS	It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.

BRUCE	Are you sure Williams is not all there?
BURNS	All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
BRUCE	But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
BURNS	How?

BRUCE	How long would the interview take?
BURNS	Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
BRUCE	We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.

BRUCE	I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
BURNS	You haven't seen anything yet.

BRUCE	I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
BURNS	Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
BRUCE	I feel I ought to take care of her.
BURNS	Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
BRUCE	Well, I'm independent, too.
BURNS	Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
BRUCE	Well, of course, if you put it that way.
BURNS	And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
BRUCE	I'm beginning to realize that.
BURNS	And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
BRUCE	Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
BURNS	No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.

BURNS	Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
BRUCE	Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.

BRUCE	Well, she'll know some day.
BURNS	That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.

BURNS	Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
BRUCE	Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.

BURNS	Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
BRUCE	Thanks a lot.

BURNS	Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
BRUCE	Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
BURNS	Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
BRUCE	So long.

BRUCE	Hildy!
BURNS	What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?

BURNS	No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
BRUCE	Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.

BRUCE	And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
BURNS	Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --

BURNS	I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
BRUCE	If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!

BURNS	I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
BRUCE	Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
BURNS	Ts! Ts! Ts!
BRUCE	And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
BURNS	I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
BRUCE	She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
BURNS	That's the kind of stuff they want!

BURNS	Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
BRUCE	The money? Why?
BURNS	There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
BRUCE	Gee! Take a look, will you?

BURNS	Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
BRUCE	Say, I want to be sure, too!

BURNS	Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
HARTMAN	You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.

BURNS	If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
HARTMAN	You'll ask me to what?
BURNS	Get out!
HARTMAN	Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.

BURNS	I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
HARTMAN	Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!

BURNS	You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
HARTMAN	I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.

HARTMAN	No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
BURNS	Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
HARTMAN	I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
BURNS	You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
HARTMAN	We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?

BURNS	Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
HARTMAN	You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
BURNS	I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
HARTMAN	We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 

HARTMAN	What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
BURNS	Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!

BURNS	Call Duffy!
HARTMAN	No, you don't!
BURNS	Do you want to get us scooped?

BURNS	You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
HARTMAN	Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.

BURNS	What's this?
HARTMAN	Get out of here, you!

BURNS	Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
MAYOR	Your luck's not with you now!

BURNS	Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
MAYOR	All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
BURNS	This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
MAYOR	The power of the press, huh!

MAYOR	That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
BURNS	Out of the mouths of babes.
MAYOR	He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?

BURNS	Save that for the Tribune.
MAYOR	What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?

BURNS	What do you want?
HILDY	Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
BURNS	Hello, Hildy!
HILDY	Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?

HILDY	How long is what?
BURNS	You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
HILDY	Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
BURNS	Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
HILDY	No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
BURNS	Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --

HILDY	You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
BURNS	I notice you still remember it.
HILDY	I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
BURNS	You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
HILDY	Done what?
BURNS	Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
HILDY	Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
BURNS	Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
HILDY	I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
BURNS	Now, that's a nice thing to say.
HILDY	Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
BURNS	Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
HILDY	A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
BURNS	Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
HILDY	What home?

BURNS	Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
HILDY	All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
BURNS	Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
HILDY	Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
BURNS	Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
HILDY	What?!!
BURNS	I haven't any hard feelings.
HILDY	Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
BURNS	Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
HILDY	I have a lunch date. I just want --
BURNS	You can break it, can't you?
HILDY	No, I can't.
BURNS	Sure you can. Come on.
HILDY	Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
BURNS	What do you mean by that?
HILDY	Just what I said. That's what I --
BURNS	You mean you're not coming back to work here?
HILDY	That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
BURNS	You've had a better offer, eh?
HILDY	You bet I've got a better offer.
BURNS	Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
HILDY	I know, Walter, but I --
BURNS	What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
HILDY	You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
BURNS	Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
HILDY	Listen, Walter --
BURNS	I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
HILDY	Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
BURNS	It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
HILDY	I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
BURNS	Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
HILDY	You -- you --

BURNS	Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
HILDY	What's the matter?
BURNS	Sweeney.
HILDY	Dead?
BURNS	Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
HILDY	Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
BURNS	I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
HILDY	Well, haven't you got anybody else?
BURNS	There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
HILDY	No!
BURNS	You've got to help me, Hildy.
HILDY	Keep away --
BURNS	It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
HILDY	That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
BURNS	Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
HILDY	Get away, Svengali.
BURNS	If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
HILDY	Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
BURNS	All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
HILDY	Please! Will you just --
BURNS	Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
HILDY	I'm not working for any other paper!
BURNS	Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
HILDY	Look at this! 

HILDY	I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
BURNS	Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
HILDY	You can't sell me that, Walter.
BURNS	Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
HILDY	That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
BURNS	I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
HILDY	A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
BURNS	Where'd you meet this man?
HILDY	Bermuda.
BURNS	Bermuda... Rich, eh?
HILDY	Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
BURNS	What's his line?
HILDY	He's in the insurance business.
BURNS	The insurance business?
HILDY	It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
BURNS	Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
HILDY	Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
BURNS	He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
HILDY	I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
BURNS	Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
HILDY	Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
BURNS	Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
HILDY	The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
BURNS	I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
HILDY	Thanks...
BURNS	Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
HILDY	Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
BURNS	Say, could I meet him?
HILDY	Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
BURNS	You're not afraid, are you?
HILDY	Afraid? I should say not!
BURNS	All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
HILDY	Better.

BURNS	Then what does he want with you?
HILDY	Now you got me.
BURNS	Nothing personal. I was just asking.

HILDY	You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
BURNS	No kidding?

HILDY	And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
BURNS	What for?
HILDY	And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
BURNS	Oh, I'm sorry.

HILDY	Allow me.
BURNS	Thanks.

HILDY	I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
BURNS	How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!

BURNS	Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
HILDY	I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
BURNS	Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.

BURNS	Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
HILDY	Thank you.

HILDY	What now?
BURNS	His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
HILDY	You said it.
BURNS	So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.

HILDY	If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
BURNS	Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
HILDY	The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
BURNS	Especially with an election coming up in a few days.

HILDY	No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
BURNS	I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
HILDY	Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
BURNS	You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!

BURNS	How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
HILDY	What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
BURNS	What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
HILDY	Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
BURNS	What do you mean?
HILDY	I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
BURNS	All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
HILDY	We're not interested.
BURNS	Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?

BURNS	Now you're talking!
HILDY	You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
BURNS	What tricks would I pull?
HILDY	Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?

BURNS	What do you think I am -- a crook?
HILDY	Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
BURNS	All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
HILDY	No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.

BURNS	Exclusive? That's great.
HILDY	It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
BURNS	Never mind that. What's the story?
HILDY	Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
BURNS	You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
HILDY	Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
BURNS	I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
HILDY	Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --

HILDY	Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
BURNS	No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
HILDY	No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
BURNS	That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
HILDY	It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
BURNS	Hold on a minute.

HILDY	Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
BURNS	Yes. Where is he?
HILDY	She jumped out of the window.
BURNS	I know. Where is he, I said.

BURNS	Where do you think you're going?
HILDY	Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
BURNS	Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
HILDY	Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
BURNS	You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
HILDY	I know, but --
BURNS	You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
HILDY	Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
BURNS	Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
HILDY	I'd like to think.
BURNS	Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
HILDY	I get it!
BURNS	You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
HILDY	Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
BURNS	Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
HILDY	Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
BURNS	We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
HILDY	That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.

BURNS	Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
HILDY	You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
BURNS	We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.

BURNS	Hildy!
HILDY	Huh!
BURNS	Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
HILDY	How much do you want on it?
BURNS	All the words you've got.
HILDY	Where's some paper?

HILDY	Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
BURNS	Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!

HILDY	How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
BURNS	Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!

BURNS	For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
HILDY	Okay, Walter. 

BURNS	Hildy!
HILDY	All right, Walter.

BURNS	Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
HILDY	Where's Butch?

BURNS	Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
HILDY	Where's Bruce?
BURNS	Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
HILDY	What tickets?
BURNS	Railroad tickets.
HILDY	Is he coming back here?
BURNS	Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?

HILDY	Double-crossing swine!
BURNS	You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.

BURNS	Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
HILDY	I'm finished.
BURNS	Finished!

HILDY	Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
BURNS	Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.

HILDY	Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
BURNS	What did you do with her?
HILDY	What happened?
BURNS	You been in a fight?

BURNS	Where is she? Tell me!
HILDY	Louie!

HILDY	Don't tell me -- was she killed?
BURNS	Was she? Did you notice?

BURNS	It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
HILDY	What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
BURNS	If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
HILDY	I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!

BURNS	Look at me, Hildy --
HILDY	I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
BURNS	If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
HILDY	Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!

BURNS	Hello -- hello...
HILDY	Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
BURNS	Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
HILDY	Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
BURNS	What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
HILDY	Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
BURNS	Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
HILDY	Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
BURNS	I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
HILDY	Is this the Community Hospital?
BURNS	I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
HILDY	Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
BURNS	Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
HILDY	Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
BURNS	Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.

HILDY	Lafayette two-one-hundred.
BURNS	That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?

HILDY	Ring that number, will you?
BURNS	Come here. See if we can move it.
HILDY	Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
BURNS	Will you come here?
HILDY	Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
BURNS	When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
HILDY	Yes.

BURNS	Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
HILDY	I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!

BURNS	Don't open that!
HILDY	Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --

HILDY	No, you don't! Walter!
BURNS	What is it? Here!

HILDY	No!
BURNS	Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.

HILDY	Wait a minute!  Let go there!
BURNS	Murder, uh?
HILDY	Hanging an innocent man to win an election!

BURNS	When did you deliver this first?
HILDY	Who did you talk to?

BURNS	Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
HILDY	Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
BURNS	And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.

HILDY	How was that for a tight squeeze?
BURNS	Don't tell me you were worried!
HILDY	Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
BURNS	Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
HILDY	In a way.
BURNS	I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
HILDY	We've certainly been in some swell jams.
BURNS	Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
HILDY	Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
BURNS	Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
HILDY	We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
BURNS	In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
HILDY	Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --

BURNS	Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
HILDY	That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
BURNS	Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
HILDY	Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
BURNS	Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
HILDY	Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
BURNS	He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
HILDY	I don't know what to do, Walter.
BURNS	Flip a coin.
HILDY	All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?

BURNS	Well -- what is it?
HILDY	What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!

BURNS	Hildy!
HILDY	Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
BURNS	Then why are you doing it?
HILDY	Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!

BURNS	The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
HILDY	Thanks.
BURNS	And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
HILDY	Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
BURNS	What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
HILDY	No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
BURNS	Where'd you wire him?
HILDY	On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
BURNS	Sure.
HILDY	It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
BURNS	Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
HILDY	Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
BURNS	Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
HILDY	A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
BURNS	That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
HILDY	Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
BURNS	Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
HILDY	Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
BURNS	Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
HILDY	Walter!
BURNS	Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
HILDY	What would you do if it was a daughter?
BURNS	Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
HILDY	What's the matter with my brains?
BURNS	What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
HILDY	Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
BURNS	I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.

HILDY	What!
BURNS	Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?

HILDY	That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
BURNS	Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
HILDY	You're not fooling anybody.

BURNS	How about Bruce's?
HILDY	Walter, you can't do that!
BURNS	Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."

BURNS	Hildy, darling!
HILDY	Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
BURNS	It'll be Heaven!
HILDY	Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!

BURNS	But, Hildy -- I can explain --
HILDY	You -- you!!

BURNS	Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
MRS. BALDWIN	What's that -- what's that?

BURNS	Are you referring to me, Madam?
MRS. BALDWIN	You know you did!

BURNS	Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
MRS. BALDWIN	I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!

MRS. BALDWIN	Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
BURNS	You grey-haired old Judas!
MRS. BALDWIN	Let me out! Let me out of here!

LOUIE	Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
BURNS	Take that mush out of your mouth!

BURNS	Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
LOUIE	What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
BURNS	Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
LOUIE	I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?

BURNS	You stay here. I'll find out everything.
LOUIE	Western an' Thirty-fourth.

LOUIE	Anything you want, Boss.
BURNS	Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
LOUIE	Who do you want?
BURNS	Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.

LOUIE	You know me. The shirt off my back.
BURNS	You got plenty of money?
LOUIE	Sure, boss.
BURNS	I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
LOUIE	I always have both.

DUFFY	Walter!
BURNS	I'm busy, Duffy.
DUFFY	Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
BURNS	What?
DUFFY	And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
BURNS	You're crazy. Where's Mac?
DUFFY	He's on my phone. He just called me.
BURNS	They can't do that to me!

DUFFY	Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
BURNS	Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.

DUFFY	Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
BURNS	Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 

COOLEY	Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
HILDY	I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
COOLEY	No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.

HILDY	Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
COOLEY	I think it is.
HILDY	I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.

HILDY	Cooley, I want to talk to you.
COOLEY	Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --

HILDY	There's money in it, Cooley.
COOLEY	I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
HILDY	A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --

COOLEY	How much?
HILDY	Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
COOLEY	It's a deal. Let me up.

COOLEY	Let's see the money.
HILDY	First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?

EGELHOFFER	The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
HARTMAN	You said it!
EGELHOFFER	They're always after me for interviews.
HARTMAN	Me, too.
EGELHOFFER	Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
HARTMAN	Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
EGELHOFFER	We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
HARTMAN	A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
EGELHOFFER	Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
HARTMAN	It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
EGELHOFFER	Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.

HARTMAN	I don't know --
EGELHOFFER	Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.

WILLIAMS	Are you gentlemen all through with me?
EGELHOFFER	Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?

EGELHOFFER	You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
WILLIAMS	The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
EGELHOFFER	I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
WILLIAMS	In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.

EGELHOFFER	Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
WILLIAMS	Yes, sir.

EGELHOFFER	So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
WILLIAMS	Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
EGELHOFFER	Point the gun at me!

ENDICOTT	Well, that about covers everything.
HILDY	Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?

ENDICOTT	Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
HILDY	I know, I just want to give him a thrill.

ENDICOTT	I call. What you got?
HILDY	Three bullets! Any good?
ENDICOTT	Beats king up.

ENDICOTT	Who locked the door?
HILDY	Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!

ENDICOTT	Open up there, will you!
HILDY	All right -- all right!

ENDICOTT	Hey!
HILDY	Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!

ENDICOTT	Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
HILDY	Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?

ENDICOTT	Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
HILDY	Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.

ENDICOTT	She looks as though she's going to come to.
HILDY	Give me a hand with her, will you?
ENDICOTT	Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.

HILDY	A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
ENDICOTT	It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.

ENDICOTT	Better let us in on it, Mollie.
HILDY	Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!

MURPHY	That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
ENDICOTT	This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
MURPHY	Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
ENDICOTT	Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!

ENDICOTT	Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
MURPHY	What have you got, Hildy?

MURPHY	Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
ENDICOTT	Who's this guy she's gonna marry?

MURPHY	She says she's gonna write fiction.
ENDICOTT	Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.

MURPHY	You guys wanna play some more poker?
ENDICOTT	What's the use? I can't win a pot.

MURPHY	Boy, did you see her go?
ENDICOTT	Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.

ENDICOTT	No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
MURPHY	The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
ENDICOTT	Call you back.

MURPHY	So have we!
ENDICOTT	What's the dope, Sheriff?
MURPHY	Who engineered this getaway?

MURPHY	Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
ENDICOTT	Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?

MURPHY	Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
ENDICOTT	I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.

MURPHY	Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
ENDICOTT	Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
MURPHY	Where is he, before we beat it out of you?

MURPHY	Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
ENDICOTT	Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!

ENDICOTT	Hold the phone!
MURPHY	I'll have it in a minute.

MCCUE	I'll call.
ENDICOTT	Three sixes. Is that any good?

ENDICOTT	Goodbye, Yonson.
MCCUE	So long, Hildy.

MCCUE	What a chase!
ENDICOTT	No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.

MCCUE	You ain't gettin' out o' here!
ENDICOTT	Now, where is he?

MCCUE	We know what you're up to.
ENDICOTT	Probably goin' out to get Williams.

HILDY	How's everything, Gus?
GUS	I can't complain.

HILDY	Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
GUS	Little rum in yours, too?
HILDY	I guess so.

HILDY	No -- just coffee, Gus.
GUS	Just coffee.  And you, sir?

HILDY	Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
GUS	That's all right.

HILDY	Gus, this --
GUS	Good coffee, isn't it?

HILDY	Same way you did.  Through that gate.
HARTMAN	I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
HILDY	All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
HARTMAN	Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
HILDY	Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
HARTMAN	Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?

HILDY	No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
HARTMAN	You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
HILDY	That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.

HARTMAN	Just a minute, Johnson!
HILDY	Let go o' me. What's the idea?

HILDY	Take your paws off me!
HARTMAN	Hold her, boys!

HILDY	Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
HARTMAN	Hang onto her! Keep her in here!

HILDY	I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
HARTMAN	Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
HILDY	You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
HARTMAN	I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
HILDY	Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!

HARTMAN	Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
HILDY	What do I know about Williams?
HARTMAN	All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.

HARTMAN	Where'd you get this?
HILDY	I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
HARTMAN	Not this gun!

HILDY	He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
HARTMAN	What?
HILDY	With a bag of marshmallows.

HILDY	He's harmless.
HARTMAN	Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
HILDY	He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.

HILDY	That's murder!
HARTMAN	All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.

HARTMAN	If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
MURPHY	This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
HARTMAN	What went off?
MURPHY	Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
HARTMAN	A fine fair-weather friend you are!
MURPHY	The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
HARTMAN	After all I've done for you --
MURPHY	Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --

MURPHY	Where is he?
HARTMAN	Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.

HARTMAN	I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
PINKUS	You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.

HARTMAN	For who?
PINKUS	Earl Williams. The reprieve.

HARTMAN	Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
PINKUS	Yeah. But I --

HARTMAN	Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
PINKUS	No, I couldn't do that.

HARTMAN	Just one second --
PINKUS	That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.

MAYOR	Pete, I want to talk to you!
HARTMAN	I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
MAYOR	Did you actually give Williams that gun?
HARTMAN	The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
MAYOR	Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --

HARTMAN	Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
MAYOR	Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
HARTMAN	I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
MAYOR	Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
HARTMAN	If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.

MAYOR	Pete, you're through!
HARTMAN	What do you mean -- through?
MAYOR	I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
HARTMAN	Fred!
MAYOR	Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
HARTMAN	Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
MAYOR	I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
HARTMAN	Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
MAYOR	If there was any way out...

HARTMAN	That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
MAYOR	We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.

MAYOR	Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
HARTMAN	Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
MAYOR	I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
HARTMAN	But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.

HARTMAN	The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
MAYOR	And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?

MAYOR	Pure politics!
HARTMAN	An attempt to ruin us!

MAYOR	Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
HARTMAN	We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
MAYOR	Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
HARTMAN	Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
MAYOR	And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
HARTMAN	Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
MAYOR	What is it?
HARTMAN	They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
MAYOR	Tell 'em to hold the wire.
HARTMAN	I did.  Hold the wire.
MAYOR	Cover up that transmitter!

HARTMAN	No -- don't out me off.
MAYOR	How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!

HARTMAN	Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
MAYOR	Now what do you say?

MAYOR	We'll fix that, too. 
HARTMAN	Just -- one -- second!

MAYOR	All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
HARTMAN	What?
MAYOR	Shoot to kill, I said.
HARTMAN	I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
MAYOR	Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
HARTMAN	Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
MAYOR	Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
HARTMAN	If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.

MAYOR	Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
HARTMAN	Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
MAYOR	A sight for sore eyes!
HARTMAN	Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
MAYOR	Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!

MAYOR	Who is this man?
HARTMAN	Throw him out, Frank.

MAYOR	You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
HARTMAN	It's a frame-up! Some imposter!

HARTMAN	That's a lie!!
MAYOR	I never saw him before!

MAYOR	Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
HARTMAN	I was just going to!

MAYOR	Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
HARTMAN	I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.

HARTMAN	And so do I!
MAYOR	So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.

WILLIAMS	Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
HARTMAN	That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
WILLIAMS	I won't.
HARTMAN	Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?

WILLIAMS	I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
HARTMAN	Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.

HARTMAN	Got you, Williams!
WILLIAMS	Go on -- shoot me!

HILDY	Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT	But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
HILDY	And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
LIEUTENANT	Now, Hildy --
HILDY	Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
LIEUTENANT	I can't.
HILDY	All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
LIEUTENANT	Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
HILDY	You can let him out on bail, can't you?
LIEUTENANT	Five hundred dollars.
HILDY	You'll take fifty and like it!
LIEUTENANT	Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.

LOUIE	Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
HILDY	Editorials?

HILDY	Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
LOUIE	My name is Louis Peluso.

HILDY	Where's the old lady?
LOUIE	I'm telling you!

LOUIE	We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
HILDY	Oh-h-h... was she hurt?

LOUIE	I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
HILDY	What did you do with her?
LOUIE	Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
HILDY	-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
LOUIE	Was I? The driver got knocked cold.

HILDY	Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
LOUIE	All right, Judge.

HILDY	Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
WILSON	Phone for you, Hildy.
HILDY	Who is it?
WILSON	Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
HILDY	Give me that!

HILDY	There goes another scrub lady.
WILSON	I'll go right after it.

HILDY	Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
SCHWARTZ	What's the matter? Getting yellow?

HILDY	It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
SCHWARTZ	Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
HILDY	This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.

SCHWARTZ	Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
HILDY	I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!

HILDY	Any news?
SCHWARTZ	Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.

MCCUE	You fight it cut.
HILDY	And up a dime.

HILDY	I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
MCCUE	Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
HILDY	Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.

MCCUE	Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
HILDY	But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
MCCUE	Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
HILDY	I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.

MCCUE	Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
HILDY	I thought so, too.

MCCUE	Did you get that, Hildy?
HILDY	No -- what?

HILDY	If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
MCCUE	Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --

MCCUE	Okay.  Forget it. 
HILDY	What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.

HILDY	Look out, you --
MCCUE	What's the use of fighting, Hildy?

HILDY	Have you got my dough?
LOUIS	Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
HILDY	Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
LOUIS	All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
HILDY	Come on with that money!
LOUIS	First you got to sign a receipt. 
HILDY	Where's the money?
LOUIS	Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
HILDY	Here!
LOUIS	Thanks. So long, Hildy!
HILDY	So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
LOUIS	Huh?
HILDY	None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
LOUIS	Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?

HILDY	You know it is!
LOUIS	I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
HILDY	No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
LOUIS	What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!

HILDY	Kings and sixes.
MURPHY	That's good.
HILDY	'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.

MURPHY	Any dope yet on how he got out?
HILDY	From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.

MURPHY	Hildy, I thought you were gone --
HILDY	Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
MURPHY	Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.

MURPHY	Hiding him where?
HILDY	Mother!

HILDY	Mother!
MRS. BALDWIN	Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
HILDY	Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
MRS. BALDWIN	You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!

HILDY	I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
MRS. BALDWIN	I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.

HILDY	Mother!
MRS. BALDWIN	That man there!
HILDY	Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.

WILLIAMS	I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
HILDY	You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
WILLIAMS	Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
HILDY	What are your beliefs, Earl?
WILLIAMS	They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
HILDY	How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
WILLIAMS	I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
HILDY	Production for use only. Well, maybe that's the answer.
WILLIAMS	It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
HILDY	Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.

WILLIAMS	A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
HILDY	Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
WILLIAMS	Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
HILDY	Very simple, Earl.
WILLIAMS	There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
HILDY	No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
WILLIAMS	Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
HILDY	Isn't that her picture?
WILLIAMS	Yes. Isn't she beautiful?

WILLIAMS	Don't forget about production for use.
HILDY	I won't, Earl. 

WILLIAMS	You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
HILDY	Put down that gun, Earl.

HILDY	You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
WILLIAMS	Yes -- that's right. Production for use.

HILDY	Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
WILLIAMS	Don't move!

WILLIAMS	Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
HILDY	Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
WILLIAMS	No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.

HILDY	Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
WILLIAMS	What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
HILDY	I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
WILLIAMS	Keep away!

HILDY	Earl, you must never do that again.
WILLIAMS	Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
HILDY	Well, maybe you think I could!

HILDY	Don't talk too loud.
WILLIAMS	Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
HILDY	Sure I do, Earl.

HILDY	Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
WILLIAMS	Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
HILDY	How'd you get here, Earl?
WILLIAMS	Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?

HILDY	Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
WILLIAMS	Let 'em take me. It's better that way.

WILLIAMS	What good'll it do?
HILDY	We'll get you out in ten minutes.

HILDY	Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
MOLLIE	They're not human!
HILDY	They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
MOLLIE	It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!

MOLLIE	Where are they gone? You know where they are?
HILDY	Wait a minute, Mollie.

MOLLIE	They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
HILDY	Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
MOLLIE	What do you mean?

MOLLIE	What's that?
HILDY	Quiet, Mollie!
MOLLIE	There's somethin' funny going on around here.

MOLLIE	They'll get him! They'll get him!
HILDY	Ssh!

HILDY	I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
MOLLIE	I'll be right here. I won't leave you.

MOLLIE	What's the idea?
HILDY	Never mind! Just play dead.

MOLLIE	Hey --
HILDY	Shut up, you!

HILDY	Are you all right, now?
MOLLIE	Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.

MAYOR	What do you want?
PINKUS	I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
MAYOR	What's from the Governor?
PINKUS	The reprieve for Earl Williams.

PINKUS	They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
MAYOR	Get the Governor on the phone!
PINKUS	You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
MAYOR	Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!

MAYOR	Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
PINKUS	Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
MAYOR	How much do you make a week?
PINKUS	Huh?
MAYOR	How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
PINKUS	Forty dollars.

PINKUS	Who? Me?
MAYOR	Who do you think!

MAYOR	Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
PINKUS	The what?
MAYOR	The City Sealer's office!
PINKUS	You mean here in the city?
MAYOR	Yes, yes!

MAYOR	Why not?
PINKUS	I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
MAYOR	But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
PINKUS	No, I don't think so.
MAYOR	For heaven's sake, why not?
PINKUS	I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
MAYOR	No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
PINKUS	Yeah?

PINKUS	This puts me in a peculiar hole.
MAYOR	No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
PINKUS	But how do I know...?
MAYOR	Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
PINKUS	Pinkus.
MAYOR	All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.

PINKUS	You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
MAYOR	I'll explain it tomorrow!
PINKUS	Is it hard?
MAYOR	No! It's easy -- it's very easy!

MAYOR	Get out of here!
PINKUS	You can't bribe me!

PINKUS	They wouldn't take it.
MAYOR	You're insane!

PINKUS	Here's the picture of my wife.
MAYOR	A very fine-looking women.
PINKUS	She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
MAYOR	I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --

MURPHY	If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
MCCUE	It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!

MCCUE	Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
MURPHY	Hello, Mollie.

MCCUE	Look out!
MURPHY	Look out where you're aiming, will you?

MURPHY	Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
MCCUE	Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?

MCCUE	Get the cops, somebody.
MURPHY	Come on, fellas.

MURPHY	There she is!
MCCUE	Say, Hildy...

MCCUE	What's your hurry?
MURPHY	We want to see you.

MCCUE	Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
MURPHY	-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --

WILSON	Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
SCHWARTZ	His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.

WILSON	Baldwin -- his name is.
SCHWARTZ	I give that marriage six months.

WILSON	Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
WILSON	Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
SCHWARTZ	What's he want?
WILSON	Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.

SCHWARTZ	The door was locked.
WILSON	She and Mollie were talking.

LOVINGTON	We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
ANDREWS	What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
LOVINGTON	I've put extra men on, all along the way.
ANDREWS	It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
LOVINGTON	No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
ANDREWS	I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 

ANDREWS	OhÂMaryÂ
MARY	Yes, sir?
ANDREWS	How is she?
MARY	WhyÂuhÂshe's all right, sir.
ANDREWS	What's the matter? Anything wrong?
MARY	Oh, no, sir. No different thanÂ
ANDREWS	Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
MARY	Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sirÂshe sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.

ANDREWS	Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
PETER	I found a million dollar babyÂ

PETER	Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and meÂthose things give me a stiff pain.
ANDREWS	You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much ifÂ
PETER	NoÂno. What the deuce do I want toÂ

ANDREWS	Mr. Warne?
PETER	Yeah.
ANDREWS	Come in. Sit down.

ANDREWS	I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
PETER	That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from MiamiÂ  for the love of it?
ANDREWS	Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
PETER	Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
ANDREWS	don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified inÂ
PETER	If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 

PETER	I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
ANDREWS	And this is what you wantÂthirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
PETER	Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
ANDREWS	Yes, I knowÂbutÂ
PETER	What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
ANDREWS	Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
PETER	What ten thousand?
ANDREWS	The reward.
PETER	Who said anything about a reward!
ANDREWS	I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here forÂ
PETER	All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
ANDREWS	You're a peculiar chap.
PETER	We'll go into that some other time.
ANDREWS	The average man would go after the reward. All you seem toÂ
PETER	Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
ANDREWS	You were taken for a buggy ride?
PETER	YeahÂwith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?

ANDREWS	Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
PETER	A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
ANDREWS	That's an evasion.
PETER	She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every dayÂwhether it's coming to her or not.

PETER	If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselfÂlong ago.
ANDREWS	Do you love her?
PETER	A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
ANDREWS	I asked you a question. Do you love her?
PETER	Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.

ANDREWS	What's this about not eating?
ELLIE	I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.

ANDREWS	Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
ELLIE	Why don't you put me in chains?
ANDREWS	I might.
ELLIE	All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!

ANDREWS	Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
ELLIE	I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
ANDREWS	You ought to know why. BecauseÂ
ELLIE	Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. BecauseÂ
ANDREWS	Because marrying that fool King Westley isÂ
ELLIE	You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
ANDREWS	Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?

ELLIE	Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
ANDREWS	If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
ELLIE	You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
ANDREWS	Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
ELLIE	I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.

ELLIE	Where are you taking me?
ANDREWS	South America.
ELLIE	South America!
ANDREWS	We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
ELLIE	You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
ANDREWS	In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
ELLIE	What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
ANDREWS	I'll get it annulled.
ELLIE	You'll never do it! You can't do it!
ANDREWS	I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itÂif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  MmmÂmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
ELLIE	What've you got against King Westley?
ANDREWS	Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
ELLIE	You only met him once .
ANDREWS	That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
ELLIE	You talk as if he were a gigoloÂor something.
ANDREWS	Never mindÂI'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
ELLIE	He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
ANDREWS	You're going to finance him, I suppose.
ELLIE	Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menÂparticularly if you're a shining example.

ELLIE	Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
ANDREWS	He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
ELLIE	You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!

ANDREWS	A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
ELLIE	I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
ANDREWS	Please don't shout.
ELLIE	I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
ANDREWS	Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.

ANDREWS	EllieÂ
ELLIE	Oh, hello, Dad.
ANDREWS	I knocked several times.
ELLIE	Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
ANDREWS	Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
ELLIE	Stunt?
ANDREWS	Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
ELLIE	Oh, yes. I heard.
ANDREWS	Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.

ANDREWS	What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
ELLIE	Nothing. 
ANDREWS	You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mÂI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsÂIÂ  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
ELLIE	Oh, no.
ANDREWS	If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareÂIÂwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
ELLIE	Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.

ANDREWS	I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
ELLIE	On the road.
ANDREWS	Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
ELLIE	No.
ANDREWS	Who is he?
ELLIE	I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
ANDREWS	Well, if it's as serious as all thatÂwe'll move heaven and earth toÂ
ELLIE	It'll do no good.  He despises me.
ANDREWS	Oh, come nowÂ
ELLIE	He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
ANDREWS	Ridiculous!
ELLIE	He doesn't think so much of you either.
ANDREWS	Well!
ELLIE	He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
ANDREWS	Fine man to fall in love with.
ELLIE	He's marvelous!
ANDREWS	Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
ELLIE	I don't know.
ANDREWS	I'd like to have a talk with him.
ELLIE	It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
ANDREWS	Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
ELLIE	No, I'll go through with it.
ANDREWS	But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, whyÂ
ELLIE	It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youÂmade your life so miserableÂand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.

ELLIE	Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
ANDREWS	Is that his name?
ELLIE	Yes. Peter Warne.

ANDREWS	Peter Warne! 
ELLIE	Why? Do you know him? 
ANDREWS	Oh, noÂno.
ELLIE	You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
ANDREWS	Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
ELLIE	Oh, please, DadÂ

ELLIE	Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
ANDREWS	I'm sorry you read it.
ELLIE	Are you going to see him?
ANDREWS	I suppose so.
ELLIE	Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.

ANDREWS	I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
ELLIE	Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.

WESTLEY	might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, IÂ
ANDREWS	Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
WESTLEY	Why should she? After allÂ
ANDREWS	All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementÂthat you've had a talk with meÂthat we've reached an understandingÂthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
WESTLEY	If you really mean it, I will.
ANDREWS	Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married toÂ  Âas long as I can get her back. 

ANDREWS	On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
CAPTAIN	She hasn't had a thing yesterdayÂor today.
ANDREWS	Been sending her meals in regularly?
CAPTAIN	Yessir. She refuses them all.
ANDREWS	Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
CAPTAIN	It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this oneÂ
ANDREWS	Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.

ANDREWS	It's my daughter! Go after her.
CAPTAIN	Lower the boats!

CAPTAIN	What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
ANDREWS	Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
CAPTAIN	What about that diamond wrist watch she had onÂshe can raise some money on that?
ANDREWS	Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsÂall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"

ANDREWS	I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
KING	You've made that quite evidentÂwith all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
ANDREWS	You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.

KING	Why; naturally, IÂ
ANDREWS	Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
KING	You talk as ifÂ
ANDREWS	Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.

KING	Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
ANDREWS	No?  Say, listenÂI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministersÂsome of the most powerful people in the worldÂbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listenÂif you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
KING	What would you like to have me do?
ANDREWS	Sock her!

ANDREWS	Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meÂand maybe we'll be friendsÂ  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
KING	Yes, sir.
ANDREWS	Fine. I'll see you at the reception.

ANDREWS	You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
KING	Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like thatÂ
ANDREWS	Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
KING	Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
ANDREWS	We've done that already.
KING	Yes, of course.

KING	What happened?
ANDREWS	I haven't the slightest idea.

SECRETARY	Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
ANDREWS	Any others?
SECRETARY	Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
ANDREWS	What do they say?
SECRETARY	They're practically all the same, sir. 
ANDREWS	Amateurs!
SECRETARY	They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.

ANDREWS	Don't want to talk toÂdon't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
SECRETARY	But it's King Westley on the phone.
ANDREWS	Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
SECRETARY	There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
ANDREWS	What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling.  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."

PETER	Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
BOY	But the lady saysÂ

BOY	We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
PETER	What happened to your money?
BOY	Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New YorkÂand if we didn't go, she might lose it.
PETER	Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
BOY	I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.

PETER	Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
BOY	Thanks.

PETER	Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
DANKER	Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burnÂ As life's corners I . . .
PETER	All right, let it go.
DANKER	. . . turn."

PETER	No, thanks. We're not hungry.
DANKER	Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
PETER	No.
DANKER	Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . .

DRIVER	Whadda you want!
PETER	If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
DRIVER	Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
PETER	Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.

DRIVER	What do you think you're doing!
PETER	Huh?
DRIVER	The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
PETER	OhÂthe papersÂ

PETER	That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
DRIVER	Hey, whadda you tryin' to doÂkid me?
PETER	Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
DRIVER	What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
PETER	It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
DRIVER	Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
PETER	Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.

DRIVER	Oh, yeah?
PETER	Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
DRIVER	Oh, yeah?
PETER	You win!

PETER	Driver!
DRIVER	Yeah?
PETER	These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
DRIVER	Maybe they doÂand maybe they don't.

DRIVER	That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
PETER	Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
DRIVER	Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.

ELLIE	I beg your pardon!
PETER	Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to youÂ  scram.
ELLIE	Driver!

ELLIE	Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
PETER	Are you talking to me?
ELLIE	Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.

ELLIE	I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
PETER	WellÂof all theÂwellÂ  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.

ELLIE	Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
PETER	Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
ELLIE	What happened?
PETER	That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
ELLIE	What am I going to do now?
PETER	Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
ELLIE	No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
PETER	You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
ELLIE	Why, noÂIÂ  Yes . . . I guess I will.
PETER	I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
ELLIE	No. I'd rather you didn't.
PETER	Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
ELLIE	I don't want it reported!
PETER	Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything thatÂ
ELLIE	See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
PETER	Why, you ungrateful brat!

ELLIE	Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
PETER	Yes.
ELLIE	That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
PETER	I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
ELLIE	No, thank you.  Thank you so much.

PETER	Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
ELLIE	Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?

PETER	What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
ELLIE	What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.

ELLIE	Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night isÂ  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
PETER	You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
ELLIE	My ticket?
PETER	I found it on the seat.
ELLIE	Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.

PETER	You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
ELLIE	What are you talking about?
PETER	Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
ELLIE	Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
PETER	You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
ELLIE	You must have me confused withÂ
PETER	Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.

PETER	Take my adviceÂgrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
ELLIE	I didn't ask for your advice. 
PETER	That's right. You didn't.
ELLIE	You're not going to notify my father, are you?
PETER	What for?
ELLIE	If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
PETER	I never thought of that.
ELLIE	Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
PETER	Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.

ELLIE	If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
PETER	Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.

ELLIE	Here, boy!
PETER	What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
ELLIE	No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.

ELLIE	Of course I do. What do you meanÂ
PETER	Beat it! 
ELLIE	You have your nerve!  Here, boyÂ!

PETER	A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
ELLIE	That's none of your business.
PETER	You're on a budget from now on.

ELLIE	Now, just a minuteÂyou can'tÂ
PETER	Shut up!

PETER	Hey, BratÂ!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
ELLIE	Are you talking to me!
PETER	Yeah. Come onÂwe're stopping here for the night.

ELLIE	Darn clever, these Armenians.
PETER	Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
ELLIE	I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
PETER	Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
ELLIE	Oh, you did? What am I expected to doÂleap for joy?
PETER	I kind of half expected you to thank me.
ELLIE	Your ego is colossal.
PETER	Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?

PETER	Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
ELLIE	Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
PETER	This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
ELLIE	Well, thank you. Thank you very much, butÂ you've been very kind. 
PETER	Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.

ELLIE	That, I suppose, makes everythingÂuhÂquite all right.
PETER	Oh, this?ÂI like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.

PETER	Do you mind joining the Israelites?
ELLIE	You're not really serious about this, are you?
PETER	All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 

PETER	I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstÂthen the tieÂthen the shirtÂnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that IÂ
ELLIE	Smart aleck!

ELLIE	Do you mind putting out the light?
PETER	Not at all. 

ELLIE	Who are you?
PETER	Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
ELLIE	You've got a name, haven't you?
PETER	Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
ELLIE	Peter Warne? I don't like it.
PETER	Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
ELLIE	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
PETER	The pleasure is all mine.

PETER	HereÂ
ELLIE	What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  YouÂyou had it pressed.
PETER	Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
ELLIE	Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
PETER	Listen, BratÂI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.

PETER	You'll find the showersÂand thingsÂright back of the second cottage. 
ELLIE	Outside!
PETER	Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
ELLIE	I can't go out like this.
PETER	Like what?
ELLIE	Like this. I have no robe.
PETER	HereÂtake mine.

ELLIE	Where'd you say the showersÂand thingsÂwere? 
PETER	HeyÂyou're little, aren't you?
ELLIE	Where is the shower?
PETER	Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
ELLIE	I'll find it myself.

PETER	High time you got back.
ELLIE	I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.

ELLIE	Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
PETER	Hurry up and get dressed.
ELLIE	Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
PETER	If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerÂwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.

ELLIE	Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
PETER	I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
ELLIE	Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
PETER	Egg. One eggÂdoughnutsÂblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
ELLIE	Nope. No complaints.
PETER	I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
ELLIE	Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
PETER	What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
ELLIE	Must be the Spring.
PETER	I thought maybeÂuhÂ"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
ELLIE	He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
PETER	Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
ELLIE	Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
PETER	No. No. It's too good a story.
ELLIE	Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
PETER	Yeah?
ELLIE	It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
PETER	Um. You're doing all right.
ELLIE	Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
PETER	One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
ELLIE	It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. IÂI did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
PETER	Santa Claus?
ELLIE	KingÂKing Westley was in it.
PETER	Oh. Is that how you met him?
ELLIE	Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
PETER	Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
ELLIE	Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
PETER	Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
ELLIE	Thanks, professor.
PETER	Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
ELLIE	I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.

PETER	Detectives!
ELLIE	That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
PETER	Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.

PETER	Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
ELLIE	What are you talking about?

ELLIE	Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
PETER	There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
ELLIE	Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
PETER	You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at youÂ
ELLIE	He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!

PETER	Oh, so now I was drunk!
ELLIE	Well, you were!
PETER	I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
ELLIE	Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
PETER	Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
ELLIE	Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.

PETER	Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
ELLIE	You weren't so bad yourself.
PETER	We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughÂwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
ELLIE	Next week "East Lynne."
PETER	After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
ELLIE	How about CinderellaÂor a real hot love story?
PETER	No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
ELLIE	Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
PETER	I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
ELLIE	You always want to run everything.
PETER	If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
ELLIE	I refuse to resign!
PETER	Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.

ELLIE	I better go over and see her.
PETER	Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womanÂa trip like this.
ELLIE	Yes.

ELLIE	Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
PETER	At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
ELLIE	Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
PETER	What's the matter?
ELLIE	I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
PETER	I don't trust that chatterbox.

PETER	First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
ELLIE	Not as long as I'm alive.
PETER	Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
ELLIE	What do you meanÂstarvation?
PETER	It takes money to buy food.
ELLIE	Why, haven't youÂ?
PETER	Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
ELLIE	You didn't give that boy all your money?
PETER	I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
ELLIE	Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
PETER	Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
ELLIE	To New York?
PETER	Yeah.
ELLIE	I'm following you.
PETER	Aren't you afraid of me?
ELLIE	No.
PETER	Okay. Hang on to these.

PETER	I wish you'd stop being playful.
ELLIE	Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
PETER	This isn't "piggy-back."
ELLIE	Of course it is.
PETER	You're crazy.
ELLIE	remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" rideÂ
PETER	And he carried you like this, I suppose.
ELLIE	Yes.
PETER	Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
ELLIE	My uncleÂMother's brotherÂhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
PETER	I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
ELLIE	That's silly.
PETER	To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationÂa warm heartÂand a loving nature.
ELLIE	And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
PETER	Not a one.
ELLIE	You're prejudiced.
PETER	Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instanceÂa natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that heÂ

PETER	This looks like the best spot.
ELLIE	We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
PETER	I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.

ELLIE	PeterÂ
PETER	What?

PETER	If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
ELLIE	Not if you're more hungry than scared.
PETER	All right. You win. Let's forget it.
ELLIE	I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
PETER	Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!

ELLIE	I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
PETER	Well, take them off.
ELLIE	What!
PETER	All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.

PETER	What's the matter?
ELLIE	Oh, PeterÂ 
PETER	What's got into you?
ELLIE	Oh, Peter! I was so scared.

PETER	I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
ELLIE	knowÂbutÂ
PETER	Here. Eat your head off.
ELLIE	I don't want it now.
PETER	Thought you were hungry!
ELLIE	wasÂbutÂ
PETER	But what!
ELLIE	was so scaredÂthat it scaredÂ
PETER	Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.

PETER	Sure.
ELLIE	What?
PETER	Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
ELLIE	Try me.

PETER	I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
ELLIE	Doesn't sound very exciting.

ELLIE	What are you thinking about?
PETER	By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
ELLIE	Really?
PETER	Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
ELLIE	What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
PETER	Hitch-hiking.
ELLIE	Well, you've given me a very good example of the hikingÂ

ELLIE	If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
PETER	No. But I've got a penknife. 
ELLIE	HayÂin my teeth.

PETER	There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
ELLIE	Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
PETER	Carrots.
ELLIE	Raw?
PETER	Uh-huh. Want one?
ELLIE	No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
PETER	You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youÂcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught meÂgoodnight!
ELLIE	I hate the horrid stuff.

PETER	I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
ELLIE	What if nobody stops for us?
PETER	Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
ELLIE	You're an expert, I suppose.
PETER	Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
ELLIE	There's no end to your accomplishments.
PETER	You think it's simple, huh?
ELLIE	Oh, no!
PETER	Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do itÂ

PETER	But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movementÂ  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
ELLIE	Clever.
PETER	Number two is a wider movementÂa smile goes with that oneÂlike this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
ELLIE	You figured that all out yourself, huh?
PETER	Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeÂand hungryÂand everything looks black. It's a long movement like thisÂ  Âwith a follow through.
ELLIE	Amazing.
PETER	Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.

ELLIE	Here comes a car!
PETER	Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.

PETER	Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
ELLIE	When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.

PETER	I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
ELLIE	Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
PETER	You! Don't make me laugh.
ELLIE	You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carÂand I won't use my thumb.

PETER	What're you going to do?
ELLIE	Mind your own business.

ELLIE	You might give me a little credit.
PETER	What for?
ELLIE	I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
PETER	Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
ELLIE	We don't need forty cars.

PETER	What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
ELLIE	Why not? I'm hungry.
PETER	Eat a carrot.
ELLIE	Never!  I'm going in and ask himÂ
PETER	If you do, I'll break your neck.

ELLIE	Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
PETER	Come onÂget in.
ELLIE	Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut onÂ
PETER	Come on! come on! 
ELLIE	What happened?
PETER	Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
ELLIE	What'd you give him for the car?
PETER	A black eye. 

PETER	You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
ELLIE	Darling!

ELLIE	Any luck?
PETER	Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
ELLIE	What about money?
PETER	Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
ELLIE	That's swell!
PETER	I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
ELLIE	I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
PETER	Okay.  Cottage Number Three.

ELLIE	Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
PETER	Yeah, swell.

ELLIE	Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
PETER	Nope.
ELLIE	Why not?

ELLIE	Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
PETER	Me?
ELLIE	Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
PETER	Maybe.  SureÂsure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'dÂ  Yeah, but where you going to find herÂsomebody that's realÂsomebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.

PETER	Better go back to your bed.
ELLIE	I love you.
PETER	You're forgetting you're married.
ELLIE	I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, PeterÂ

ELLIE	I hope you got your money.
PETER	You bet I did.
ELLIE	Congratulations.
PETER	Same to you.
ELLIE	Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
PETER	I would. But I've got a weak stomach.

ELLIE	Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceitedÂ
PETER'S VOICE	Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
ELLIE	A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?

PETER'S VOICE	I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
ELLIE	Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 

PETER'S VOICE	ONEÂTWOÂTHREEÂFOURÂFIVE
ELLIE	Why, you bully. I believe you would.
PETER'S VOICE	ÂsixÂsevenÂeightÂnineÂ
ELLIE	I'm out! I'm out!

ELLIE	Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
PETER'S VOICE	Come here, you little fool!

ELLIE	There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
PETER'S VOICE	WhoÂme?  Want to see me?

ELLIE	No, it isn't. I'm hungry andÂand scared.
PETER'S VOICE	You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
ELLIE	Well, I am.

PETER'S VOICE	Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
ELLIE	Do you know?

PETER'S VOICE	I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bedÂ  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredÂand it's the only thing around.
ELLIE	You sound like a hobo.

ELLIE	Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
PETER'S VOICE	Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 

ELLIE	No harm in your coming to see us.
PETER'S VOICE	Not interested. 
ELLIE	Won't I ever see you again?

KING	How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
ELLIE	Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
KING	You bet we did.
ELLIE	It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
KING	Whatever you say, darling.
ELLIE	I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itÂthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 

ELLIE	Where's the bus to New York?
GUARD	Left twenty minutes ago.
ELLIE	Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busÂI told them to wait!
GUARD	Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.

GUARD	Eight o'clock tonight.
ELLIE	Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
GUARD	Sorry, Miss.

OLD LADY	Here's your ticket, ma'am.
ELLIE	Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
OLD LADY	Oh, thank you. Thank you.
ELLIE	When does the bus leave?
OLD LADY	In about fifteen minutes.
ELLIE	Thank you.

WIFE	What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young ladyÂ
ELLIE	Husband?
WIFE	YesÂif he is your husband.
ELLIE	Isn't he here?
WIFE	No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
ELLIE	Why, he'll be back.
WIFE	Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .

ELLIE	Why, you can't put me out in the middle of theÂ
WIFE	Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
ELLIE	But can't you wait until morningÂ
WIFE	Ain't gonna wait a minute.

ELLIE	Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
WIFE	You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.

SHAPELEY	You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
ELLIE	Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
SHAPELEY	That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!

SHAPELEY	But I don't go in for that kinda stuffÂmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
ELLIE	Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.

SHAPELEY	Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
ELLIE	If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
SHAPELEY	SorryÂI didn't mean toÂ
ELLIE	Get out!
SHAPELEY	Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.

PETER	Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
ELLIE'S VOICE	Oh, excuse me. 

ELLIE'S VOICE	Oh, by the wayÂwhat's your name?
PETER	What's that?

PETER	I've been thinking about you.
ELLIE'S VOICE	Yes?
PETER	You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.

PETER	HeyÂyou not up yet? Come onÂcome on!
ELLIE'S VOICE	What time is it?
PETER	Eight o'clock.

ELLIE'S VOICE	I'm hungry.
PETER	Just your imagination.

FIRST PILOT	The old man's screwy!
SECOND PILOT	What's 'at?
FIRST PILOT	I said, the old man's screwy!
SECOND PILOT	Yeah!
FIRST PILOT	The dame's too smart for him.
SECOND PILOT	How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?

PETER	What's up?
FIRST POLICEMAN	Bridge washed outÂaround Dawson.

FIRST POLICEMAN	Any of your passengers want a place to sleepÂthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
PETER	Yeah? Where?
FIRST POLICEMAN	Up yonder. See the lights?
PETER	Yeah.
FIRST POLICEMAN	That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
PETER	Thanks.

SECRETARY	Mr. GordonÂ
GORDON	Huh?
SECRETARY	Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
GORDON	What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeÂunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 

SECRETARY	Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
GORDON	Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."

GORDON	Collect?
SECRETARY	Yes.
GORDON	Don't accept any more.

GORDON	Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
PETER	That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
GORDON	Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
PETER	That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with thatÂ
GORDON	When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 

GORDON	Get out of here!
PETER	Wait a minute, GordonÂIÂ
GORDON	Get out!

PETER	Joe, listenÂ
GORDON	Don't "Joe" me.
PETER	Okay, Joe. ListenÂyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnÂanytime I ran into a story that looked goodÂI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
GORDON	You mean about the Andrews' kid?
PETER	That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.

GORDON	A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
PETER	Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsÂand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
GORDON	What's the thousand bucks for?
PETER	To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
GORDON	What!
PETER	Never mind . . . ListenÂsuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
GORDON	Huh?
PETER	That she's going to marry somebody else.
GORDON	You're drunk.
PETER	Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
GORDON	If it's on the level.
PETER	Well, I got it, Joe.
GORDON	Who's she gonna marry?
PETER	It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
GORDON	I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
PETER	Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
GORDON	I'd put you there myself.
PETER	Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
GORDON	Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
PETER	I am, Joe.
GORDON	You!
PETER	Yeah.
GORDON	Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
PETER	For heaven's sake, JoeÂstop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.

PETER	I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
GORDON	Well, I'll beÂ
PETER	Listen, PalÂyou've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.  A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?

PETER	Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
GORDON	Okay, pete. 

PETER	'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
GORDON	Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.

PETER	Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
GORDON	Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
PETER	Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
GORDON	Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnÂthen something comes alongÂmesses up the finishÂand there you are.
PETER	Yeah, where am I?
GORDON	When you sober upÂcome in and see me.
PETER	Thanks, Joe.

PETER	All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
MAN	Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
PETER	Listen, manÂI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
MAN	ain't got a hatÂ
PETER	What?
MAN	I ain't got a hat.
PETER	Well, you got one now. ÂCome on, fill 'er up.

WIFE	Funny couple, ain't they?
MAN	Yeah.
WIFE	If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
MAN	They're married all right. I just seen the license.
WIFE	They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
MAN	Yeah?
WIFE	What do you reckon that's for?
MAN	Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
WIFE	A trumpet?
MAN	Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
WIFE	But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
MAN	I dunno.

PETER	You send telegrams here?
OPERATOR	I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews isÂ"  No, do you really?
PETER	Go on. Go on send the telegram.
OPERATOR	How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofÂofÂ
PETER	Mush. Mush.
OPERATOR	Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne. Well, that will be $2.60.
PETER	Send it collect.
OPERATOR	Collect?
PETER	Collect.

WIFE	There you goÂtrustin' people again. How many times did I tell youÂ
OWNER	He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
WIFE	Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
OWNER	Said he was gonna stay a week.
WIFE	Mebbe.
OWNER	Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
WIFE	I don't trust him.

WIFE	I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
OWNER	Who?
WIFE	That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.

WIFE	See that. They're gone!
OWNER	Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
WIFE	Oh!!

WIFE	ThenÂyou'll have to git !
OWNER	Yeah, you'll have to git .

OWNER	Not a minute!
WIFE	Better start gettin' into your clothes.
OWNER	Yeah.
WIFE	Zeke.  Git!
OWNER	Yes, Ma.

SHAPELEY	Well, you're two up on me now. 
PETER	Hey, you!

SHAPELEY	Huh?
PETER	There's a seat over there for you.
SHAPELEY	What's the idea?
PETER	I'd like to sit with myÂuhÂwifeÂif you don't mind. 
SHAPELEY	Wife?
PETER	Yeah. Come onÂcome on!
SHAPELEY	Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'Âyou knowÂto make things pleasant.

SHAPELEY	What's up?
PETER	Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
SHAPELEY	Say, BuddyÂ

SHAPELEY	Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
PETER	Thanks. 
SHAPELEY	If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
PETER	That's right.
SHAPELEY	Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
PETER	YeahÂwouldn't it?
SHAPELEY	It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
PETER	What?
SHAPELEY	I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
PETER	Why?
SHAPELEY	Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
PETER	What's on your mind?
SHAPELEY	Five G'sÂor I crab the works.
PETER	You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.

PETER	Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
SHAPELEY	You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
PETER	I can use a smart guy like you.
SHAPELEY	Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking toÂ
PETER	Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
SHAPELEY	Huh?
PETER	A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
SHAPELEY	WhyÂnoÂ
PETER	That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.

PETER	YeahÂthe "big boy"Âthe Boss of the outfit.
SHAPELEY	You're not kidnapping her, are you?
PETER	What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
SHAPELEY	Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeÂandÂ
PETER	What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
SHAPELEY	But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up withÂ
PETER	Sh-sh-shÂ! Soft pedal, you mug!Âbefore IÂ What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thingÂand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
SHAPELEY	I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
PETER	Yeah ?ÂHow do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
SHAPELEY	You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.

PETER	Where do you live?
SHAPELEY	Orange, New Jersey.
PETER	Got a couple of kids, huh?
SHAPELEY	Yeah. Just babies.
PETER	You love them, don't you?
SHAPELEY	Oh, gee, MisterÂyou wouldn'tÂyou ain't thinkin' aboutÂ
PETER	You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
SHAPELEY	SureÂsureÂI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
PETER	If you don'tÂEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
SHAPELEY	No.
PETER	Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.

SHAPELEY	Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
PETER	Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
SHAPELEY	Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
PETER	Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
SHAPELEY	Sure. Anything you say.

BLEEKER'S MOM	Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
BLEEKER	I don't think so.
BLEEKER'S MOM	You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
BLEEKER	I'm not hungry, oddly.
BLEEKER'S MOM	But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.

BLEEKER'S MOM	Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
BLEEKER	Thanks for the message.
BLEEKER'S MOM	You know how I feel about her.
BLEEKER	You've mentioned it about fifty times.
BLEEKER'S MOM	I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.

JUNO	Hey Bleek.
BLEEKER	Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
JUNO	Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
BLEEKER	Cool.
JUNO	Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
BLEEKER	My mom uses color-safe bleach.
JUNO	Go Carole.  So, guess what?
BLEEKER	I don't know...
JUNO	I'm pregnant.

JUNO	When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
BLEEKER	I'm supposed to be running.
JUNO	I know.

BLEEKER	So, what do you think we should do?
JUNO	I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
BLEEKER	Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
JUNO	So that's cool with you, then?
BLEEKER	Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
JUNO	I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
BLEEKER	Whose idea was it?
JUNO	I'll see you at school, O.K.?

JUNO	Well! Nothing like experimenting.
BLEEKER	I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.

JUNO	Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
BLEEKER	But you copy my work every week.
JUNO	Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
BLEEKER	I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
JUNO	Charisma?
BLEEKER	Or something.

BLEEKER	Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
JUNO	Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
BLEEKER	Okay, cool.
JUNO	I'll try to drop by later.

BLEEKER	What's up?
JUNO	I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
BLEEKER	I miss it too.

BLEEKER	So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
JUNO	Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.

BLEEKER	Really? What are they like?
JUNO	The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
BLEEKER	Is that normal?
JUNO	I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
BLEEKER	Oh. That's a relief.

JUNO	I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
BLEEKER	I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.

JUNO	Jesus, Bleek.
BLEEKER	Well, I do.

BLEEKER	Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
JUNO	Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
BLEEKER	We could get back together too.
JUNO	Were we together?

BLEEKER	Well, we were once. You know, that time.
JUNO	What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
BLEEKER	I don't like Katrina.
JUNO	I totally heard you did.
BLEEKER	I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.

JUNO	Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
BLEEKER	Um, hi?
JUNO	Leah just told me you were going with her.
BLEEKER	Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.

BLEEKER	We're getting a stretch limo.
JUNO	Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
BLEEKER	You're mad. Why are you mad?
JUNO	I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
BLEEKER	Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye. She just looks like that all the time.

BLEEKER	You're being really immature.
JUNO	What?

JUNO	That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
BLEEKER	Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
JUNO	Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
BLEEKER	Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
JUNO	Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
BLEEKER	Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
JUNO	I still have your virginity!
BLEEKER	Oh my God, SHUT UP!
JUNO	What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
BLEEKER	No...
JUNO	Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!

BLEEKER	Wait, let me take that.
JUNO	Huh?
BLEEKER	You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
JUNO	Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?

BLEEKER	Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
JUNO	Yeah. That was me.
BLEEKER	Why?
JUNO	Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
BLEEKER	Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
JUNO	You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
BLEEKER	You know it's okay.
JUNO	Also, I think I'm in love with you.
BLEEKER	What, you mean as friends?
JUNO	No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
BLEEKER	I try really hard, actually...
JUNO	No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
BLEEKER	I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
JUNO	Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
BLEEKER	It does?

BLEEKER	Wizard!
JUNO	I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
BLEEKER	Mine too.
JUNO	Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
BLEEKER	Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
JUNO	That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
BLEEKER	Can we make out now?
JUNO	Okay.

BLEEKER	You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
JUNO	Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
BLEEKER	We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
JUNO	You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
BLEEKER	I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
JUNO	The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.

VIJAY	Hey man.
BLEEKER	Oh, hey Vijay.
VIJAY	Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
BLEEKER	Yup.
VIJAY	Just like our moms and teachers!
BLEEKER	Yup.
VIJAY	Did you hear it's yours?
BLEEKER	Yup.
VIJAY	What a trip, man.
BLEEKER	I don't really know anything about it.
VIJAY	You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
BLEEKER	I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
VIJAY	Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.

BREN	What? I'm not made of stone.
ULTRASOUND TECH	Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?

BREN	Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
ULTRASOUND TECH	I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.

BREN	They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
ULTRASOUND TECH	No... I guess not.
BREN	What is your job title, exactly?
ULTRASOUND TECH	Excuse me?
BREN	I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
ULTRASOUND TECH	I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
BREN	Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
ULTRASOUND TECH	What are you talking about?
BREN	You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?

BREN	Nails? Really?
MAC	No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?

MAC	Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
BREN	I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
MAC	I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
BREN	You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
MAC	Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
BREN	Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
MAC	That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
BREN	Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.

BREN	Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
JUNO	I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.

JUNO	I have no idea how to spit this out.
BREN	Hon, did you get expelled?
JUNO	No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
BREN	Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.

BREN	Oh, God...
JUNO	But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.

JUNO	But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
BREN	Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
JUNO	Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.

JUNO	No.
BREN	Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
JUNO	Cool it.
BREN	First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
JUNO	The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?

BREN	Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
JUNO	I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
BREN	A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
JUNO	They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
BREN	You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
JUNO	I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.

BREN	That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
JUNO	Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
BREN	It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
JUNO	You don't know anything about me!
BREN	I know enough.

JUNO	We don't even have a dog!
BREN	Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
JUNO	Wow, dream big!
BREN	Oh, go fly a kite.

JUNO	Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
BREN	It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
JUNO	You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
BREN	Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.

BREN	Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
JUNO	It really didn't hurt that bad having him.

GERTA	So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
JUNO	I'm a junior.
GERTA	No, I mean in your pregnancy.
JUNO	Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.

JUNO	Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
GERTA	Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
JUNO	Shit, yeah. Close it up.

GUY LAB PARTNER	Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
GIRL LAB PARTNER	No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
GUY LAB PARTNER	You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
GIRL LAB PARTNER	Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
GUY LAB PARTNER	What? My eyes are not lying!
GIRL LAB PARTNER	Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.

GUY LAB PARTNER	Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
GIRL LAB PARTNER	Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
GUY LAB PARTNER	Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.

MARK	This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
JUNO	Geeeerta Rauuuss!

JUNO	No.
MARK	Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.

MARK	So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
JUNO	Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?

JUNO	Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
MARK	Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.

JUNO	Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
MARK	Sorry. I was just getting something.
JUNO	Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
MARK	What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
JUNO	Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
MARK	I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
JUNO	I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.

MARK	Am I supposed to feel happy now?
JUNO	You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
MARK	Viscera?
JUNO	Blood and guts.
MARK	We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.

MARK	Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
JUNO	Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
MARK	Shut up.

JUNO	It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
MARK	What do you play?
JUNO	I rock a Harmony.
MARK	Oh.
JUNO	What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
MARK	Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.

JUNO	What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
MARK	Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
JUNO	Yeah.
MARK	Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
JUNO	When was this, like '96?
MARK	'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
JUNO	Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
MARK	You weren't even alive!

JUNO	Your guitar is named Kimber?
MARK	Yeah.
JUNO	That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.

MARK	Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
JUNO	I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
MARK	No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...

JUNO	Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
MARK	Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
JUNO	Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
MARK	I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.

JUNO	Why aren't you at work?
MARK	I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
JUNO	No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
MARK	No, more commercial stuff.
JUNO	Like what?
MARK	Commercials.
JUNO	Oh.
MARK	Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
JUNO	Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
MARK	I wrote that.
JUNO	You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
MARK	They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.

JUNO	Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
MARK	You're kidding!

JUNO	I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
MARK	Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
JUNO	No, he's the dad.

MARK	Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
JUNO	The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
MARK	Well, it can really only go two ways.
JUNO	That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
MARK	Junk?
JUNO	You know... it's parts...
MARK	I know what junk is.
JUNO	Yeah?
MARK	We definitely want it to have junk.
JUNO	Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.

JUNO	What is it?
MARK	It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
JUNO	I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
MARK	You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.

MARK	Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
JUNO	Hey, I like this.
MARK	This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
JUNO	You don't have to do that.
MARK	It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
JUNO	I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
MARK	Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.

JUNO	The Wizard of Gore?
MARK	Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
JUNO	Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.

MARK	Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
JUNO	Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.

JUNO	This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
MARK	Here's to dovetailing interests.

JUNO	So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
MARK	Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
JUNO	Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
MARK	God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
JUNO	My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
MARK	That suits you.
JUNO	Uh, thanks.
MARK	You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
JUNO	I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
MARK	You're something else.

MARK	Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
JUNO	Why? What the big deal?
MARK	Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
JUNO	I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.

MARK	Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
JUNO	I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.

JUNO	Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
MARK	Yeah. Mall madness, huh?

MARK	I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
JUNO	Why?

MARK	Cold feet.
JUNO	You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.

MARK	Hello?
JUNO	So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.

MARK	Oh really? What's the verdict?
JUNO	I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
MARK	Cute?
JUNO	Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
MARK	I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
JUNO	Consider it your musical education.
MARK	I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
JUNO	Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
MARK	Go learn something.

MARK	Wow. That shirt is working hard.
JUNO	Is Vanessa here?
MARK	Nope. We're safe.

JUNO	Cool.
MARK	Come on, I have something for you.

JUNO	Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
MARK	Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
JUNO	Oh God, you're one of those guys...
MARK	You're gonna like this, I promise.

JUNO	Most Fruitful Yuki? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
MARK	Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.

JUNO	Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
MARK	Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.

JUNO	What?
MARK	I actually know this one.
JUNO	You do?
MARK	Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
JUNO	That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
MARK	Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
JUNO	Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!

JUNO	Oh, okay. Like this.
MARK	You've never been to a dance, have you?
JUNO	Only squares and nerds go to dances.
MARK	What are you?
JUNO	I don't know.

MARK	I'm leaving Vanessa.
JUNO	What?
MARK	It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...

JUNO	No.
MARK	No?
JUNO	No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
MARK	What's the matter?
JUNO	This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!

MARK	But I thought you'd be cool if...
JUNO	I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
MARK	A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
JUNO	But you're old!
MARK	I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
JUNO	I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
MARK	This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
JUNO	Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
MARK	That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
JUNO	Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.

JUNO	Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
MARK	God, you're so young.
JUNO	Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!

JUNO	Uh, hi Su-Chin.
SU-CHIN	Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
JUNO	Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
SU-CHIN	No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
JUNO	You should try Adderall.
SU-CHIN	No thanks. I'm off pills.
JUNO	Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
SU-CHIN	I heard that was you.
JUNO	Well, it was nice seeing you.

SU-CHIN	Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
JUNO	Really? Fingernails?

VANESSA	Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
JUNO	Vanessa, right?

VANESSA	Can I take your coats?
JUNO	Sure.

JUNO	Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
VANESSA	You found us in the Penny Saver?

VANESSA	I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
JUNO	A Maker's Mark, please. Up.

VANESSA	Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
JUNO	Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
VANESSA	The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
JUNO	Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
VANESSA	I think pregnancy is beautiful.
JUNO	Well, you're lucky it's not you.

VANESSA	Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
JUNO	Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
VANESSA	Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
JUNO	Room with a toilet, got it.

JUNO	Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
VANESSA	So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?

JUNO	I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
VANESSA	Oh really?
JUNO	Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?

VANESSA	Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
JUNO	Nothing...
VANESSA	Then what's going on?
JUNO	I went to the doctor today.

VANESSA	Is the baby okay?
JUNO	Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...

VANESSA	What...
JUNO	This is the baby. Your baby.

VANESSA	Oh my God...
JUNO	Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
VANESSA	Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.

VANESSA	Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
JUNO	I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.

VANESSA	Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
JUNO	What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
VANESSA	No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.

VANESSA	Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
JUNO	Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.

JUNO	Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
VANESSA	Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.

VANESSA	No...
JUNO	Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
VANESSA	Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
JUNO	Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!

VANESSA	Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
JUNO	Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.

VANESSA	Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
JUNO	Elbow.
VANESSA	Wow! It's magical.

VANESSA	Juno? What's going on?
JUNO	Nothing.

VANESSA	Mark? Why is Juno crying?
JUNO	I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.

JUNO	Hi. I'm here for the big show?
PUNK RECEPTIONIST	Your name, please?
JUNO	Juno MacGuff.

PUNK RECEPTIONIST	Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
JUNO	No thank you. I'm off sex.
PUNK RECEPTIONIST	My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
JUNO	Congrats.

MAC	You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
JUNO	My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...

MAC	So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
JUNO	Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?

MAC	Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
JUNO	No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
MAC	What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?

JUNO	They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
MAC	You're pregnant?
JUNO	I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!

MAC	Who is the kid?
JUNO	The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.

JUNO	What?
MAC	Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!

MAC	Okay, this is no laughing matter.
JUNO	No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.

MAC	Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
JUNO	Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.

MAC	Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
JUNO	Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!

MAC	I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
JUNO	I have no idea what kind of girl I am.

MAC	She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
JUNO	I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.

MAC	Excuse me?
JUNO	Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.

JUNO	Hi Dad.
MAC	Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
JUNO	Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
MAC	Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
JUNO	Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
MAC	No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
JUNO	Yeah, she does.
MAC	You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
JUNO	I'm losing my faith in humanity.
MAC	Think you can narrow it down for me.
JUNO	I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
MAC	You mean like couples?
JUNO	Yeah, like people in love.
MAC	Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
JUNO	Dad, no!
MAC	Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
JUNO	Please stop now.
MAC	Tore up from the floor up?
JUNO	Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
MAC	It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.

JUNO	I sort of already have.
MAC	Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.

MAC	What?!
JUNO	Either I just pissed my pants or...
MAC	Or...
JUNO	Thundercats are go!

ROLLO	Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
JUNO	I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.

ROLLO	Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
JUNO	Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.

ROLLO	Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
JUNO	Jesus, I didn't say it was.
ROLLO	Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride!  These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.

ROLLO	So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
JUNO	I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.

LEAH	Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
JUNO	I am a suicide risk.
LEAH	Is this Juno?
JUNO	No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
LEAH	Only the one in my pants.
JUNO	Dude, I'm pregnant.
LEAH	Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
JUNO	It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
LEAH	How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
JUNO	I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
LEAH	Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
JUNO	Unfortunately, yes.
LEAH	Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
JUNO	That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
LEAH	Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
JUNO	I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
LEAH	Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
JUNO	Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.

LEAH	Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
JUNO	That is sick, man.

LEAH	So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
JUNO	Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
LEAH	When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
JUNO	Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.

LEAH	Aha! You love him.
JUNO	It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.

LEAH	So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
JUNO	It was magnificent, man!

LEAH	What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
JUNO	I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
LEAH	Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
JUNO	I'm staying pregnant, Le.
LEAH	Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
JUNO	What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
LEAH	But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
JUNO	I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
LEAH	Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
JUNO	Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.

LEAH	Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
JUNO	There are ads? For parents?
LEAH	Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
JUNO	Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.

JUNO	The Penny Saver sucks.
LEAH	Yeah, but it sucks for free.

LEAH	Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
JUNO	There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
LEAH	You're not listening to me.
JUNO	No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
LEAH	What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
JUNO	I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
LEAH	All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
JUNO	Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
LEAH	Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.

LEAH	Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
JUNO	I'm pregnant.

LEAH	Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
JUNO	Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
LEAH	Touche.
JUNO	It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.

LEAH	Aw, please Junebug?
JUNO	No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.

JUNO	How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
LEAH	Or stage parents!

LEAH	Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
JUNO	Share the love, Tits!

JUNO	Hly shht!
LEAH	What?

JUNO	That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
LEAH	Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

LEAH	No way! She's pretty.
JUNO	You sound shocked or something.
LEAH	I just thought she'd look really old in real life.

LEAH	She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
JUNO	Right, seriously.

JUNO	I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
LEAH	God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

LEAH	God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
JUNO	Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
LEAH	I wish my funbags would get bigger.
JUNO	Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
LEAH	Hot!

JUNO	God, why is everyone always staring at me?
LEAH	Well, you are kind of... convex.

JUNO	Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
LEAH	I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
JUNO	Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
LEAH	Keith's hot.
JUNO	Eww, he's all beardy!

LEAH	Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
JUNO	Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
LEAH	He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
JUNO	Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
LEAH	Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
JUNO	There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
LEAH	I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
JUNO	Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
LEAH	Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
JUNO	I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
LEAH	Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
JUNO	Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.

MAC	Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
VANESSA	Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.

MAC	You don't say.
VANESSA	Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
MAC	Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
VANESSA	Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.

MAC	So. What's that thing?
VANESSA	A Pilates machine?
MAC	What do you make with that?
VANESSA	You don't make anything. It's for exercising.

MARK	Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
VANESSA	Are you looking for any other compensation?

VANESSA	You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
MARK	Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
VANESSA	I want to be a mommy so badly!

VANESSA	You guys are playing music?
MARK	Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.

VANESSA	What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
MARK	They're yellow.
VANESSA	Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
MARK	Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
VANESSA	I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
MARK	Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
VANESSA	What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
MARK	Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
VANESSA	You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
MARK	I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
VANESSA	And I disagree.

VANESSA	That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
MARK	Hm.
VANESSA	Can you see it?

VANESSA	Juno, what's the matter?
MARK	She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.

VANESSA	What did you do?
MARK	I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
VANESSA	What?
MARK	Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
VANESSA	What are you referring to?

MARK	I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
VANESSA	Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
MARK	I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.

VANESSA	Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
MARK	It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
VANESSA	She answered our prayers.
MARK	Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.

VANESSA	What would be a good time for you?
MARK	I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
VANESSA	Like what? Be a rock star?
MARK	Don't mock me.

MARK	I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
VANESSA	No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.

VANESSA	We're actually, finally doing this?
MARK	Looks like it, yeah.
VANESSA	Have you found a place to stay?
MARK	Yeah, downtown.
VANESSA	A hotel?
MARK	It's a loft.
VANESSA	Aren't you the cool guy?

DAGO RED	There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
HAWKEYE	I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.

HAWKEYE	We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
DAGO RED	Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski Â Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.

HAWKEYE	How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
DAGO RED	You talked to Walt?
HAWKEYE	He's parted his moorings.

DAGO RED	What do you want me to do?
HAWKEYE	Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
DAGO RED	I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
HAWKEYE	What is, Red, the intention or the act?
DAGO RED	I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
HAWKEYE	Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.

DAGO RED	Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
HAWKEYE	He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.

DAGO RED	What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
HAWKEYE	Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.

DUKE	Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
HENRY	Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
DUKE	Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
HENRY	You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
DUKE	They give you copies to burn.

HENRY	Good. You've both been working close to the front.
DUKE	Never this close.
HENRY	They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.

HENRY	I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
DUKE	Just one for a start.

DUKE	Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
HENRY	I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...

HENRY	Yes, O'Reilly?
DUKE	How you, Radar?

HENRY	You boys'll have to go to work early.
DUKE	You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.

DUKE	What are you going to do with him?
HENRY	Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
DUKE	Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!

HENRY	Stop him! Stop that man!
DUKE	Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.

DUKE	Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
TRAPPER	Home.
DUKE	I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
TRAPPER	That's right.
DUKE	Where?
TRAPPER	Hospital.
DUKE	Which hospital?
TRAPPER	Back home.
DUKE	Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
TRAPPER	No.  Or why you should.

TRAPPER	Don't you use olives?
DUKE	Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.

DUKE	How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
TRAPPER	Pour one for Painless.

TRAPPER	Miss you, Walt.
DUKE	He said it for us all, Walt.

DUKE	Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
TRAPPER	Look at that right eye.
DUKE	Epidural hematoma?
TRAPPER	I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
DUKE	Not enough to be a pro.

TRAPPER	She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
DUKE	I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.

TRAPPER	Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
DUKE	There's only one way.

TRAPPER	It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
DUKE	Or her figger.

TRAPPER	Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
DUKE	You really think we hurt him that bad?
TRAPPER	Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.

DUKE	Y'all mind the store.
TRAPPER	Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.

HO-JON	Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
DUKE	Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
HO-JON	I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
DUKE	Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?

DUKE	I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
HO-JON	That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.

HO-JON	You Â must Â open Â me Â up Â again?
DUKE	No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.

FRANK	Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
DUKE	What the hell's going on here?
FRANK	This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
DUKE	Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.

DUKE	But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
FRANK	I don't drink intoxicants.

FRANK	I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
DUKE	The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
FRANK	Wisconsin.
DUKE	Same general idea.

FRANK	So long, Ho-Jon.
DUKE	You make a mean martini, kid.

DUKE	Us. Lead us not into...
FRANK	...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...

DUKE	What?
SPEARCHUCKER	When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.

SPEARCHUCKER	We got to stop them right here.
DUKE	And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.

SPEARCHUCKER	You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
DUKE	What's there to do? You found the sliver.
SPEARCHUCKER	There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
DUKE	Perfectionist.

HAWKEYE	My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
DUKE	Duke Forrest.

DUKE	You got directions?
HAWKEYE	Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
DUKE	I got some.

HAWKEYE	Make it yourself, or is it real?
DUKE	Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
HAWKEYE	Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
DUKE	Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
HAWKEYE	Crabapple Cove. Maine.
DUKE	Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
HAWKEYE	Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
DUKE	C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
HAWKEYE	We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.

DUKE	What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
HAWKEYE	Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!

HAWKEYE	Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore Â  House. You in the market Duke?
DUKE	I done my shopping in Seoul last night.

HAWKEYE	Well, there it is. Jesus!
DUKE	The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.

DUKE	What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
HAWKEYE	Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.

HAWKEYE	Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
DUKE	That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.

DUKE	Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
HAWKEYE	Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
DUKE	And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.

HAWKEYE	This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
DUKE	Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?

DUKE	Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
HAWKEYE	He can't take much more time on the table.
DUKE	So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.

HAWKEYE	Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
DUKE	We been had.

HAWKEYE	We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
DUKE	We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.

DUKE	No, Hawkeye just said it all.
HAWKEYE	Except we forgot one other small thing.
DUKE	What's that?
HAWKEYE	The chest-cutter.
DUKE	Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
HAWKEYE	This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
DUKE	And it's the ninth inning.

HAWKEYE	Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
DUKE	Sixteen times.
HAWKEYE	We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...

DUKE	Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
HAWKEYE	You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
DUKE	Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.

DUKE	Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
HAWKEYE	Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.

HAWKEYE	This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
DUKE	Call Dago Red.

DUKE	And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
HAWKEYE	Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
DUKE	What do you think, Trapper?

DUKE	Y'all just act natural.
HAWKEYE	Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.

DUKE	That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
HAWKEYE	This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.

DUKE	Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
HAWKEYE	Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?

HAWKEYE	Never mind. Forget it.
DUKE	A native is someone who is born in a particular place.

HAWKEYE	When will he be able to write?
DUKE	What's he got to write, for God's sake?
HAWKEYE	An application to Androscoggin College.

HAWKEYE	I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
DUKE	You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
HAWKEYE	How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
DUKE	I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
HAWKEYE	You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.

DUKE	Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
HAWKEYE	All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...

DUKE	Never heard of him.
HAWKEYE	Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
DUKE	The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?

DUKE	How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
HAWKEYE	I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.

DUKE	Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
HAWKEYE	Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.

DUKE	Look at the size of those two beasts.
HAWKEYE	I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.

HAWKEYE	Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
DUKE	Yeah, if I can.

DUKE	Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
HAWKEYE	Same here. You can retire my number.

HAWKEYE	Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
DUKE	When?
HAWKEYE	Any time. Whenever we want.
DUKE	Be right with you.

HAWKEYE	There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
DUKE	We could steal one of the choppers.
HAWKEYE	I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.

DUKE	I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
HAWKEYE	We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
DUKE	But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
HAWKEYE	Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?

DUKE	Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
HAWKEYE	Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.

DUKE	Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
HAWKEYE	Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.

HOT LIPS	There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
FRANK	No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
HOT LIPS	I have a tent to myself.
FRANK	People will talk.
HOT LIPS	I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.

HOT LIPS	I think it's a marvelous letter.
FRANK	We're a good team.
HOT LIPS	We think the same way.
FRANK	It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
HOT LIPS	Ravenous. What about you?
FRANK	Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
HOT LIPS	Anyway, we want to get this letter off.

FRANK	Godless buffoons, all of them.
HOT LIPS	It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
FRANK	Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
HOT LIPS	And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.

HOT LIPS	Frank...
FRANK	Don't stop now! Please...

HOT LIPS	Wait a second...
FRANK	I can't... couldn't.

FRANK	Is that liquor?
HAWKEYE	Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?

FRANK	Give us this day our daily...
HAWKEYE	You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
FRANK	...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...

FRANK	...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
HAWKEYE	Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
FRANK	...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.

HAWKEYE	I was just asking...
FRANK	Shut up or I'll tear you apart.

GENERAL HAMMOND	If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
HENRY	A football game?
GENERAL HAMMOND	Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
HENRY	But what about Major Houlihan?
GENERAL HAMMOND	You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
HENRY	N-n-no thanks, G-General.

GENERAL HAMMOND	The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
HENRY	You willing to b-back that up with odds?
GENERAL HAMMOND	Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.

HAWKEYE	Gimme three.
GENERAL HAMMOND	At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
HAWKEYE	You betcher ass, Dad.
GENERAL HAMMOND	What?

GENERAL HAMMOND	Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
HAWKEYE	You betcher ass, General.

HAWKEYE	I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
GENERAL HAMMOND	I want to talk to you, Pierce.
HAWKEYE	There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.

HAWKEYE	Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
GENERAL HAMMOND	Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
HAWKEYE	Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
GENERAL HAMMOND	Right.
HAWKEYE	So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.

HAWKEYE	And there it is.
GENERAL HAMMOND	I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
HAWKEYE	Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.

HAWKEYE	Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
GENERAL HAMMOND	We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
HAWKEYE	I think I heard about that.
GENERAL HAMMOND	Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
HAWKEYE	Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
GENERAL HAMMOND	I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.

HAWKEYE	I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
RADAR	Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
HAWKEYE	Also I'm curious whether she's a moaner or...

RADAR	A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
HAWKEYE	I though you said we didn't have a drop.
RADAR	I found a doner.

HAWKEYE	Radar!
RADAR	All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.

HAWKEYE	What for?
MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
HAWKEYE	Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	C-A-M-E-M...?
HAWKEYE	B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.

HAWKEYE	I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
TRAPPER	If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?

HAWKEYE	That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
TRAPPER	I like an olive.

TRAPPER	Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
HAWKEYE	He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?

TRAPPER	What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
HAWKEYE	Part of him. Painless is the owner and operator of the Pride of Hamtrack. That's where he comes from... Hamtrack, Michigan.

TRAPPER	...But I turned in my knee pads.
HAWKEYE	Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.

TRAPPER	Black capsule.
HAWKEYE	The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.

TRAPPER	We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
HAWKEYE	The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.

TRAPPER	Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
HAWKEYE	An eternal damnation.

TRAPPER	We stand behind all our work.
HAWKEYE	You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.

TRAPPER	It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
HAWKEYE	And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.

HAWKEYE	Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
TRAPPER	No, no, that one.
HAWKEYE	Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.

HAWKEYE	I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
TRAPPER	As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.

HAWKEYE	I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
TRAPPER	'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.

HAWKEYE	Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
TRAPPER	But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?

TRAPPER	But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
HAWKEYE	So let's haul ass, Sergeant.

TRAPPER	Look.
HAWKEYE	Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.

HAWKEYE	Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
TRAPPER	Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?

HAWKEYE	Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
TRAPPER	Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
HAWKEYE	Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.

HAWKEYE	Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
TRAPPER	And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
HAWKEYE	When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.

HAWKEYE	Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
TRAPPER	I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
HAWKEYE	What's the age of consent in this country?

HAWKEYE	Is he out?
TRAPPER	Like the Rock of Gibraltar.

TRAPPER	Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
HAWKEYE	Radar!

HAWKEYE	For you, Trapper.
TRAPPER	Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?

HAWKEYE	It's in pretty deep.
TRAPPER	Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.

HAWKEYE	Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
TRAPPER	Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!

HAWKEYE	If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
TRAPPER	How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
HAWKEYE	Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
TRAPPER	We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
HAWKEYE	Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
TRAPPER	You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
HAWKEYE	If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.

HAWKEYE	I don't feel anything.
TRAPPER	Oh, Jesus.

TRAPPER	I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
HAWKEYE	I don't get it.
TRAPPER	It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
HAWKEYE	What do we do?
TRAPPER	We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
HAWKEYE	Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
TRAPPER	Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.

TRAPPER	It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
HAWKEYE	They're coming.

TRAPPER	But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
HAWKEYE	We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.

TRAPPER	He only lasted one season.
HAWKEYE	On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.

TRAPPER	So what makes you think he'll play for us?
HAWKEYE	We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
TRAPPER	Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
HAWKEYE	He can move in here with us.

HAWKEYE	But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
TRAPPER	Not necessarily.

HOT LIPS	Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
HAWKEYE	Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?

HOT LIPS	Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
HAWKEYE	I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
HOT LIPS	All of them?
HAWKEYE	That's right. We work well together.
HOT LIPS	Major Burns is far from satisfied.
HAWKEYE	That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
HOT LIPS	On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
HAWKEYE	And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
HOT LIPS	I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
HAWKEYE	It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
HOT LIPS	That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
HAWKEYE	Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
HOT LIPS	I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
HAWKEYE	Sister, if I knew the answer to that I sure as hell wouldn't be here.

HAWKEYE	Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute.  You can see them too, if you want.
HOT LIPS	No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.

HAWKEYE	Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
SPEARCHUCKER	Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
HAWKEYE	I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.

HAWKEYE	The bastards outconned us.
SPEARCHUCKER	I think we could still have a chance.
HAWKEYE	If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
SPEARCHUCKER	No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.

HAWKEYE	What's the matter?
SPEARCHUCKER	We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.

HAWKEYE	See you.
SPEARCHUCKER	It's possible
HAWKEYE	Hang in there.

LIEUTENANT DISH	Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
HAWKEYE	There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...

LIEUTENANT DISH	Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
HAWKEYE	No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
LIEUTENANT DISH	How did you get called that?
HAWKEYE	'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.

LIEUTENANT DISH	You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
HAWKEYE	It isn't always this rough?
LIEUTENANT DISH	Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
HAWKEYE	They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
LIEUTENANT DISH	Our minds?
HAWKEYE	For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
LIEUTENANT DISH	You're an attractive man.
HAWKEYE	You have a certain modest charm yourself.
LIEUTENANT DISH	But I'm married.
HAWKEYE	Something else we have in common.
LIEUTENANT DISH	Very happily married.
HAWKEYE	Same here.
LIEUTENANT DISH	And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
HAWKEYE	It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
LIEUTENANT DISH	I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
HAWKEYE	Ayuh.
LIEUTENANT DISH	You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
HAWKEYE	Of course not.
LIEUTENANT DISH	It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
HAWKEYE	Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
LIEUTENANT DISH	But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.

LIEUTENANT DISH	Even if I weren't.
HAWKEYE	Maria...

LIEUTENANT DISH	I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
HAWKEYE	You're leaving tomorrow?
LIEUTENANT DISH	In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
HAWKEYE	That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
LIEUTENANT DISH	Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
HAWKEYE	Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
LIEUTENANT DISH	You're on his side all of the sudden?
HAWKEYE	A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
LIEUTENANT DISH	How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
HAWKEYE	It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
LIEUTENANT DISH	You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.

LIEUTENANT DISH	Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
HAWKEYE	I didn't mean with me.

LIEUTENANT DISH	You're asking for somebody else?
HAWKEYE	It happens to be a matter of life and death.
LIEUTENANT DISH	A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
HAWKEYE	Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.

HAWKEYE	He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
LIEUTENANT DISH	You think he won't.
HAWKEYE	What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
LIEUTENANT DISH	I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
HAWKEYE	It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
LIEUTENANT DISH	I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
HAWKEYE	In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.

KOREAN DOCTOR	You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
HAWKEYE	Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
KOREAN DOCTOR	I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
HAWKEYE	I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
KOREAN DOCTOR	At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
HAWKEYE	Why would he do that?
KOREAN DOCTOR	Who is knowing? But the drug I have find in his urine is solving all mysteries. By tomorrow will be gone his fast heart and high blood pressure. So I think maybe you will like to tell him goodbye. Okay?

HAWKEYE	Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
LIEUTENANT SCORCH	Second pint.
HAWKEYE	Duke...

LIEUTENANT SCORCH	It was really nice of you to take me along.
HAWKEYE	I didn't have much choice.
LIEUTENANT SCORCH	You really say the cutest things.
HAWKEYE	Yeah!

SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
HAWKEYE	Excuse me, Sergeant.
SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Yes, Reverend?
HAWKEYE	What do you want with those two medical officers?
SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.

HAWKEYE	Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
HAWKEYE	They missed the boat.
SECOND MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT	Thanks.
HAWKEYE	Glad to help.

HAWKEYE	He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
ME LAY	Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.

ME LAY	The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
HAWKEYE	The one and only.
ME LAY	Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?

HAWKEYE	You don't go after the local scrunch?
ME LAY	I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.

HAWKEYE	What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
ME LAY	That's about the only thing I don't do Â that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.

HAWKEYE	Why can't you look at him?
ME LAY	I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
HAWKEYE	What's the story?
ME LAY	Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
HAWKEYE	What's wrong with him?
ME LAY	Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.

ME LAY	He's coming to.
HAWKEYE	Let's get his clothes off quick.

PAINLESS	Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
HAWKEYE	Poker sounds great. When do you play?

PAINLESS	If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
HAWKEYE	Tell me the whole story, Walt.
PAINLESS	There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
HAWKEYE	There's only one worth noticing.
PAINLESS	You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...

PAINLESS	But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
HAWKEYE	What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
PAINLESS	Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!

HAWKEYE	Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
PAINLESS	Homosexuality.

PAINLESS	Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
HAWKEYE	You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
PAINLESS	No, never in the slightest.
HAWKEYE	Just in dreams?
PAINLESS	Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
HAWKEYE	That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
PAINLESS	But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
HAWKEYE	You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
PAINLESS	No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.

PAINLESS	That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
HAWKEYE	Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.

HAWKEYE	In the direction you want to go.
PAINLESS	You guys got any black capsules?

PAINLESS	How much time do I have?
HAWKEYE	Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
PAINLESS	I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?

HAWKEYE	Morning Painless. How they goin'?
PAINLESS	Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.

HO-JON	Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
HAWKEYE	You can cut the bow.
HO-JON	I have not understood what you means.
HAWKEYE	That. It's out of the act.

HO-JON	Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
HAWKEYE	Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.

HAWKEYE	Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
HO-JON	Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.

HAWKEYE	There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
HO-JON	He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!

HO-JON	And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
HAWKEYE	I don't think so either.

HAWKEYE	Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
HO-JON	I Â wouldn't Â wish Â it Â on Â a Â maneating Â shark.

HENRY	I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
HAWKEYE	Nope, we're assigned heah.

HAWKEYE	The blonde dish.
HENRY	If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
HAWKEYE	Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
HENRY	They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.

HENRY	You don't aim to cause any trouble Â But?
HAWKEYE	But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
HENRY	Your tent?

HAWKEYE	We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
HENRY	That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?

HAWKEYE	You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
HENRY	Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.

HAWKEYE	About that chest-cutter...
HENRY	I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
HAWKEYE	We don't want any more than that.  Right now.

HAWKEYE	Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
HENRY	There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.

HENRY	I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
HAWKEYE	Christ. All of a sudden it's West Point.

HAWKEYE	First decent idea you've had in a month.
HENRY	Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.

HENRY	Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
HAWKEYE	You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.

HENRY	It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
HAWKEYE	It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.

HENRY	What's going on? Who started this?
TRAPPER	You mean who hit who?
HENRY	Yes, that's what I mean.
TRAPPER	I did. First and only blow. So far.

TRAPPER	If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
HENRY	I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.

HENRY	What's wrong with you?
TRAPPER	I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.

HENRY	We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
TRAPPER	I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.

HENRY	O'Reilly!
RADAR	Yes, sir?
HENRY	Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
RADAR	One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
HENRY	Yes, dammit, and...

HENRY	O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
RADAR	I'm afraid so, Colonel.
HENRY	We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
RADAR	Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?

RADAR	Sir?
HENRY	Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
RADAR	Sir?
HENRY	Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
RADAR	To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
HENRY	Stop that, O'Rielly!
RADAR	Sir?
HENRY	Oh, get out of here!
RADAR	Yes, Colonel.

RADAR	Good morning, Colonel.
HENRY	Morning, Radar. How were things?
RADAR	Splendid, sir. No problems.
HENRY	Morning, Captain.

HENRY	Can you make out what they're talking about?
RADAR	I can try, sir.

RADAR	Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
HENRY	Damn.
RADAR	And another one, but it's from the south.  There.

SPEARCHUCKER	If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
HENRY	The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
SPEARCHUCKER	In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.

HENRY	Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
SPEARCHUCKER	I used to throw the javelin.

SPEARCHUCKER	Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
HENRY	They can't do that to me!

HENRY	Well, there's one big satisfaction.
SPEARCHUCKER	What's that, Henry?
HENRY	I out-coached that General Hammond.

TRAPPER	Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
HOT LIPS	Good morning.

TRAPPER	This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
HOT LIPS	Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
TRAPPER	Yeah?
HOT LIPS	It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
TRAPPER	Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.

TRAPPER	Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
ME LAY	May I have the surgeon's name, please?

TRAPPER	Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
ME LAY	I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.

TRAPPER	What's the bastard really like?
ME LAY	Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
TRAPPER	That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?

TRAPPER	Never mind.
ME LAY	The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
TRAPPER	Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.

TRAPPER	Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
ME LAY	No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
TRAPPER	How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.

ME LAY	Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
TRAPPER	Now?

TRAPPER	We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
ME LAY	But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.

TRAPPER	How is he?
UGLY JOHN	Nice.
TRAPPER	Arterial silk.

TRAPPER	Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
UGLY JOHN	Nice.
TRAPPER	Boys, we're home free.

UGLY JOHN	As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
TRAPPER	It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.

JOE	You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
ANN	A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperÂand forty heads are chopped off!
JOE	Did you get it, too?
ANN	Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
JOE	Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
ANN	Yeah. Lavender and old lace!

ANN	Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
JOHN	Yeah, maybe.

ANN	Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterÂand stick by it?
JOHN	Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.

JOHN	Huh?
ANN	Are you all right?
JOHN	Yeah, I'm all right.

JOHN	Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
ANN	He likes you well enough to stick around.
JOHN	Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.

JOHN	Action?
ANN	Um-hum.

ANN	Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
JOHN	Can't. I'm feeling too good.
ANN	Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
JOHN	With all of it?
ANN	Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
JOHN	Oh, crabby guy, huh?

ANN	Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
JOHN	Well, all those guys in the bleachers thinkÂ
ANN	Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
JOHN	Against what?
ANN	Against anything. Just protest.
JOHN	You got me.
ANN	Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
JOHN	Oh, yuh did, huh?
ANN	Yes!
JOHN	Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- belliedÂ
ANN	Grab it, Eddie, grab it!

ANN	Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
JOHN	No.
ANN	Of course not. He wouldn't be.
JOHN	Who?
ANN	John Doe. The one in there. 

JOHN	Who?
ANN	John Doe, the one in the speech.
JOHN	Oh. Yeah.
ANN	You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.

JOHN	Say, he's a friend of mine.
ANN	Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.

ANN	Hello, John.
JOHN	Hello.

ANN	Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's goingÂ
JOHN	John Doe Clubs? What for?
ANN	Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
JOHN	I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
ANN	Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
JOHN	Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
ANN	Uh-huh . . .
JOHN	Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
ANN	Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
JOHN	Me?
ANN	Uh-huh.

JOHN	Can I help you pack?
ANN	No, thank you.

JOHN	Do you care if I sit down out here?
ANN	No.

JOHN	You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
ANN	About me?
JOHN	Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.

JOHN	Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
ANN	Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
JOHN	No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.

ANN	Ted Sheldon.
JOHN	Yeah, that's the one.

JOHN	But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
ANN	You were? I thought you were chasing me?
JOHN	Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
ANN	I guess so. Then what happened?
JOHN	Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.

JOHN	How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
ANN	I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
JOHN	Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
ANN	Look, JohnÂwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just aÂ
JOHN	Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, butÂthere you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.

JOHN	Did you write this?
ANN	Yes, I did, John. But IÂI had no idea what was going on.
JOHN	You didn't?

JOHN	Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
ANN	John, please let me go with you! Please, John!

D. B.	. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
ANN	Yes, sir.
D. B.	How much money do you get?
ANN	Thirty dollars.
D. B.	Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
ANN	Money.
D. B.	Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
ANN	Oh, I'm sure I can.
D. B.	Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
ANN	A hundred dollars!
D. B.	That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.

D. B.	Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, erÂ  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
ANN	How do you do.

ANN	Thank you very much for everything.
D. B.	And, Miss MitchellÂI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
ANN	Yes, sir.

ANN	Better let me talk to him.
D. B.	All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.

ANN	Oh, somebody else sitting there?
D. B.	No, no, noÂthat's your seat.

ANN	Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellÂI don't quite know what to say . . .
D. B.	Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.

ANN	Oh!
D. B.	Go ahead, open it, open it.

D. B.	Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
ANN	A third party?
D. B.	Yes. The John Doe Party.

D. B.	Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
ANN	Mr. D. B. Norton!

D. B.	Hello?
ANN	John! I'm so glad to see you. IÂI was terribly worried.

ANN	Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
EDDIE	All set, Ann?
ANN	Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.

EDDIE	That's good.
ANN	No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
EDDIE	Oh.
ANN	Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.

ANN	Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
MOTHER	Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
ANN	Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
MOTHER	Your purse. I need ten dollars.
ANN	What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
MOTHER	Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseÂand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around andÂ
ANN	And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
MOTHER	The Websters.
ANN	The Websters!
MOTHER	You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poorÂ
ANN	You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
MOTHER	Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
ANN	If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.

ANN	Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
MOTHER	Do you mean the speech you're writing?
ANN	Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
MOTHER	Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
ANN	What?
MOTHER	Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
ANN	Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
MOTHER	Wait a minute . . .
ANN	Huh?

MOTHER	That's your father's diary, Ann.
ANN	Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
MOTHER	There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
ANN	You bet I will, Ma.

CONNELL	Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
ANN	Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .

ANN	I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
CONNELL	It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersÂstart arguments.
ANN	Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.

CONNELL	No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
ANN	I remember, distinctly, being fired.
CONNELL	That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
ANN	What's that?
CONNELL	The letter.
ANN	What letter?
CONNELL	The letter from John Doe.
ANN	Oh!
CONNELL	The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
ANN	There is no letter.
CONNELL	We'll get a handwriting expert toÂ  What!
ANN	There is no letter.

CONNELL	Say that again.
ANN	There is no letter. I made it up.

CONNELL	You made it up.
ANN	Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.

ANN	Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
CONNELL	In what man!
ANN	John Doe.
CONNELL	What John Doe?
ANN	Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, geniusÂ Now, look. Suppose there was a John DoeÂand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
CONNELL	A deal?
ANN	Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.

ANN	Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
CONNELL	So?

CONNELL	Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
ANN	John Doe.
CONNELL	What John Doe?
ANN	The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!

CONNELL	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
ANN	Well, you're catching on.
CONNELL	Who, for instance?
ANN	Anybody! Er, erÂBeany'll do!

ANN	You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
CONNELL	Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.

ANN	That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
CONNELL	That's all, Ned. Thank you.

CONNELL	Okay, sister, you get your job back.
ANN	Plus a bonus.
CONNELL	What bonus?

CONNELL	I can read. I can read!
ANN	Sorry.

CONNELL	So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
ANN	Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
CONNELL	Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.

CONNELL	Looks all rightÂ
ANN	He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
CONNELL	I wish he had a family, though.

ANN	That's our man. He's made to order.
CONNELL	I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
ANN	When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.

CONNELL	Hurry up, Pop.
ANN	Oh.
CONNELL	Right here. Sit down.

CONNELL	All right, boys, here he is.
ANN	No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like thatÂeating a sandwichÂand with a beard!

CONNELL	But, he's gonna jump off a building!
ANN	Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
CONNELL	Well, maybe you're right.
ANN	We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomÂunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
CONNELL	Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
ANN	Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
CONNELL	Yes.  What's he doing here?
ANN	Friend of his. They play duets together.
CONNELL	Duets? But can we trust him?
ANN	Oh!

CONNELL	Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
ANN	I got it all ready. Here.
CONNELL	Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?

CONNELL	Okay, fellows.
ANN	Take it easy, John Doe.

CONNELL	And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific!  No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
ANN	Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
CONNELL	Awwwww!

CONNELL	Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledÂthe Governor's starting a libel suitÂwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyÂand they insist on seeing him.
ANN	Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?

CONNELL	Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayÂhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
ANN	If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
CONNELL	No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
ANN	Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.

ANN	What's the idea?
CONNELL	No, no, no. Now that's too much!

CONNELL	Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
ANN	That's fine, honey. Now, get out!

CONNELL	Now listen, AnnÂhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
ANN	Thank you.

ANN	How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
COLONEL	Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
ANN	Well, nobody asked yuh.
COLONEL	Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!

ANN	Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
COLONEL	That'sÂ

ANN	Colonel!
COLONEL	You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
ANN	Has he been here?
COLONEL	No.
ANN	Have you seen him?
COLONEL	I ain't seen him for a week.
ANN	Where's Connell?
COLONEL	He's watching the other door.
ANN	Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.

COLONEL	No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
ANN	Oh, let me go, will you!
COLONEL	Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!

ANN	Had any schooling?
TALL CHAP	Yeah, a little.
ANN	What do you do when you work?
TALL CHAP	I used to pitch.
ANN	Baseball?
TALL CHAP	Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
ANN	Where'd you play?
TALL CHAP	Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.

BEANY	I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
CONNELL	Where is she?
BEANY	Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
CONNELL	Did you find her?
BEANY	No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
CONNELL	Go out and find her!
BEANY	Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .

CONNELL	Hello! . . . Yeh?
BEANY	Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.

BEANY	just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl thereÂ
CONNELL	Shut up!

BEANY	Ann! Say, why didn't yuhÂ
CONNELL	Beany!

BEANY	Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
CONNELL	What?
BEANY	Look!

CONNELL	What do they want?
BEANY	They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.

BEANY	Yeah, Boss?
CONNELL	Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.

CONNELL	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
BEANY	Both of 'em?
CONNELL	Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.

BEANY	Hey, Boss.
CONNELL	Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?

BEANY	Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
CONNELL	Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.

BEANY	Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
CONNELL	. . . Tubby?

BEANY	Help yourself.
COLONEL	Naw.

COLONEL	I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guyÂ
BEANY	Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?

BEANY	Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
COLONEL	And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
BEANY	Who's got him?
COLONEL	The heelots!
BEANY	Who?

COLONEL	And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
BEANY	Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?

BEANY	Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
COLONEL	The heelots!
BEANY	Who are they?

COLONEL	Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
BEANY	Sure. Mostly often.
COLONEL	All right. You're walking alongÂnot a nickel in your jeansÂfree as the windÂnobody bothers youÂhundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of businessÂshoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?

BEANY	Ba-ll!
COLONEL	I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.

BEANY	St-rike!
COLONEL	I know why you're hangin' aroundÂyou're stuck on a girlÂthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.

COLONEL	Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
BEANY	There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.

BERT	Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
BERT'S WIFE	Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
BERT	Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.

BERT'S WIFE	Grubbel's here. See? 
BERT	Yeah. That'sÂthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
BERT'S WIFE	Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.

BERT	You don't have toÂWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
BERT'S WIFE	What Bert's trying to say isÂwellÂwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.

BERT	This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
SOURPUSS	ThÂthat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
BERT	Well, anyway, IÂI guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
SOURPUSS	Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.

SOURPUSS	And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
BERT	Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.

SOURPUSS	Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
BERT	Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man DelaneyÂ

SOURPUSS	No!
BERT	Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.

SOURPUSS	How could he be a fake? 
BERT	It must be some kind of a gag.
SOURPUSS	A what?
BERT	A gag. A gag!

SOURPUSS	It makes no difference, BertÂthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
BERT	Yeah? Well, you can have it!

SOURPUSS	That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
BERT	Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.

JOHN	Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
COLONEL	You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
JOHN	Sure, you are.
COLONEL	No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.

COLONEL	Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
JOHN	Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
COLONEL	Aw, Long John . . . I tell youÂit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
JOHN	Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.

JOHN	Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
COLONEL	I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!

JOHN	You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
COLONEL	You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsÂa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.

JOHN	I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
COLONEL	The elevators are still runnin'.

COLONEL	Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
JOHN	What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
COLONEL	Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
JOHN	Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!

COLONEL	Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
JOHN	Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
COLONEL	Four bits.
JOHN	Better make it doughnuts, huh?
COLONEL	Yeh.

COLONEL	Join the John Doe Club.
JOHN	John Doe Club?

JOHN	I trust him.
CONNELL	Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?

JOHN	Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
CONNELL	Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!

JOHN	Hello, Mr. Connell.
CONNELL	Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matterÂare you falling? Come here.

JOHN	No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
CONNELL	Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.

CONNELL	Now, that's all right, isn't it?
JOHN	You betcha.

CONNELL	I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfÂI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named JeffersonÂand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
JOHN	Yeah, you bet!

CONNELL	Listen, palÂthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
JOHN	Yeah. It certainly is.
CONNELL	And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?

JOHN	You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
CONNELL	Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
JOHN	Sure.
CONNELL	Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.

CONNELL	All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
JOHN	Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
CONNELL	Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
JOHN	You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
CONNELL	They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.

CONNELL	Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
JOHN	Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'dÂ

D. B.	Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
CONNELL	Why, D. B., you're not going to fall forÂ
D. B.	I want it as soon as possible.
CONNELL	Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.

CONNELL	Well, I don't get it.
D. B.	Huh? Get what?
CONNELL	Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
D. B.	Well?
CONNELL	Well, I'm stuck with two and twoÂbut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
D. B.	WhyÂuhÂ

CONNELL	I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
D. B.	I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellÂI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
CONNELL	Yes. Sure.

POP	Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
CONNELL	How?
POP	Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter andÂ
CONNELL	That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!

CONNELL	Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesÂbut stay out o' newspaper business!
POP	Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.

POP	If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
CONNELL	No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.

POP	Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andÂI'll eat him.
CONNELL	Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appearÂand in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.

CONNELL	Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
TALL CHAP	No, I didn't.

CONNELL	What are you doing up here then?
TALL CHAP	Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.

CONNELL	How about family? Got any family?
TALL CHAP	No.
CONNELL	Oh, just traveling through, huh?
TALL CHAP	Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.

CONNELL	What's your name?
TALL CHAP	Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.

JOHN	Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
D. B.	There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that peopleÂ
JOHN	Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.

D. B.	Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
JOHN	Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.

D. B.	Is there anything wrong?
JOHN	Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big ShotÂyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
D. B.	Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
JOHN	No you won't! You're through deciding anything!

JOHN	That's a lie!
D. B.	It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
JOHN	That's a lie! ListenÂdon't believe what he says . . .
D. B.	Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
JOHN	That's got nothing to do with it!
D. B.	Were you paid for itÂor weren't you?
JOHN	Yes! I was paid! But theÂ
D. B.	And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
JOHN	What difference does that make?
D. B.	Did you write itÂor didn't you?
JOHN	No, I didn't write it, butÂ
D. B.	Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
JOHN	Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing startedÂ
D. B.	There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peopleÂthey ought to run you out of the countryÂand I hope they do it!

MRS. MITCHELL	It's good to see you. Sit down.
JOHN	Thanks.

JOHN	It's for Ann . . .
MRS. MITCHELL	Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
JOHN	Flowers.
MRS. MITCHELL	I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
JOHN	She isn't?
MRS. MITCHELL	No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
JOHN	Oh!
MRS. MITCHELL	Did you want to see her about something important?
JOHN	Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for theÂ

JOHN	Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
MRS. MITCHELL	Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.

JOHN	Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
MRS. MITCHELL	Good night, John.

JOHN	Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
MRS. MITCHELL	Uh-huh.
JOHN	Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.

JOHN	I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
MRS. MITCHELL	You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
JOHN	Well, I was thinking thatÂYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.

JOHN	Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
MIKE	Nineteen!
JOHN	Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
MIKE	That's too bad.
JOHN	What do you mean, too bad?
MIKE	Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
JOHN	Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get aÂ
MIKE	Well, you know how they are in baseballÂif a guy's mixed up in a racketÂ
JOHN	Racket? What do you mean?
MIKE	Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
JOHN	Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
MIKE	And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveÂflopped into a chairÂand has taken out his ocarina.

MIKE	I know one way you can do it.
JOHN	How?
MIKE	Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!

JOHN	Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
MIKE	Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.

JOHN	Say, who's putting up this dough?
MIKE	Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeÂand it's all written out for you.

MIKE	Have you got the speech I gave you?
JOHN	Yeah.
MIKE	Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
JOHN	Okay.

SECRETARY	Spencer of the Chronicle .
MAYOR	Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.

MAYOR	Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
SECRETARY	Shh!
MAYOR	What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
SECRETARY	What?
MAYOR	Out the window! Something just flew by!
SECRETARY	I didn't see anything.
MAYOR	Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?

MAYOR	Is there a crowd in the street?
SECRETARY	No, sir.
MAYOR	Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
SECRETARY	I think it must have been a sea- gull.
MAYOR	A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
SECRETARY	Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
MAYOR	I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!

2ND BODYGUARD	No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
LONGFELLOW	Who are you?

2ND BODYGUARD	Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
LONGFELLOW	That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.

LONGFELLOW	That's going to be fun.
2ND BODYGUARD	Some people like it.

2ND BODYGUARD	Put that away, slug!  At your service!
LONGFELLOW	I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
2ND BODYGUARD	Certainly.

CEDAR	Good morning.
AGENT	Morning, neighbors. Morning.

CEDAR	I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
AGENT	Deeds?
CEDAR	Yes.
AGENT	Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
CEDAR	Yes, IÂ

CEDAR	We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
AGENT	Who's that?
CEDAR	Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
AGENT	Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.

JANE	Since he was born.
AMY	Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
JANE	He was a seven-months baby.

JANE	Most every day.
AMY	Sometimes twice.

JANE	They think he's pixilated.
AMY	Oh yes, pixilated.

JANE	Pixilated.
AMY	Uh-huh.

JANE	He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
AMY	Sometimes he whistles.
JANE	And sings.

JANE	For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
AMY	Never can tell what he's going to do.
JANE	He sure is pixilated.
AMY	Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.

JANE	Why, you own it, Longfellow.
AMY	Yes, you own it.

JANE	Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
AMY	Always.

JANE	Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
AMY	Uh-huh.

JANE	Oh, yes.
AMY	Yes, indeedy.

JANE	He's still pixilated.
AMY	He sure is.

LONGFELLOW	Are you married?
APPLICANT	Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Any children?
APPLICANT	No, no children.
LONGFELLOW	All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
APPLICANT	Thank you very much.
LONGFELLOW	Next, please.

BABE	No. Are you?
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE	No.
BABE	You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE	I haven't.
BABE	Why not?

LONGFELLOW'S VOICE	I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
BABE	Would you like to go for a walk?

BABE	It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
CEDAR	Your Honor!

CEDAR	Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
BABE	No!

CEDAR	You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
BABE	No! I resigned last week!

CEDAR	Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
BABE	Yes.
CEDAR	Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
BABE	Yes!
CEDAR	Are these the articles?
BABE	Yes!
CEDAR	Were you present when all these things took place?
BABE	Yes!
CEDAR	Are they true!
BABE	NO!!
CEDAR	But they did take place?
BABE	They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
CEDAR	And you saw them happen?
BABE	Yes, but IÂ
CEDAR	That's all, Miss Bennett.
BABE	It isn't all! I'd like to explainÂ
CEDAR	That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.

BABE	Oh, thank you!
CEDAR	Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.

CEDAR	Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
BABE	What's that got to do with it?
CEDAR	Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
BABE	What's that got to do with it?
CEDAR	You are , aren't you?
BABE	Yes!!!

LONGFELLOW	You fainted.
BABE	Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .

BABE	No, thank you. I'll be all right.
LONGFELLOW	Look, this is my house. I'd like toÂ
BABE	Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
LONGFELLOW	What happened?
BABE	Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.

LONGFELLOW	Feel better now?
BABE	Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
LONGFELLOW	Tell me more about yourself.
BABE	Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.

BABE	Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
LONGFELLOW	You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
BABE	What?
LONGFELLOW	Oh - uh - nothing.

BABE	You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
LONGFELLOW	No. That is, I didn'tÂ  Until I met you. I like talking to you, thoughÂ  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.

LONGFELLOW	Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
BABE	Really?

LONGFELLOW	There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
BABE	Oh, I don't mind.

LONGFELLOW	It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
BABE	I enjoy it.
LONGFELLOW	The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
BABE	Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.

LONGFELLOW	Sure. I met you.
BABE	Oh. What's happening about the opera?
LONGFELLOW	Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman ifÂ

LONGFELLOW	I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
BABE	What did they say?
LONGFELLOW	Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
BABE	What did they say?
LONGFELLOW	Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
BABE	What are they going to do?
LONGFELLOW	Do you always wear your hair like that?

LONGFELLOW	Have you seen the papers?
BABE	Uh-huh.
LONGFELLOW	That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuffÂ

BABE	Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
LONGFELLOW	Yes.
BABE	Yeah, let's.

BABE	There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
LONGFELLOW	It's wonderful.
BABE	To most people, it's an awful letdown.
LONGFELLOW	Huh?
BABE	I say, to most people it's a washout.
LONGFELLOW	That depends on what they see.
BABE	Now, what do you see?
LONGFELLOW	Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as PresidentÂ  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.

BABE	There's Times Square.
LONGFELLOW	You can almost spit on it, can't you?
BABE	Why don't you try?

BABE	You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
LONGFELLOW	I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?

BABE	Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
LONGFELLOW	Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?

BABE	Here's a nice place.
LONGFELLOW	Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.

BABE	You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
LONGFELLOW	What's that?
BABE	You said I was a lady in distress.
LONGFELLOW	Oh, thatÂ
BABE	What did you mean by that?
LONGFELLOW	NothingÂ

LONGFELLOW	Oh, I don't know.
BABE	You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
LONGFELLOW	I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live  Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.

LONGFELLOW	I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
BABE	I'm from a small town too, you know.
LONGFELLOW	Really?
BABE	Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
LONGFELLOW	Gosh! What do you know about that!

BABE	I've often thought about going back.
LONGFELLOW	You have?
BABE	Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
LONGFELLOW	He sounds like a person worth while knowing.

BABE	He played in the town band, too.
LONGFELLOW	He did? I play the tubaÂ
BABE	Yeah, I know.
LONGFELLOW	What did he play?
BABE	The drums. He taught me to play some.
LONGFELLOW	He did?
BABE	Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
LONGFELLOW	Sure!

BABE	Oh, I suppose you could do better.
LONGFELLOW	Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
BABE	Humoresque? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
LONGFELLOW	Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
BABE	It had better be good.

LONGFELLOW	Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
BABE	No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.

LONGFELLOW	I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
BABE	Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
LONGFELLOW	You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
BABE	I'd like to read it some time.

BABE	I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
LONGFELLOW	Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
BABE	You threw them out!

LONGFELLOW	Yes, if it isn't too late.
BABE	I'll get my hat.

BABE	Ready?
LONGFELLOW	Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
BABE	Thank you.

LONGFELLOW	The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
BABE	Let's just walk, okay?
LONGFELLOW	All right.

LONGFELLOW	Mary, I'm going home.
BABE	Are you? When?
LONGFELLOW	In a day or so, I think.
BABE	I don't blame you.

LONGFELLOW	Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
BABE	No, I don't mind.
LONGFELLOW	All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
BABE	A girl?
LONGFELLOW	Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.

LONGFELLOW	Well, here we are again.
BABE	Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
LONGFELLOW	Mary - I - excuse meÂ

LONGFELLOW	Would you like to read it? It's to you.
BABE	Yes, of course.

LONGFELLOW	Hello, Mary?
BABE	Oh, hello darling.

MABEL	What's the matter, hon?
BABE	Nothing.

MABEL	What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
BABE	No. It's nothing.
MABEL	My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
BABE	Don't be ridiculous.

MABEL	You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
BABE	I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.

BABE	Good night.
BABE	Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
MABEL	Uh-huh.
BABE	I'm crucifying him.
MABEL	People have been crucified before.
BABE	Why? Why do we have to do it?
MABEL	You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
BABE	Yeah, then what?
MABEL	Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
BABE	Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
MABEL	The guy's balmy.
BABE	Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
MABEL	Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
BABE	He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
MABEL	Huh?
BABE	No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.

MABEL	You're a fool, Babe.
BABE	I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
MABEL	Running away is no solution.

MABEL	What'll I tell him if he calls up?
BABE	Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
MABEL	You're acting like a school girl.
BABE	What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .

MABEL	Just a minute. No, you don't.
BABE	We're not going out tonight.

MABEL	Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
BABE	Hello.

BABE	Look, I can do it!
MAC	What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
BABE	Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
MAC	Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can haveÂ
BABE	Can I have a month's vacation?
MAC	With pay!
BABE	With pay!
MAC	Uh-huh.
BABE	Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.

MAC	Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
BABE	Have lunch.

MAC	Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
BABE	It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
MAC	Did it?
BABE	I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
MAC	Is he really that big a sap?

BABE	He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
MAC	Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
BABE	If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.

MAC	How'd you get the picture?
BABE	Had the boys follow us.
MAC	Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
BABE	I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
MAC	When're you going to see him again?
BABE	Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.

MAC	You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
BABE	I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
MAC	Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
BABE	Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
MAC	Sure.
BABE	With pay!  She is out the door.
MAC	You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.

MAC	What's bothering you, huh?
BABE	Last night he proposed to me.
MAC	Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
BABE	Yes.
MAC	Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl ThatÂ"
BABE	Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
MAC	Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and heÂ
BABE	Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
MAC	Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?

MAC	What're you going to do?
BABE	I'm going to tell him the truth.
MAC	Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
BABE	I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
MAC	You're crazy! You can't do that!

BABE	He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
MAC	I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
BABE	That's the rub.
MAC	Oh, as bad as that, huh?
BABE	Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.

BABE	This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
MAC	Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?

MAC	It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
BABE	Hello . . .

BOB	I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
FRANK	I tell you that dame's nuts.
BOB	Right.

FRANK	Come on, come on!
BOB	Hurry up!

BOB	It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
FRANK	Babe ought to get him drunk again.

BOB	I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
FRANK	Shhh!

FRANK	Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
BOB	Boy, was he burning.
FRANK	Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.

FRANK	Ow! My foot's asleep!
BOB	Come on - let's go!

CEDAR	We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
BUDINGTON	JohnÂ
CEDAR	Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?

CEDAR	I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
BUDINGTON	But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uhÂ
CEDAR	Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
BUDINGTON	But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to getÂ
CEDAR	Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.

BUDINGTON	don't want to be critical, John, but here it isÂ
CEDAR	Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
BUDINGTON	Yes, but you saidÂ
CEDAR	I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!

BUTLER	The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
LONGFELLOW	They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?

LONGFELLOW	Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
BUTLER	Yes, sir.

LONGFELLOW	Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
BUTLER	Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Who? Miss Dawson?
BUTLER	Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.

LONGFELLOW	You try it.
BUTLER	Me, sir?

LONGFELLOW	How's it going? Okay?
BUTLER	Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Gold, eh?
BUTLER	Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Fourteen carat?
BUTLER	Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Is that the best you've got?
BUTLER	Oh, yes sir.
LONGFELLOW	Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
BUTLER	A smaller bowl of flowers.

BUTLER	Stuff, sir?
LONGFELLOW	That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
BUTLER	Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
BUTLER	Yes, sir.

LONGFELLOW	Sit over there, will you?
BUTLER	Me sir?
LONGFELLOW	Yes.

BUTLER	How is this, sir?
LONGFELLOW	Perfect! Perfect!
BUTLER	I wish you luck, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.

BUTLERS	You can't come up here!
FARMER	Let me go! I wanna see him!
BUTLERS	He's not home, I tell you!
FARMER	I wanna see that guy!
BUTLERS	We'll send for the police!
FARMER	Let me go!

CEDAR	Thank heaven.
FIRST BROTHER	Better wire him right away, John.
CEDAR	I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.

FIRST BROTHER	Come on, John. What happened?
CEDAR	The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.

CEDAR	Relatives of old man Semple.
FIRST BROTHER	They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
CEDAR	Nuisance value?
FIRST BROTHER	They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
CEDAR	Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?

JUDGE	Miss Bennett please!
CEDAR	This is outrageous!

CEDAR	The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
JUDGE	Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.

JUDGE	Must we have the echo?
CEDAR	Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?

JUDGE	He's what?
CEDAR	What was that you said he was?

CEDAR	Your Honor, I object.
JUDGE	Proceed.

CEDAR	It's a lie!
JUDGE	Mr. Cedar!
CEDAR	Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!

JUDGE	You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
CEDAR	But your honorÂ
JUDGE	Mr. Cedar!

CEDAR	Newspaperman?
COBB	Wants to know who the heir is.
CEDAR	Hang up.
COBB	Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorneyÂ
CEDAR	Hang up.

COBB	Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
CEDAR	I'm not interested in the newspapers.
COBB	But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
CEDAR	Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
COBB	It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.

COBB	That's pretty.
CEDAR	Are you sure this is the town he lives in?

CEDAR	I guess we'd better try somebody else.
COBB	No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.

COBB	Yeah. A glorified doormat.
CEDAR	Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.

CEDAR	I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
COBB	See you later, kid.

COBB	I can't find him.
CEDAR	You can't?
COBB	I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.

COBB	Look!
CEDAR	What?
COBB	That tuba player!

CEDAR	Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
COBB	I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.

VOICE	Yes?
CEDAR	Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
VOICE	Where?
CEDAR	Mandrake Falls.  M-A-NÂ

CEDAR	Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
VOICE	All set.
CEDAR	Okay, then. Go to it.  And, CharlieÂ
VOICE	Yeah?
CEDAR	Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
VOICE	Okay.

CEDAR	Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
LONGFELLOW	Yes.
CEDAR	How do you do.
LONGFELLOW	How do you do.
CEDAR	I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.

CEDAR	I'd like to ask you a few questions.
LONGFELLOW	All right.

CEDAR	Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
LONGFELLOW	Yes.
CEDAR	Are your parents living?
LONGFELLOW	Why, no.
CEDAR	Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
LONGFELLOW	Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
CEDAR	Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
LONGFELLOW	He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do toÂ

CEDAR	Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
LONGFELLOW	Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?

CEDAR	Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
LONGFELLOW	Buffer?

CEDAR	Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW	Who - me? No.

CEDAR	Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
LONGFELLOW	What for?
CEDAR	You're going to New York with us.
LONGFELLOW	When?

CEDAR	Will you have a cigar?
LONGFELLOW	No, thank you.

CEDAR	I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
LONGFELLOW	Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
CEDAR	No?
LONGFELLOW	I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.

CEDAR	It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
LONGFELLOW	Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
CEDAR	Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW	Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
CEDAR	Yes. That is to sayÂ
LONGFELLOW	Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
CEDAR	Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
LONGFELLOW	That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
CEDAR	Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
LONGFELLOW	Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.

CEDAR	I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW	Huh?
CEDAR	I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
LONGFELLOW	Oh, yes. Yes, I will.

LONGFELLOW	Why not? Who is he?
CEDAR	A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
LONGFELLOW	Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.

CEDAR	He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW	How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.

CEDAR	I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
LONGFELLOW	You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
CEDAR	Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.

MRS. MEREDITH	Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
CEDAR	Is Mr. Deeds in?
MRS. MEREDITH	No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.

MRS. MEREDITH	Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
CEDAR	No, thanks.
MRS. MEREDITH	Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
CEDAR	That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
MRS. MEREDITH	No, I'm his housekeeper.
CEDAR	Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
MRS. MEREDITH	He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.

COBB	Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
LONGFELLOW	Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.

LONGFELLOW	Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
COBB	Why should you?
LONGFELLOW	Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
COBB	Nah.
LONGFELLOW	I've got one for CobbÂ
LONGFELLOW	There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!
COBB	Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
LONGFELLOW	Huh?
COBB	I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
LONGFELLOW	Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
COBB	Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.

COBB	This afternoon - at four o'clock.
LONGFELLOW	I don't think we've got any suitcases.

COBB	Have a drink?
LONGFELLOW	No, thanks.

LONGFELLOW	Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
COBB	Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
LONGFELLOW	Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
COBB	Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
LONGFELLOW	He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.

COBB	You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
LONGFELLOW	Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.

LONGFELLOW	Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
COBB	Uh-huh.
LONGFELLOW	That's funny. Why is that?
COBB	Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]

COBB	I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
LONGFELLOW	Only common sense.

COBB	Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
LONGFELLOW	Entertainment?
COBB	Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
LONGFELLOW	What're you talking about?
COBB	Women! Ever heard of 'em?
LONGFELLOW	Oh.
COBB	Name your poison and I'll supply it.
LONGFELLOW	Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
COBB	Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!

COBB	Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
LONGFELLOW	Arthur wants to quit!
COBB	Arthur! Who's Arthur?
LONGFELLOW	He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
COBB	What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?

COBB	And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
LONGFELLOW	Oh, they insisted on following me.
COBB	What do you think bodyguards are for?
LONGFELLOW	What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
COBB	Are those stories true?

LONGFELLOW	I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
COBB	They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
LONGFELLOW	I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
COBB	No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
LONGFELLOW	Sometimes it's the only solution.
COBB	Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
LONGFELLOW	If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going toÂ
COBB	Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
LONGFELLOW	But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
COBB	That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
LONGFELLOW	Yes, I guess I'll have to.
COBB	Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.

COBB	Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
LONGFELLOW	Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
COBB	Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossingÂ

COBB	She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
LONGFELLOW	Shut up!

COBB	You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
LONGFELLOW	They can have the Estate.

COBB	What about your knocking off for lunch?
LONGFELLOW	Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
COBB	Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
LONGFELLOW	Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?

LONGFELLOW	Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
COBB	What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
LONGFELLOW	Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
COBB	Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.

LONGFELLOW	I'm Chairman?
DOUGLAS	Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
LONGFELLOW	I'm Chairman.

LONGFELLOW	Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
DOUGLAS	Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
LONGFELLOW	That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.

DOUGLAS	You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
LONGFELLOW	It isn't? What is it conducted for?
DOUGLAS	Why, it's an artistic institutionÂ
LONGFELLOW	We own an opera house, don't we?

DOUGLAS	We provide opera.
LONGFELLOW	But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?

DOUGLAS	That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
LONGFELLOW	Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.

DOUGLAS	The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
LONGFELLOW	I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
DOUGLAS	Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
LONGFELLOW	Me?!
DOUGLAS	Naturally.
LONGFELLOW	Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .

LONGFELLOW	Now, where were we?
DOUGLAS	You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
LONGFELLOW	Why not?
DOUGLAS	Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
LONGFELLOW	Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.

VON HOLLER	You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
DR. FOSDICK	Uh-huh.
VON HOLLER	Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
DR. FOSDICK	Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
VON HOLLER	It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
DR. FOSDICK	Ja.
VON HOLLER	It takes so long to detect themÂ  Âbecause their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?

LONGFELLOW	Let him alone.
FARMER	Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!

FARMER	Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
LONGFELLOW	A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
FARMER	Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!

FARMER	Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
LONGFELLOW	That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
FARMER	Oh, Mr. DeedsÂ

FARMER	Âmy wife wanted me to tell you sheÂ  Âshe prays for you every night.
LONGFELLOW	Well, thanks, I - uhÂ  How do you do? What is your name?

LONGFELLOW	Mrs. Semple?
HALLOR	Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.

HALLOR	I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
LONGFELLOW	What kind of wife did you say she was?
HALLOR	Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
LONGFELLOW	A child? My uncle's?
HALLOR	Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW	That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
HALLOR	I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW	If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.

HALLOR	Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW	You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.

LONGFELLOW	Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
HALLOR	What about it, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW	Why, I turned them down, naturally.
HALLOR	No, I mean - about my client.
LONGFELLOW	Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.

HALLOR	Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW	Huh?
HALLOR	I say we don't want to appear greedy.
LONGFELLOW	Oh. That.

HALLOR	Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
LONGFELLOW	And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?

HALLOR	Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
LONGFELLOW	One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
HALLOR	Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.

HALLOR	You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW	Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
HALLOR	Now wait a minute, buddyÂ

LONGFELLOW	There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
HALLOR	No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.

LONGFELLOW	No - I don't want it, thank you.
HENABERRY	Why, you must drink! All poets drink!

LONGFELLOW	Well, I don't know. IÂ
HENABERRY	Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.

HENABERRY	Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
LONGFELLOW	Well, I play the tuba.

LONGFELLOW	No.
HENABERRY	You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?

HENABERRY	Look, he's temperamental.
LONGFELLOW	Yeah, what if I am? What about it?

LONGFELLOW	Your HonorÂ
JUDGE	Yes?
LONGFELLOW	I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
JUDGE	Take the stand!

JUDGE	Proceed.
LONGFELLOW	Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that IÂ

JUDGE	A what?
LONGFELLOW	An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.

JUDGE	Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
LONGFELLOW	Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.

LONGFELLOW	Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
JUDGE	Not at all.

JUDGE	Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
LONGFELLOW	Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.

JUDGE	Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
LONGFELLOW	Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.

JUDGE	Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW	No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
JUDGE	Proceed.
LONGFELLOW	Thank you, Your Honor.

WAITER	Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
LONGFELLOW	Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
WAITER	Uh-huh.
LONGFELLOW	I'm a writer myself, you know.

WAITER	Uh-huh.
LONGFELLOW	I write poetry.
WAITER	Uh-huh.

WAITER	Brookfield just came in.
LONGFELLOW	Oh, the poet? Where?
WAITER	Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.

MORROW	Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
LONGFELLOW	That's all right. I got it off my chest.
MORROW	The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!

MORROW	Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
LONGFELLOW	Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
MORROW	Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpetÂ  Âthanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
LONGFELLOW	I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.

MORROW	Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
LONGFELLOW	Binge?
MORROW	Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.

LONGFELLOW	That ought to be fun.
MORROW	Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!

LONGFELLOW	Who are they?
MRS. MEREDITH	I don't know.

LONGFELLOW	New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
MRS. MEREDITH	You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?

MRS. MEREDITH	How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
LONGFELLOW	Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.

MRS. MEREDITH	No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be marriedÂ
LONGFELLOW	Don't pay any attention to her.
MRS. MEREDITH	He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
LONGFELLOW	Now you keep out of this!

MRS. MEREDITH	Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
LONGFELLOW	I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.

LONGFELLOW	Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
MRS. MEREDITH	I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.

LONGFELLOW	What is your name?
SVENSON	Christian Svenson.
LONGFELLOW	Farmer?
SVENSON	Yes, ma'am.
LONGFELLOW	Where is your farm?
SVENSON	South Dakota north.
LONGFELLOW	South Dakota - north?
SVENSON	South Dakota - but on the top.
LONGFELLOW	Oh. Oh!

LONGFELLOW	You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
MABEL	Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
LONGFELLOW	Is she home?
MABEL	Yeah. What?
LONGFELLOW	Is Mary home?

MABEL	You meanÂ  Âby the neck or something?
LONGFELLOW	Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.

LONGFELLOW	Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
MABEL	Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
LONGFELLOW	It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
MABEL	Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.

LONGFELLOW	Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
MABEL	Thank you so much. Good night.

WALTER	Tails tonight, sir?
LONGFELLOW	What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
WALTER	Yes, sir.

LONGFELLOW	What do you think you're doing?
WALTER	Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
WALTER	Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!

WALTER	No, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Excuse me. What did you say?

LONGFELLOW	He talks about women as if they were cattle.
WALTER	Every man to his taste, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
WALTER	Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
LONGFELLOW	Twenty! What did he do with them?
WALTER	That was something I was never able to find out, sir.

WALTER	Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
LONGFELLOW	You're Walter, aren't you?
WALTER	Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW	I just wanted to make sure.

WALTER	Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW	What's that?
WALTER	A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
LONGFELLOW	Prairie? Oysters?
WALTER	Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.

LONGFELLOW	Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
WALTER	Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
LONGFELLOW	She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
WALTER	Oh, I do too, sir.
LONGFELLOW	I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
WALTER	I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.

LONGFELLOW	What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
WALTER	You have no pants, sir.

WALTER	You came home last night - without them.
LONGFELLOW	I did what!
WALTER	As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
WALTER	That's what the two policemen said, sir.
LONGFELLOW	What two policemen?
WALTER	The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"

LONGFELLOW	Please!
WALTER	But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?

WALTER	Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
LONGFELLOW	Looking for?
WALTER	You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
LONGFELLOW	Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
WALTER	Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.

WALTER	Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
LONGFELLOW	Who?
WALTER	Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
LONGFELLOW	What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
WALTER	But she's on the telephoneÂ
LONGFELLOW	Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!

LONGFELLOW	Hey, did you hear that?
WALTER	What, sir?

WALTER	Why, that's an echo, sir!
LONGFELLOW	You try it.
WALTER	Me, sir?
LONGFELLOW	Yeah.

WALTER	Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
LONGFELLOW	Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
WALTER	But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
LONGFELLOW	An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
WALTER	Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.

LONGFELLOW	Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
WALTER	Yes, sir.

WALTER	Shall I call the police, sir?
LONGFELLOW	No!  What do you want!!

ALL THREE RUSSIANS	Thank you, Comrade.
NINOTCHKA	Have you any money?

NINOTCHKA	Well, here are fifty francs.
ALL THREE RUSSIANS	Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
NINOTCHKA	Bring me forty-five back.
ALL THREE RUSSIANS	Naturally, Comrade.

ALL THREE RUSSIANS	What is it, Ninotchka?
NINOTCHKA	It's from Paris.

NINOTCHKA	From Leon.
ALL THREE RUSSIANS	From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?

NINOTCHKA	Good evening, Anna.
ANNA	Good evening, Ninotchka.
NINOTCHKA	Aren't you late?
ANNA	No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.

ANNA	They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
NINOTCHKA	Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
ANNA	I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
NINOTCHKA	A few friends... just a little dinner party.
ANNA	What are you serving?
NINOTCHKA	An omelet.
ANNA	An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
NINOTCHKA	Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
ANNA	It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?

ANNA	I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
NINOTCHKA	You should be more careful, Anna.
ANNA	And you too, Ninotchka.
NINOTCHKA	About what?
ANNA	Ever since you have been back from Paris...
NINOTCHKA	I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
ANNA	That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
NINOTCHKA	I have nothing to hide.
ANNA	You should. I'll show you.

ANNA	When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
NINOTCHKA	I see.
ANNA	You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
NINOTCHKA	Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
ANNA	Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?

NINOTCHKA	No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
ANNA	Tell me... what else did you have?
NINOTCHKA	Well, a hat...
ANNA	What was it like?
NINOTCHKA	It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
ANNA	As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
NINOTCHKA	An evening gown.
ANNA	Evening gown?
NINOTCHKA	A dress you wear in the evening.
ANNA	What do you wear in the morning?
NINOTCHKA	When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
ANNA	You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
NINOTCHKA	Yes.
ANNA	Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
NINOTCHKA	No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
ANNA	And there?
NINOTCHKA	Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
ANNA	They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
NINOTCHKA	You feel it, though.
ANNA	Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
NINOTCHKA	What is it, Anna?
ANNA	You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
NINOTCHKA	You want this?
ANNA	Just for the honeymoon.
NINOTCHKA	You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.

KOPALSKI	Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
BULJANOFF	I don't want to go to Siberia.

KOPALSKI	Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
BULJANOFF	All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.

KOPALSKI	You wouldn't like Razinin.
BULJANOFF	He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!

KOPALSKI	And how is Lord Lavenham?
BULJANOFF	...and little Lady Beatrice?

KOPALSKI	Are we free, Buljanoff?
BULJANOFF	Possibly.

KOPALSKI	No, that's not him...
BULJANOFF	Positively not!

BULJANOFF	That's her.
KOPALSKI	Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
BULJANOFF	Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.

KOPALSKI	You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
BULJANOFF	Or it might be the firing squad!
KOPALSKI	Or we can't go back to Russia!

BULJANOFF	Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
KOPALSKI	That's right.

KOPALSKI	If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
BULJANOFF	I can tell you exactly.

KOPALSKI	A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
BULJANOFF	How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.

KOPALSKI	Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
BULJANOFF	That's another thing... it's spring.

BULJANOFF	It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
KOPALSKI	If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
BULJANOFF	I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the CafÃ© de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.

KOPALSKI	Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
BULJANOFF	...des raisins de MadÃ¨re, des framboises... 

BULJANOFF	And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
KOPALSKI	I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!

KOPALSKI	We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
BULJANOFF	Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.

BULJANOFF	...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
KOPALSKI	Right now it's on the balcony.

BULJANOFF	Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
IRANOFF	Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?

BULJANOFF	Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
IRANOFF	We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.

IRANOFF	Capitalistic methods...
BULJANOFF	They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.

IRANOFF	He's cutting our throat...
BULJANOFF	But what can we do?... We have to accept.

IRANOFF	We don't like Razinin.
BULJANOFF	We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?

BULJANOFF	Misha! Misha!
IRANOFF	What is it?
BULJANOFF	A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!

IRANOFF	That must be the one!
BULJANOFF	Yes, he looks like a comrade!

BULJANOFF	We had to take it on account of the safe.
IRANOFF	For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.

BULJANOFF	And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
IRANOFF	And they might believe her in Moscow.
BULJANOFF	What do you mean they might -- they will!

BULJANOFF	Yes! We could stay with Leon!
IRANOFF	Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?

BULJANOFF	You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
IRANOFF	That's right... and we might as well face it.

BULJANOFF	Let's be happy that we're all alive.
IRANOFF	And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.

IRANOFF	What a lovely room you have here.
BULJANOFF	How many families live here with you?

IRANOFF	She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
BULJANOFF	Just see how happy the people look... from here....

BULJANOFF	And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
IRANOFF	Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.

IRANOFF	We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
BULJANOFF	No, that's bad management.

MANAGER	Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
BULJANOFF	No, no.

BULJANOFF	I am Comrade Buljanoff.
MANAGER	Monsieur.
BULJANOFF	May I ask how much your rooms are?
MANAGER	Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
BULJANOFF	Why should you be afraid?

BULJANOFF	How are things in Moscow?
NINOTCHKA	Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.

BULJANOFF	This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
NINOTCHKA	Which part of the room is mine?

BULJANOFF	Which lawyer?
NINOTCHKA	You didn't get legal advice?
BULJANOFF	We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.

NINOTCHKA	Comrade Buljanoff...
BULJANOFF	Yes, Comrade?
NINOTCHKA	Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
BULJANOFF	With two f's, if you please.

BULJANOFF	Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
NINOTCHKA	You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
BULJANOFF	Yes, Comrade.

BULJANOFF	There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
NINOTCHKA	Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.

NINOTCHKA	Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
BULJANOFF	That's right.

NINOTCHKA	Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
BULJANOFF	I think I need my glasses.

BULJANOFF	Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
NINOTCHKA	Don't worry... there will be enough.

BULJANOFF	It is high time you got out of Russia.
NINOTCHKA	I must be stern with you.

NINOTCHKA	Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
BULJANOFF	Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
NINOTCHKA	But, Comrades...

NINOTCHKA	Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
BULJANOFF	Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
NINOTCHKA	And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
BULJANOFF	With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
NINOTCHKA	Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...

BULJANOFF	All you have to do is say "open sesame."
NINOTCHKA	I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
BULJANOFF	Shall we tell her?

NINOTCHKA	Guest?
BULJANOFF	We have opened a restaurant...

BULJANOFF	We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
NINOTCHKA	Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?

BULJANOFF	You think because you represent the former Duchess...
LEON	The Duchess...
BULJANOFF	The former Duchess!
LEON	In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...

BULJANOFF	Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
LEON	Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?

LEON	About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
BULJANOFF	Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 

BULJANOFF	Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
LEON	Oh, yes, yes.

LEON	Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
BULJANOFF	Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.

GASTON	Good morning, Your Highness.
SWANA	Good morning, Gaston.
GASTON	Count d'Algout is still asleep.
SWANA	That's all right.

SWANA	Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
GASTON	Shall I draw your bath, sir?

GASTON	A blue shirt, perhaps?
SWANA	Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
GASTON	Very well, Your Highness.

LEON	Good evening, Gaston.
GASTON	Good evening, Monsieur.

GASTON	Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
LEON	Go to bed.

GASTON	Your breakfast, monsieur.
LEON	I don't feel like any breakfast.

LEON	What time have you, Gaston?
GASTON	Eight forty-two, sir.
LEON	I guess it is eight forty-two.
GASTON	You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
LEON	I am, Gaston.
GASTON	If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
LEON	Have you?
GASTON	Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
LEON	And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
GASTON	Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
LEON	Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
GASTON	May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
LEON	I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
GASTON	No, sir.
LEON	Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
GASTON	No, sir.
LEON	Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
GASTON	Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.

GENERAL SAVITZKY	Your Highness...
SWANA	Yes, General Savitzky?
GENERAL SAVITZKY	I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
SWANA	Are they indeed? Thank you.
GENERAL SAVITZKY	They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
SWANA	General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?

SWANA	You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
GENERAL SAVITZKY	Yes.

SWANA	General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
GENERAL SAVITZKY	Certainly.

HEADWAITER	Good evening, Your Highness.
SWANA	Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
HEADWAITER	Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
SWANA	Count d'Algout...
HEADWAITER	It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.

HEADWAITER	Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
SWANA	That's perfect!

HEADWAITER	Is this satisfactory?
SWANA	Thank you, Louis.

KOPALSKI	Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
IRANOFF	Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?

KOPALSKI	They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
IRANOFF	Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.

IRANOFF	I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
KOPALSKI	If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
IRANOFF	He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"

KOPALSKI	We can wait.
IRANOFF	Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?

IRANOFF	You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
KOPALSKI	These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.

KOPALSKI	We can call our ambassador.
IRANOFF	I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!

IRANOFF	That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
KOPALSKI	Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.

KOPALSKI	Yes, Leon...
IRANOFF	What is it, my boy?

IRANOFF	Leon, my little boy.
KOPALSKI	Oh, Leon, you are so good.

KOPALSKI	Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
IRANOFF	It is Thursday!

IRANOFF	This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
KOPALSKI	How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?

KOPALSKI	We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
IRANOFF	We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.

IRANOFF	They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
KOPALSKI	While you eat, you look at the view.

IRANOFF	Let's do that.
KOPALSKI	It's a real Paris reunion.
IRANOFF	If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.

IRANOFF	...des petites fraises des bois... de la crÃ¨me de Bretagne... 
KOPALSKI	...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!

KOPALSKI	Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
IRANOFF	Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

IRANOFF	That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
KOPALSKI	Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
IRANOFF	...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.

KOPALSKI	Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
IRANOFF	...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.

KOPALSKI	There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
IRANOFF	...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....

IRANOFF	We don't want to be disturbed.
LEON	My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
IRANOFF	If you want to see us you must come later.
LEON	I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
IRANOFF	But you can't...

LEON	Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
IRANOFF	Get out of here!
LEON	Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.

IRANOFF	All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
LEON	But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
IRANOFF	I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
LEON	Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.

IRANOFF	What proposition?
LEON	I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.

LEON	What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
IRANOFF	Razinin.
LEON	Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.

IRANOFF	And if we have to go to Siberia...
LEON	I'll send you a muff.

IRANOFF	She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
LEON	What did she say about me?
IRANOFF	I think she covered you with the parasites.

IRANOFF	You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
LEON	No, no.

NINOTCHKA	I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
IRANOFF	I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
NINOTCHKA	I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.

IRANOFF	Comrade Buljanoff...
NINOTCHKA	Comrade.
IRANOFF	Comrade Kopalski...
NINOTCHKA	Comrade.
IRANOFF	What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.

NINOTCHKA	How much does this cost?
IRANOFF	Two thousand francs.
NINOTCHKA	A week?
IRANOFF	A day.
NINOTCHKA	Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
IRANOFF	A cow?
NINOTCHKA	Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?

NINOTCHKA	Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
IRANOFF	Too bad we have to waste all that time.

NINOTCHKA	Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
IRANOFF	Brave... that's right.

NINOTCHKA	Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
IRANOFF	Just three people in a room this size? Whew!

IRANOFF	Bad news?
NINOTCHKA	Look for yourselves.

NINOTCHKA	But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
IRANOFF	Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
NINOTCHKA	You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
IRANOFF	Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.

IRANOFF	...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
NINOTCHKA	You mean you are deserting Russia?

MANAGER	Yes, monsieur?
IRANOFF	Just looking around.

IRANOFF	This is Comrade Kopalski.
MANAGER	Monsieur.

MANAGER	I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
IRANOFF	Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
MANAGER	I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
IRANOFF	That's even better.
MANAGER	But, gentlemen, I am afraid...

IRANOFF	A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
MANAGER	Yes, monsieur.
IRANOFF	Right away... instantly!

KOPALSKI	Now, monsieur, you have no right...
LEON	Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.

KOPALSKI	We may have a chance.
LEON	Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
KOPALSKI	We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
LEON	All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!

LEON	How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
KOPALSKI	If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!

LEON	What's new?
KOPALSKI	Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!

LEON	Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
KOPALSKI	She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
LEON	All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
KOPALSKI	We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...

KOPALSKI	If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
NINOTCHKA	Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?

KOPALSKI	He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
NINOTCHKA	Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?

KOPALSKI	Allow me, Comrade.
NINOTCHKA	No, thank you.

NINOTCHKA	What's that?
KOPALSKI	It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.

NINOTCHKA	I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
KOPALSKI	We did our best, Comrade.
NINOTCHKA	I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?

KOPALSKI	We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
NINOTCHKA	I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.

NINOTCHKA	Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
KOPALSKI	We did it with the best intentions...
NINOTCHKA	We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
KOPALSKI	Yes, Comrade.
NINOTCHKA	You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.

KOPALSKI	I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
NINOTCHKA	Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.

KOPALSKI	If there is anything we can do for you...
NINOTCHKA	No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?

NINOTCHKA	How are you, you three scoundrels?
KOPALSKI	Well, we're back home.

KOPALSKI	And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
NINOTCHKA	Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
KOPALSKI	Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
NINOTCHKA	And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.

NINOTCHKA	The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
KOPALSKI	Even the swallows are back.

NINOTCHKA	Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
KOPALSKI	Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
NINOTCHKA	We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.

KOPALSKI	...and Kopalski.
NINOTCHKA	Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.

NINOTCHKA	I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
LAWYER	The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
NINOTCHKA	That's two weeks from Thursday...
LAWYER	We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
NINOTCHKA	I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
LAWYER	Yes. It is unfortunate.
NINOTCHKA	Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?

LAWYER	We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
NINOTCHKA	Au revoir.

LEON	Give me another double brandy.
MANAGER	That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
LEON	What can I do about it?
MANAGER	She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
LEON	You want me to go in there?
MANAGER	I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.

LEON	Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
OFFICIAL	Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
LEON	Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
OFFICIAL	Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
LEON	Don't hold that against me... please!
OFFICIAL	Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
LEON	Business.
OFFICIAL	What business?
LEON	Private.
OFFICIAL	There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
LEON	Confess what?
OFFICIAL	Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
LEON	On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
OFFICIAL	You believe in our cause?

LEON	She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
OFFICIAL	The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
LEON	Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
OFFICIAL	But you had!
LEON	Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
OFFICIAL	I think so too.
LEON	I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
OFFICIAL	So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
LEON	Yes!
OFFICIAL	No visa.
LEON	I must get into that country of yours!
OFFICIAL	Oh no. No visa.
LEON	That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
OFFICIAL	You're going to force us... huh?
LEON	Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
OFFICIAL	Why should I take a chance?
LEON	On what?
OFFICIAL	How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
LEON	What for... why?
OFFICIAL	Or a tunnel or a bridge...
LEON	Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....

NINOTCHKA	You, please.
LEON	Me?
NINOTCHKA	Yes. Could you give me some information?
LEON	Gladly.
NINOTCHKA	How long do we have to wait here?
LEON	Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
NINOTCHKA	At what intervals does he whistle?
LEON	What?
NINOTCHKA	How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
LEON	That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
NINOTCHKA	Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
LEON	Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
NINOTCHKA	In other words you don't know.
LEON	No.
NINOTCHKA	Thank you.
LEON	You're welcome.

LEON	Can I help you?
NINOTCHKA	You might hold this for me.
LEON	Love to.
NINOTCHKA	Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
LEON	Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
NINOTCHKA	No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
LEON	Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
NINOTCHKA	I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
LEON	Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
NINOTCHKA	How long does it take a man to land?
LEON	Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.

NINOTCHKA	Why do you need my finger?
LEON	Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
NINOTCHKA	And where are we?
LEON	Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
NINOTCHKA	I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
LEON	I don't have to but I find it natural.
NINOTCHKA	Suppress it.
LEON	I'll try.

NINOTCHKA	For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
LEON	Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
NINOTCHKA	You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
LEON	Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
NINOTCHKA	I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
LEON	A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
NINOTCHKA	Your type will soon be extinct.

LEON	The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
NINOTCHKA	Go ahead.

LEON	Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
NINOTCHKA	That's a strange angle.
LEON	Yes, very strange.

NINOTCHKA	You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
LEON	And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
NINOTCHKA	Yes, it is.
LEON	I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
NINOTCHKA	Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
LEON	You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!

NINOTCHKA	I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
LEON	What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La BohÃ¨me... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
NINOTCHKA	I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
LEON	It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
NINOTCHKA	So that is your house?
LEON	Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
NINOTCHKA	Does that mean that you want me to go there?
LEON	Please don't misunderstand me...
NINOTCHKA	Then you don't want me to go there.
LEON	Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
NINOTCHKA	Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
LEON	I will do my best.

NINOTCHKA	Is this what you call the "butler"?
LEON	Yes.
NINOTCHKA	Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
LEON	He takes good care of that.
NINOTCHKA	He looks sad. Do you whip him?
LEON	No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
NINOTCHKA	The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.

LEON	Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
NINOTCHKA	Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.

NINOTCHKA	What do we do now?
LEON	We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
NINOTCHKA	Is that customary?
LEON	It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
NINOTCHKA	I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
LEON	Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
NINOTCHKA	I will start with you.
LEON	That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
NINOTCHKA	And what is your profession?
LEON	Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
NINOTCHKA	And what do you do for mankind?
LEON	For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
NINOTCHKA	You are something we do not have in Russia.
LEON	Thank you. Thank you.
NINOTCHKA	That is why I believe in the future of my country.
LEON	I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
NINOTCHKA	You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
LEON	Ni-notchka.
NINOTCHKA	That is correct.
LEON	Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
NINOTCHKA	Your general appearance is not distasteful.
LEON	Thank you.
NINOTCHKA	Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
LEON	Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
NINOTCHKA	You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
LEON	Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
NINOTCHKA	I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
LEON	What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
NINOTCHKA	You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
LEON	You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
NINOTCHKA	You repeat yourself.
LEON	I'd like to say it a thousand times.
NINOTCHKA	Don't do it, please.
LEON	I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
NINOTCHKA	It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
LEON	The bayonet? Did you really?
NINOTCHKA	I was wounded before Warsaw.
LEON	Wounded? How?
NINOTCHKA	I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
LEON	I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
NINOTCHKA	A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
LEON	Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
NINOTCHKA	Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.

LEON	What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
NINOTCHKA	Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
LEON	You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.

LEON	Do you hear that?
NINOTCHKA	It's twelve o'clock.
LEON	It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
NINOTCHKA	That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
LEON	I can't possibly think of a better reason.
NINOTCHKA	It's false sentimentality.
LEON	You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?

LEON	Was that talkative?
NINOTCHKA	No, that was restful. Again.

NINOTCHKA	Thank you.
LEON	Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...

LEON	Glorious, analytical...
NINOTCHKA	The telephone is ringing.
LEON	Oh, let it ring.
NINOTCHKA	But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.

NINOTCHKA	I must go.
LEON	Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
NINOTCHKA	Let's forget that we ever met.
LEON	I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
NINOTCHKA	I was sent here by my country to fight you.
LEON	All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
NINOTCHKA	As a representative of Moscow...
LEON	Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
NINOTCHKA	It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
LEON	You know I want to...
NINOTCHKA	Then do it through my lawyer!
LEON	Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.

LEON	But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
NINOTCHKA	I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.

LEON	Room service speaking.
NINOTCHKA	Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
LEON	So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!

LEON	Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
NINOTCHKA	I don't like your following me.
LEON	I didn't follow you.
NINOTCHKA	Then how did you get here?
LEON	I always eat here.
NINOTCHKA	This is a place for workmen.
LEON	But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?

LEON	Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
NINOTCHKA	What are you after?
LEON	Must one always be after something?
NINOTCHKA	Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
LEON	Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
NINOTCHKA	But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
LEON	Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
NINOTCHKA	What?
LEON	Will you smile?
NINOTCHKA	Why?
LEON	Just smile.
NINOTCHKA	At what?
LEON	At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
NINOTCHKA	Why?
LEON	Because we are an odd couple.
NINOTCHKA	Then you should go back to your table.
LEON	No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.

NINOTCHKA	Ha! Ha! Now go back.
LEON	That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
NINOTCHKA	On which boat?
LEON	Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
NINOTCHKA	Probably not.
LEON	Do you like Scotch stories?
NINOTCHKA	I have never heard one.
LEON	Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
NINOTCHKA	I wish they had never met.
LEON	So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!

LEON	I suppose you don't think that's funny?
NINOTCHKA	No.
LEON	It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
NINOTCHKA	I don't think so.
LEON	Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!

LEON	Not funny, huh?
NINOTCHKA	No.
LEON	So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.

LEON	I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
NINOTCHKA	Yes.
LEON	He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
NINOTCHKA	Yes.
LEON	Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"

NINOTCHKA	I don't look too foolish?
LEON	Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.

LEON	You remember this room?
NINOTCHKA	I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
LEON	You see? Life can be so simple.
NINOTCHKA	For twelve francs, seventy-five.
LEON	Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.

NINOTCHKA	It's nine o'clock.
LEON	That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
NINOTCHKA	Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
LEON	A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
NINOTCHKA	Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.

LEON	You see I couldn't shout that.
NINOTCHKA	Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
LEON	No... go on.
NINOTCHKA	Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...

NINOTCHKA	Leon, I would like to ask you something.
LEON	Anything, Ninotchka.
NINOTCHKA	If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
LEON	I promise... I swear.
NINOTCHKA	Did you make any change in this room?
LEON	I don't think so.
NINOTCHKA	When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?

NINOTCHKA	She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
LEON	Ninotchka, I love you.
NINOTCHKA	I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
LEON	Ninotchka, you're jealous.

NINOTCHKA	Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
LEON	My darling.

NINOTCHKA	I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
LEON	It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.

NINOTCHKA	It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
LEON	From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.

NINOTCHKA	From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
LEON	There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!

NINOTCHKA	How do you do?
LEON	And General Savitzky.

NINOTCHKA	Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
LEON	A funny story?
NINOTCHKA	You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
LEON	Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.

NINOTCHKA	Go on.
LEON	No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
NINOTCHKA	Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
LEON	You must, darling.
NINOTCHKA	To the loveliest story I ever heard.

NINOTCHKA	Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
LEON	You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
NINOTCHKA	Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
LEON	What, darling?
NINOTCHKA	Thursday.
LEON	Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.

NINOTCHKA	Comrades! Comrades!
LEON	Darling, darling... please!
NINOTCHKA	I must talk to my brothers!
LEON	Shhh! Shhh!
NINOTCHKA	Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!

LEON	But, darling, you can't do that.
NINOTCHKA	Comrades! Good people of France!
LEON	Now, Ninotchka... please!
NINOTCHKA	They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.

LEON	Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
NINOTCHKA	No speech?
LEON	No speech.
NINOTCHKA	I love you, my little Leonitchka!
LEON	And I adore you, Ninotchua.

NINOTCHKA	Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
LEON	No. Nobody will find us.

NINOTCHKA	Are we going to build our little house?
LEON	Yes... a little white house.
NINOTCHKA	Not white, darling.
LEON	All right, we'll make it red.
NINOTCHKA	No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
LEON	Right: Lovers of the world unite!
NINOTCHKA	And we won't stretch up our arms...
LEON	No! No!
NINOTCHKA	...and we won't clench our fist...
LEON	No! No!
NINOTCHKA	Our salute will be a kiss.
LEON	Yes... a kiss... salute!

NINOTCHKA	I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
LEON	I know... it's the Russian soul.
NINOTCHKA	Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.

LEON	Would that make you any happier?
NINOTCHKA	Much happier.
LEON	All right.

NINOTCHKA	I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
LEON	Let's turn on the radio.
NINOTCHKA	Radio! What is radio?
LEON	It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
NINOTCHKA	Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...

LEON	What shall we get? The news!
NINOTCHKA	No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
LEON	Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
NINOTCHKA	Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...

NINOTCHKA	It's dead.
LEON	Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!

NINOTCHKA	No music.
LEON	No, no music.

NINOTCHKA	There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
LEON	But I can throw it out of the window.
NINOTCHKA	It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
LEON	...but big.
NINOTCHKA	...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
LEON	Who cried that one?
NINOTCHKA	Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
LEON	Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"

LEON	Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
NINOTCHKA	They belong to the people.
LEON	I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!

NINOTCHKA	Is this the wish of the masses?
LEON	It is their wish.
NINOTCHKA	Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
LEON	Please.

NINOTCHKA	Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
LEON	Yes, sweetheart. 
NINOTCHKA	So happy and so tired.

LEON	They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
NINOTCHKA	So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.

LEON	Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
NINOTCHKA	The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
LEON	I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.

NINOTCHKA	But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
LEON	If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
NINOTCHKA	Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.

SWANA	Hello, Leon!
LEON	Good morning, Swana.

SWANA	It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
LEON	Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
SWANA	Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
LEON	Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
SWANA	Did you win?
LEON	We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
SWANA	Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
LEON	We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
SWANA	Those newspaper people?
LEON	You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
SWANA	What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
LEON	Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
SWANA	Oh, Leon!
LEON	Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
SWANA	Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
LEON	I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
SWANA	Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!

SWANA	My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
LEON	Now, Swana...
SWANA	First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
LEON	Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
SWANA	Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."

LEON	I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
SWANA	A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
LEON	Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
SWANA	Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
LEON	Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!

SWANA	He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
LEON	Oh, yes.
SWANA	Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.

LEON	Did I hear something about jewels?
SWANA	Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!

SWANA	This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
LEON	What does he say?
SWANA	Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!

LEON	What did he say?
SWANA	It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
LEON	Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?

SWANA	Leon! What in heaven's name...!
LEON	Huh?
SWANA	Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
LEON	No.
SWANA	Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
LEON	I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
SWANA	Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.

LEON	Make it ice cold.
SWANA	Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.

SWANA	Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
LEON	Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
SWANA	You haven't seen her yet?
LEON	No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
SWANA	That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
LEON	That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
SWANA	You just told me you hadn't seen her.
LEON	Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
SWANA	Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
LEON	You can't imagine.
SWANA	That bad?  Old or young?
LEON	Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
SWANA	You saw all that in one glimpse?
LEON	Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
SWANA	Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.

LEON	Thank you.
SWANA	Is this your new dress suit?
LEON	Yes, Swana.
SWANA	Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
LEON	Yes, Swana, you did.
SWANA	It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
LEON	Yes, Swana.
SWANA	Am I interrupting?
LEON	Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
SWANA	How do you do?

SWANA	I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
LEON	No... please...

SWANA	He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
LEON	Months, Swana.
SWANA	Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.

LEON	There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
SWANA	I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?

LEON	Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
SWANA	A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?

SWANA	Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
LEON	No thanks, Swana.
SWANA	Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
LEON	I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
SWANA	Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
LEON	Yes.
SWANA	Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
LEON	This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
SWANA	All right, I'll listen.
LEON	I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
SWANA	Brutal frankness, if you insist.
LEON	There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
SWANA	And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
LEON	It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
SWANA	Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
LEON	I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
SWANA	Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
LEON	I'm afraid that's what it is.
SWANA	The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
LEON	What is this, Swana?
SWANA	Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
LEON	Has done what?
SWANA	She's gone, Leon.
LEON	Do you expect me to believe that?

SWANA	Hello, Leon darling!
LEON	Hello.
SWANA	After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.

LEON	Now, please, Swana.
SWANA	Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
LEON	That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
SWANA	Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chÃ¢teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
LEON	Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.

NINOTCHKA	Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
SWANA	Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.

SWANA	Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
NINOTCHKA	Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
SWANA	You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.

NINOTCHKA	You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
SWANA	It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.

SWANA	Good morning.
NINOTCHKA	What?
SWANA	It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.

NINOTCHKA	I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
SWANA	Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.

SWANA	How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
NINOTCHKA	If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
SWANA	Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
NINOTCHKA	Please come to the point. What is it you want?
SWANA	I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
NINOTCHKA	We have nothing to discuss.
SWANA	Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
NINOTCHKA	Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
SWANA	That's all right... I grow on people.
NINOTCHKA	I must ask you to leave.
SWANA	Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
NINOTCHKA	Madame, if you...
SWANA	Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
NINOTCHKA	If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?

SWANA	My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
NINOTCHKA	People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
SWANA	Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
NINOTCHKA	It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
SWANA	My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?

SWANA	You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
NINOTCHKA	I must insist that you leave.
SWANA	Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
NINOTCHKA	In that case I can only say good-by.

SWANA	I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
NINOTCHKA	I told you to go, madame.
SWANA	Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.

NINOTCHKA	Where are they?
SWANA	You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
NINOTCHKA	Where are they?
SWANA	Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
NINOTCHKA	You leave me no choice.
SWANA	Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
NINOTCHKA	I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
SWANA	That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!

NINOTCHKA	They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
SWANA	I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?

SWANA	Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
NINOTCHKA	In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
SWANA	Unfortunately.
NINOTCHKA	Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
SWANA	My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
NINOTCHKA	Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
SWANA	I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
NINOTCHKA	I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
SWANA	No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
NINOTCHKA	Go on.
SWANA	I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
NINOTCHKA	That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
SWANA	I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.

PORTER	Here, please...
NINOTCHKA	What do you want?
PORTER	May I have your bags, madame?
NINOTCHKA	Why?

PORTER	Well... that's my business, madame.
NINOTCHKA	That's no business... that's a social injustice.
PORTER	That depends on the tip.

RAZININ	Good morning, Comrade.
NINOTCHKA	Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
RAZININ	Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
NINOTCHKA	Yes, it does.
RAZININ	You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
NINOTCHKA	Yes.
RAZININ	That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
NINOTCHKA	I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
RAZININ	Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
NINOTCHKA	May I ask why?
RAZININ	Please... sit down.

RAZININ	Cigarette?
NINOTCHKA	Thank you.
RAZININ	Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
NINOTCHKA	No.
RAZININ	I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
NINOTCHKA	May I ask what has happened?
RAZININ	As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every cafÃ© and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"

NINOTCHKA	Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
RAZININ	It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
NINOTCHKA	You want me to go to Constantinople?
RAZININ	Yes... leaving immediately.
NINOTCHKA	I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
RAZININ	That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
NINOTCHKA	I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
RAZININ	I don't understand.
NINOTCHKA	How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
RAZININ	Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
NINOTCHKA	I will do my best.

PÃRE MATHIEU	This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
NINOTCHKA	This will do. 
PÃRE MATHIEU	I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
NINOTCHKA	Raw carrots and beets.
PÃRE MATHIEU	Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.

NINOTCHKA	Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
PÃRE MATHIEU	But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
NINOTCHKA	The future of the common people.
PÃRE MATHIEU	That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch Ã  la PÃ¨re Mathieu. 

TAXI DRIVER	Where to, madame?
NINOTCHKA	Can you recommend a restaurant?
TAXI DRIVER	Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
NINOTCHKA	Where do you eat?
TAXI DRIVER	At PÃ¨re Mathieu's.
NINOTCHKA	Where is that?
TAXI DRIVER	It's just a place for workmen.
NINOTCHKA	Where is it?
TAXI DRIVER	Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.

RAKONIN	Your Highness.
SWANA	How do you do, my friend.
RAKONIN	Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
SWANA	What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
RAKONIN	No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
SWANA	My jewels?!
RAKONIN	I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
SWANA	Why do you bring this up after so many years?
RAKONIN	They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
SWANA	Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
RAKONIN	This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!

RAKONIN	I am sorry... I have to leave.
SWANA	Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.

BIG DAN	I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
EVERETT	Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
BIG DAN	Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?

BIG DAN	Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
EVERETT	Our pleasure, Big Dan.
BIG DAN	And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; I generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. There are those who attempt both at the same time but I find it course and vulgar. Now where were we?

EVERETT	I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
BIG DAN	No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.

COOLEY	End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
EVERETT	Waitaminute -
COOLEY	- but now it deposits you here.

EVERETT	Waitaminute -
COOLEY	You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
EVERETT	You can't do this -
COOLEY	Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
EVERETT	Hang on there -
COOLEY	- and share one of your graves.
EVERETT	You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!

EVERETT	It ain't the law!
COOLEY	The law. Well the law is a human institution.

DELMAR	'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
PETE	How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?

PETE	We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
DELMAR	Gopher, Everett?

DELMAR	You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
PETE	You mis'able little sneak thief...

PETE	That's right!
DELMAR	That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
PETE	All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!

DELMAR	Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
PETE	Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.

DELMAR	Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
PETE	What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?

DELMAR	...Pete?
PETE	Do not seek the treasure!

DELMAR	We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
PETE	No, they never did turn me into a toad.
DELMAR	Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
PETE	Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
DELMAR	Huh?!
PETE	Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.

DELMAR	I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
PETE	Good Lord, what do we do?

DELMAR	How'd he know about the treasure?
EVERETT	Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-

DELMAR	What do we do now, Everett?
EVERETT	Fire! I hate fire!

EVERETT	NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
DELMAR	Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.

EVERETT	...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
DELMAR	Gopher, Everett?
EVERETT	And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.

DELMAR	Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
EVERETT	Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
DELMAR	Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
EVERETT	I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
DELMAR	Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!

DELMAR	But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
EVERETT	That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
DELMAR	You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.

EVERETT	Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
DELMAR	Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.

DELMAR	This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
EVERETT	What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?

DELMAR	Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
EVERETT	Four hundred, Delmar.
DELMAR	Izzat right?
EVERETT	What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?

DELMAR	Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
EVERETT	I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
DELMAR	Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
EVERETT	Where's Tommy?

DELMAR	Yeah, look at me.
EVERETT	Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...

DELMAR	Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
EVERETT	Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson.

EVERETT	Whuhh...
DELMAR	Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!

EVERETT	What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
DELMAR	Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!

EVERETT	...I'm not sure that's Pete.
DELMAR	Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!

EVERETT	You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed!
DELMAR	I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
EVERETT	Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-

DELMAR	Uh, we uh-
EVERETT	We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.

EVERETT	Pete have a brother?
DELMAR	Not that I'm aware.

EVERETT	Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
DELMAR	Okay, Everett.
EVERETT	Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
DELMAR	Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
EVERETT	Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
DELMAR	Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
EVERETT	Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...

DELMAR	So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
EVERETT	I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.

DELMAR	Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
EVERETT	Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!

EVERETT	It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
DELMAR	Oh my God!

DELMAR	'N turned into a frog -
EVERETT	He was never turned into a frog!

EVERETT	Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
DELMAR	Everett, my beard itches.

DELMAR	What sat mean exactly, Everett?
EVERETT	Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
DELMAR	Oh, okay.

EVERETT	I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
DELMAR	Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?

DELMAR	We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
EVERETT	Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -

DELMAR	A miracle! It was a miracle!
EVERETT	Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
DELMAR	That ain't it!

SPIVEY	Not out the other side his face, though.
ECKARD	Oh no, no, just the reg'la side -

PENNY	That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
EVERETT	Now Penny, stop that!
PENNY	No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
EVERETT	I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
PENNY	I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
EVERETT	...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!

PENNY	McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
EVERETT	Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.

EVERETT	Where's your ring, honey?
PENNY	I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
EVERETT	Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
PENNY	We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
EVERETT	Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
PENNY	Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
EVERETT	It's just a symbol, honey -
PENNY	No weddin'.

EVERETT	All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
PENNY	That's right, honey.
EVERETT	But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...

EVERETT	...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
PENNY	That's good, honey.
EVERETT	And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -

PENNY	That's not my ring.
EVERETT	- in the gods - Huh?
PENNY	That's not my ring.
EVERETT	Not your...
PENNY	That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
EVERETT	You said it was in the rolltop desk!
PENNY	I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
EVERETT	You said -
PENNY	Or, it might a been under the mattress.
EVERETT	You -
PENNY	Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.

EVERETT	Well, I'm sorry honey -
PENNY	Well, we need that ring.
EVERETT	Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
PENNY	Uh-huh.
EVERETT	A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
PENNY	I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
EVERETT	Yes, but honey -
PENNY	That wasn't my doing...

PENNY	I counted to three, honey.
EVERETT	Well sure, honey, but...

PETE	Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
EVERETT	Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
PETE	Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
EVERETT	Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!

EVERETT	Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty!
PETE	The hell you say! Wash is kin!

PETE	YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
EVERETT	Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!

PETE	Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
EVERETT	Don't I know it.
PETE	We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!

PETE	How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
EVERETT	Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.

PETE	To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
EVERETT	It was in his bureau.

EVERETT	Who was fixing to betray us!
PETE	You didn't know that at the time!
EVERETT	So I borrowed it till I did know!
PETE	That don't make no sense!
EVERETT	Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?

PETE	Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
EVERETT	Pete, don't be ignorant-

PETE	The preacher said it absolved us.
EVERETT	For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.

PETE	Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
EVERETT	Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.

PETE	A million dollars.
EVERETT	Million point two.

PETE	An' all my meals for free...
EVERETT	What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?

EVERETT	Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
PETE	Well that hardly sounds like you...

PETE	The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
EVERETT	Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.

EVERETT	Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
PETE	Isn't it, uh...

PETE	...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
EVERETT	...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...

PETE	It was a moment a weakness!
EVERETT	Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.

PETE	They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
EVERETT	I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.

PETE	It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
EVERETT	Aw, that's all right.

EVERETT	Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
PETE	I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
EVERETT	Well, but Pete...

EVERETT	Fact of the matter - there never was!
PETE	But... but...

PETE	But...
EVERETT	Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!

PETE	...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
EVERETT	I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
PETE	...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.

EVERETT	Pete... I do apologize.
PETE	Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!

EVERETT	Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
PETE	Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -

PETE	This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
EVERETT	No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!

PETE	We prayed to God and he pitied us!
EVERETT	It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
PETE	That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
EVERETT	Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...

EVERETT	Two weeks! That don't do me no good!
PROPRIETOR	Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

EVERETT	Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
PROPRIETOR	I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
EVERETT	No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
PROPRIETOR	Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
EVERETT	Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets!

EVERETT	Who's the honcho around here?
MAN	I am. Hur you?
EVERETT	Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
MAN	Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?

EVERETT	Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
MAN	Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
EVERETT	Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?

EVERETT	Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
MAN	Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
EVERETT	Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.

MAN	Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
FRENCH	How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
MAN	Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
FRENCH	They cut a record in here, few days ago, old-timey harmony thing with a guitar Accump-accump-uh-
MAN	Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
FRENCH	Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
MAN	It was a powerful air.
FRENCH	Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
MAN	Oh mercy, yes. You gotta beat that competition.

PAPPY	Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
JUNIOR	Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

PAPPY	...Yeah?
JUNIOR	Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.

PAPPY	I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
JUNIOR	We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
PAPPY	We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!

PAPPY	Holy-moly. These boys're a hit!
JUNIOR	But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
PAPPY	Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.

YOUNGEST	Daddy!
MIDDLE	He ain't our daddy!

MIDDLE	Mama said you was hit by a train!
YOUNGEST	Blooey!

MIDDLE	That's a maiden name.
YOUNGEST	You got a maiden name, Daddy?

YOUNGEST	It's bona fide!
MIDDLE	He's a suitor!

MIDDLE	She's at the five and dime.
YOUNGEST	Buyin' nipples!

BETTY	I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
JENNIFER	Thanks.

BETTY	I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
JENNIFER	Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
BETTY	Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.

BETTY	Mary Sue?
JENNIFER	Yeah?

BETTY	Can I ask you a question?
JENNIFER	Sure.

BETTY	What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
JENNIFER	What do you mean?
BETTY	Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
JENNIFER	Yeah ...  That--and ...

BETTY	What?
JENNIFER	It doesn't matter.
BETTY	No. I want to know.
JENNIFER	... Sex.
BETTY	Ah.

JENNIFER	You sure you want to know this?
BETTY	Yes.
JENNIFER	Okay.

BETTY	Yes ...  It's just that ...
JENNIFER	What?
BETTY	Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.

BETTY	Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
DAVID	We're in Pleasantville?

BETTY	Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
DAVID	It can't be possible.

BETTY	Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
DAVID	No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.

DAVID	Oh no ... I'm fine.
BETTY	How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
DAVID	I'm fine.

DAVID	It's okay. It's alright.
BETTY	I can't go out there. How can I go out there?

DAVID	Have you got any make up?
BETTY	In my handbag.

BETTY	Does it look okay?
DAVID	Looks just like it did.
BETTY	And they won't be able to tell?
DAVID	No ... They won't be able to tell.

DAVID	Wait.
BETTY	What?

BETTY	Thank you.
DAVID	Sure.

BETTY	I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
DAVID	Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
BETTY	I had to say goodbye.

BETTY	There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
DAVID	I won't.
BETTY	And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
DAVID	... It's a pretty short trip.

BETTY	I'm so proud of you, Bud.
DAVID	Thanks ... I love you.
BETTY	I love you too.

MR. JOHNSON	Oh, hello Betty.
BETTY	Hello Bill.

MR. JOHNSON	Oh, hi ...
BETTY	I'm sorry ...
MR. JOHNSON	No, no ... Come on in.

BETTY	I just thought ... It's beautiful.
MR. JOHNSON	Thanks.

MR. JOHNSON	Having kind of a tough time.
BETTY	I think it looks nice.
MR. JOHNSON	Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.

BETTY	Where'd you get this?
MR. JOHNSON	Bud brought it to me.
BETTY	Bud?
MR. JOHNSON	Here's my favorite.

MR. JOHNSON	Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
BETTY	She's crying.

MR. JOHNSON	What?
BETTY	She's crying.
MR. JOHNSON	No she's not.
BETTY	Yes she is.

MR. JOHNSON	Wait ...
BETTY	I've got to go ...
MR. JOHNSON	It's alright.

MR. JOHNSON	It's alright. Let me see.
BETTY	No ...

BETTY	What is that?
MR. JOHNSON	I don't know.

MR. JOHNSON	You can't go out there.
BETTY	But I really should get home.
MR. JOHNSON	But you can't go out there.

BETTY	Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
MR. JOHNSON	Yeah. It does.

BETTY	Like a drum.
MR. JOHNSON	Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...

BETTY	How was your day?
GEORGE	Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
BETTY	Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.

GEORGE	Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
BETTY	Oh, George ...
GEORGE	But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.

BETTY	I told you where I was.
GEORGE	All night?
BETTY	I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
GEORGE	I was in a bowling-alley.

GEORGE	Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
BETTY	I told you, George. I'm not going.
GEORGE	Sure you are.
BETTY	No I'm not.

BETTY	Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
GEORGE	It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
BETTY	I don't want to put on some make up ...

GEORGE	It goes away ... It'll go away.
BETTY	I don't want it to go away.

GEORGE	Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
BETTY	No I'm not sweetie.

BETTY	I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
GEORGE	Where are you gonna go?
BETTY	I'm gonna go now.

BIFF	What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
JENNIFER	Um ... It's ...

BIFF	I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
JENNIFER	Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.

BIFF	I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
JENNIFER	Really Biff? The keenest?
BIFF	Oh yeah.
JENNIFER	Gosh. I hardly know what to say.

BIFF	... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
JENNIFER	Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
BIFF	Hunh?  Oh, right ...

BIFF	So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
JENNIFER	Oh, gosh no.
BIFF	I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
JENNIFER	Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?

BIFF	Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
JENNIFER	You want to get out of here?
BIFF	What?
JENNIFER	You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
BIFF	But where would we go?
JENNIFER	... Lover's Lane.
BIFF	Lover's Lane!

BIFF	Sure is pretty.
JENNIFER	Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
BIFF	To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
JENNIFER	Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.

JENNIFER	... Why?
BIFF	I think ... I might be ill ...

JENNIFER	It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
BIFF	It is?
JENNIFER	Trust me ...

BIFF	Mary Sue--C'mon ...
JENNIFER	What are you doing?
BIFF	It's six-thirty ...
JENNIFER	So.
BIFF	We were gonna ... You know ...

JENNIFER	Oh.  I can't.
BIFF	Why not?

JENNIFER	I'm busy.
BIFF	With what?

JENNIFER	Don't! Just let go.
BIFF	It's better, Mary Sue.
JENNIFER	I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...

DAVID	Oh God! Are we in that episode?
BIFF	What?
DAVID	I don't believe it.
BIFF	What's the matter?
DAVID	You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
BIFF	Yeah ... How'd you know?
DAVID	Lucky guess.  Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...

DAVID	What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ...
BIFF	She won't go out with me?
DAVID	I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
BIFF	I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...

DAVID	What'll it be?
BIFF	Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.

DAVID	Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
BIG BOB	Okay, that's IT!!!
DAVID	Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?

DAVID	C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
BIG BOB	That's not going to happen!
DAVID	But it could happen.
BIG BOB	No it couldn't!

GEORGE	Want some bridge mix?
BOB	Oh, no thanks ...
GEORGE	Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
BOB	I'm fine--but thank you.

BOB	I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
GEORGE	Changes.
BOB	Changes.  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
GEORGE	No. What?
BOB	Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
GEORGE	One of those ... big beds?

GEORGE	Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
BOB	I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
GEORGE	... How?

BOB	No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
GEORGE	Thank you very much.
BOB	And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
GEORGE	No. Of course not.
BOB	And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
GEORGE	Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
BOB	Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
GEORGE	Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...

BOB	Are you alright?  What is it?
GEORGE	Rain.
BOB	Real rain?

BOB	What happened?
GEORGE	Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."

BOB	Did you do this?
DAVID	Yes I did.

BOB	Do you know that it's illegal?
DAVID	Yes I do.

BOB	BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
DAVID	Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.

BOB	You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
DAVID	Still doesn't make it right.

BOB	Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
DAVID	Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
BOB	We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary.

BOB	Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
DAVID	Well--it was dark out ...
BOB	Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
DAVID	It was accessible to everyone.
BOB	Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.

DAVID	I think I've got something to say.
BOB	Very well ...

DAVID	It's like the basketball team.
BOB	The basketball team?
DAVID	Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.

DAVID	See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
BOB	Okay--that's enough!
DAVID	I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
BOB	You're not allowed to lie.
DAVID	I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.

BOB	YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
DAVID	Why am I out of order?
BOB	BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
DAVID	Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.

BOB	THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
DAVID	But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
BOB	It's not in ME.
DAVID	Oh sure it is.
BOB	No it isn't.

BOB	Dan! Arrest them!
DAN	Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
BOB	What do you mean!?
DAN	Well, I never had to do it before.
BOB	You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
DAN	Oh. guess I could do that, then.

BOY	How'd you know about the fire?
DAVID	What?
BOY	How'd you know how to put it out and all?

BOY	And where's that?
DAVID	Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.

BOY	What's outside of Pleasantville?
DAVID	Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
BOY	What is it?

BOY	It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see.
DAVID	I thought the books were blank?

MR. SIMPSON	Hello Bud.
DAVID	Hello Mr. Simpson.
MR. SIMPSON	Hear your Dad got a new car.
DAVID	Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

DAVID	Mr. Simpson ...
MR. SIMPSON	Yes.
DAVID	What color is that hedge of yours?
MR. SIMPSON	Green.
DAVID	No, not that hedge. The other one.
MR. SIMPSON	The other one?
DAVID	The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.

JENNIFER	What are you doing?
DAVID	What are you doing?

JENNIFER	David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
DAVID	Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
JENNIFER	Pleasantville Marathon?
DAVID	Yeah. Every episode ever.
JENNIFER	Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
DAVID	Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
JENNIFER	Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!

DAVID	Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
JENNIFER	David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
DAVID	No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.

JENNIFER	Lemme see that.
DAVID	No way.

JENNIFER	Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
DAVID	Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.

JENNIFER	God, David. Just give it to me!
DAVID	Get lost!
JENNIFER	YOU get lost!

DAVID	Oh my God.
JENNIFER	What happened?
DAVID	I'm not sure.

JENNIFER	What did you do?
DAVID	I don't know.
JENNIFER	Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!

JENNIFER	Noooooo!
DAVID	You--you gotta get us out of here.

DAVID	Oh God.
JENNIFER	What's going to happen?
DAVID	I don't know ... It's not possible ...  Is it possible?

DAVID	I don't believe this.
JENNIFER	Neither do I.

JENNIFER	I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
DAVID	Just take deep breaths.
JENNIFER	All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.

JENNIFER	I still don't see why we're doing this.
DAVID	We're supposed to be in school.
JENNIFER	We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...

JENNIFER	You know him?
DAVID	Owns the hardware store.
JENNIFER	Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
DAVID	We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
JENNIFER	Play along?
DAVID	Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
JENNIFER	No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
DAVID	We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
JENNIFER	Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
DAVID	To who?

JENNIFER	Who's that?
DAVID	Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
JENNIFER	Does he--you know--like "me"?
DAVID	As a matter of fact he does.
JENNIFER	Hunh.

JENNIFER	Those are my friends.
DAVID	Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
JENNIFER	Can we do any better?
DAVID	I don't think so.

JENNIFER	No way.
DAVID	One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
JENNIFER	It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
DAVID	What?
JENNIFER	I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
DAVID	What were you doing in a library?
JENNIFER	I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!

DAVID	JENNIFER!
JENNIFER	Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...

DAVID	Jen, listen ...
JENNIFER	I like--really need a cigarette, too.
DAVID	I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.

JENNIFER	I could like kill a guy with these things.
DAVID	It's in your closet.
JENNIFER	I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
DAVID	He won't notice anyway.
JENNIFER	What do you mean?
DAVID	They don't notice that kind of thing.
JENNIFER	So what's the point?
DAVID	Jen please ...
JENNIFER	He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
DAVID	Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.

DAVID	Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
JENNIFER	Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?

DAVID	What did you do to him?
JENNIFER	Nothing.

DAVID	You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
JENNIFER	So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
DAVID	You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
JENNIFER	Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.

DAVID	You have no right to do this.
JENNIFER	Well if I don't who will?
DAVID	They're happy like this.
JENNIFER	David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?

JENNIFER	I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
DAVID	I just don't think we have the right to ...
JENNIFER	David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
DAVID	They don't have that kind of potential.
JENNIFER	Um--hello? You want to like take a look?

JENNIFER	Me too. Sounds swell.
DAVID	Really? It seems so fattening.

JENNIFER	I had nothing to do with that fire.
DAVID	It's okay.
JENNIFER	Not directly anyhow ...
DAVID	It's fine.

JENNIFER	Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
DAVID	Sure.

JENNIFER	Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
DAVID	The pages filled in?
JENNIFER	But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.

JENNIFER	What's wrong?
DAVID	Nothing.
JENNIFER	Nothing?

DAVID	You're reading?
JENNIFER	Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.

JENNIFER	D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
DAVID	... Yeah.
JENNIFER	Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
DAVID	That's great.

JENNIFER	So what is it?
DAVID	Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
JENNIFER	Sure.
DAVID	Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
JENNIFER	Yeah ...
DAVID	Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
JENNIFER	No. She really liked you.
DAVID	You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
JENNIFER	Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
DAVID	Wow.

JENNIFER	Can I ask you a question?
DAVID	Yes.
JENNIFER	How come I'm still in black and white?
DAVID	What?
JENNIFER	Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
DAVID	Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
JENNIFER	What?

DAVID	Are you sure?
JENNIFER	I told you. I'm like positive.
DAVID	This thing works. We could go home right now.
JENNIFER	I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.

JENNIFER	Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
DAVID	Honestly ... no.

DAVID	You got the admissions letter.
JENNIFER	Right here.
DAVID	And you're sure about this?
JENNIFER	I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.

MARGARET	That was sure swell ...
DAVID	Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
MARGARET	I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
DAVID	Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
MARGARET	No. I baked them for you.
DAVID	No. You baked them for Whitey.
MARGARET	No. I baked them for you.

MARGARET	Keeps going ...
DAVID	Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...

DAVID	Hi.
MARGARET	Oh ... Hi.
DAVID	Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...

MARGARET	Sure ... Where would we go?
DAVID	... Lover's Lane?

MARGARET	Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
DAVID	Oh ... Right.

DAVID	Mmmmgh.
MARGARET	Do they have those ... Where you come from?
DAVID	Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
MARGARET	You don't know?

MARGARET	So what's it like?
DAVID	What?
MARGARET	Out there.

MARGARET	How?
DAVID	Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
MARGARET	Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.

MARGARET	Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
DAVID	Yeah.
MARGARET	What's that like?
DAVID	Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
MARGARET	Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.

MARGARET	You want some berries?
DAVID	Hunh?

MARGARET	I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
DAVID	They just grow like that?
MARGARET	Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.

MARGARET	What's going on?
DAVID	Rain.
MARGARET	Real rain?
DAVID	Yeah ... You don't have rain either?

MARGARET	What do we do?
DAVID	We'll just put up the top.

MARGARET	It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
DAVID	It was a prop for the school play ...

MARGARET	Can I open it?
DAVID	Sure ...

MARGARET	Where are they?
DAVID	I'm not sure.

MARGARET	You're gonna forget about me.
DAVID	No I won't. I swear.

MARGARET	I like calling you David.
DAVID	I like it too.

HOWARD	Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
DAVID	Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?

DAVID	Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
HOWARD	Scout?
DAVID	Marmalade.

HOWARD	You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
DAVID	Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
HOWARD	A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
DAVID	Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.

DICK VAN DYKE	Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
DAVID	Yeah ... Sort of ...
DICK VAN DYKE	We'll get you fixed up in no time.

DICK VAN DYKE	I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
DAVID	You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
DICK VAN DYKE	Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?

DAVID	... Her father.
DICK VAN DYKE	Right. And how did she dress him?
DAVID	... Like Prince Charming.
DICK VAN DYKE	Nice ... Nice ...

DAVID	Yeah ...
DICK VAN DYKE	What department store did they go to?
DAVID	McIntire's.
DICK VAN DYKE	McGinty's.
DAVID	No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
DICK VAN DYKE	That's right.

DICK VAN DYKE	Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
DAVID	Ooomph?
DICK VAN DYKE	Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.

DAVID	How much does it cost?
DICK VAN DYKE	Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.

DICK VAN DYKE	... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
DAVID	What the hell's going on!
DICK VAN DYKE	Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...

DICK VAN DYKE	Why would I do that?
DAVID	Because we don't belong!
DICK VAN DYKE	Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
DAVID	My name's David.

DAVID	Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
DICK VAN DYKE	But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.

DAVID	Don't get upset.
DICK VAN DYKE	Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
DAVID	Where are you going ...
DICK VAN DYKE	I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
DAVID	WAIT A MINUTE!!
DICK VAN DYKE	Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
DAVID	COME BACK!!!

DICK VAN DYKE	Hello there.
DAVID	... Hi.
DICK VAN DYKE	Well c'mere, young fella.

DICK VAN DYKE	So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
DAVID	I can't.
DICK VAN DYKE	What?
DAVID	Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...

DICK VAN DYKE	Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
DAVID	Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
DICK VAN DYKE	I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
DAVID	Re-runs?
DICK VAN DYKE	Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
DAVID	Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
DICK VAN DYKE	Excuse me?
DAVID	Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
DICK VAN DYKE	BUD.
DAVID	Terrific. I'll talk to you then.

DICK VAN DYKE	I want a word with you ...
DAVID	Oh--well ...
DICK VAN DYKE	NOW!

DAVID	What do you mean?
DICK VAN DYKE	What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
DAVID	Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
DICK VAN DYKE	A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
DAVID	I had nothing to do with that.
DICK VAN DYKE	Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
DAVID	Look ...
DICK VAN DYKE	It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
DAVID	... Only if they mean it.

DICK VAN DYKE	OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!
DAVID	I didn't do anything wrong.
DICK VAN DYKE	Oh no? Let me show you something!

DICK VAN DYKE	Where's the remote control I gave you?
DAVID	Why?
DICK VAN DYKE	Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
DAVID	No you're not.
DICK VAN DYKE	EXCUSE ME?
DAVID	I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
DICK VAN DYKE	JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!

DICK VAN DYKE	OW!
DAVID	I'm going to leave now.
DICK VAN DYKE	You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!

DICK VAN DYKE	Hope you're proud of yourself.
DAVID	I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.

DICK VAN DYKE	Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
DAVID	Why?
DICK VAN DYKE	Because you're coming home.
DAVID	Why don't you just take me back without it?
DICK VAN DYKE	Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.

DAVID	So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
DICK VAN DYKE	Just gimme the damn remote!
DAVID	I'm sorry. I can't do that.

DICK VAN DYKE	I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
DAVID	They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.

DICK VAN DYKE	How long do you think you've been here?
DAVID	I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
DICK VAN DYKE	Much less than that.  An hour and a half.

DICK VAN DYKE	Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ...  Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
DAVID	I'm going on trial tomorrow?
DICK VAN DYKE	This is TV pal. They don't fool around.

DAVID	There's worse places.
DICK VAN DYKE	Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.

MR. JOHNSON	Bud?
DAVID	Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
MR. JOHNSON	Oh.

DAVID	What's wrong?
MR. JOHNSON	Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
DAVID	Yeah ...
MR. JOHNSON	But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.

DAVID	You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
MR. JOHNSON	I'm so glad you're here.
DAVID	I understand.

MR. JOHNSON	There aren't any cheeseburgers.
DAVID	What?
MR. JOHNSON	Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
DAVID	Listen to me!

DAVID	Do you have the lettuce?
MR. JOHNSON	... Yeah.
DAVID	Have you cooked the burgers?
MR. JOHNSON	Yes.
DAVID	Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.

DAVID	Oh hi!
MR. JOHNSON	Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
DAVID	Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.

MR. JOHNSON	Bud ...
DAVID	Yeah ...
MR. JOHNSON	You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
DAVID	Yeah ...
MR. JOHNSON	Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.

DAVID	Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
MR. JOHNSON	There aren't any cheeseburgers.
DAVID	Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
MR. JOHNSON	Oh--what's the point, Bud?

MR. JOHNSON	Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
DAVID	What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
MR. JOHNSON	No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
DAVID	Just listen to me ...
MR. JOHNSON	... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
DAVID	Forget about that!
MR. JOHNSON	Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.

DAVID	Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
MR. JOHNSON	Why?
DAVID	So they can have their hamburgers!

MR. JOHNSON	You know what I really like?
DAVID	... What's that?
MR. JOHNSON	Christmastime.

DAVID	Wow ... That's pretty good ...
MR. JOHNSON	Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"

MR. JOHNSON	Well don't you?
DAVID	I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
MR. JOHNSON	Really?
DAVID	Yeah.
MR. JOHNSON	Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.

MR. JOHNSON	Oh, hi.
DAVID	Hi.
MR. JOHNSON	Aren't you a little early?
DAVID	I brought you something ... From the library.

DAVID	It's an art book.
MR. JOHNSON	Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
DAVID	Open it.

DAVID	What's wrong?
MR. JOHNSON	I'll never be able to do that.
DAVID	Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
MR. JOHNSON	No, that's not it.

DAVID	It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
MR. JOHNSON	I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...

MR. JOHNSON	Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
DAVID	You're gonna keep painting aren't you?

DAVID	It's beautiful.
MR. JOHNSON	Just a little--You know.

DICK VAN DYKE	TV repair.
JENNIFER	TV repair?
DICK VAN DYKE	Yeah. TV busted?
JENNIFER	Yeah ...
DICK VAN DYKE	Well here I am.

JENNIFER	You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
DICK VAN DYKE	What's the rush?

DICK VAN DYKE	Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
JENNIFER	That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
DICK VAN DYKE	Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?

JENNIFER	Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
DICK VAN DYKE	Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?

JENNIFER	Free?
DICK VAN DYKE	Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.

DICK VAN DYKE	Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
JENNIFER	What happened?
DICK VAN DYKE	A miracle.

DICK VAN DYKE	Dream come true, hunh?
JENNIFER	This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
DICK VAN DYKE	Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.

JENNIFER	Oh GOD ...
DICK VAN DYKE	You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.

MARK	Hey.
JENNIFER	Hey.

MARK	Saw you at the mall yesterday.
JENNIFER	Yeah ... Saw you too.

JENNIFER	So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
MARK	Yeah. 

MARK	So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
JENNIFER	Cool.
MARK	Cool.

JACK	Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
CAMMI	It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
JACK	No, we're from San Diego. Why?
CAMMI	I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
JACK	Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
CAMMI	Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?

MAN	You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
CAMMI	I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.

MAN	You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
CAMMI	I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
MAN	And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
CAMMI	I liked it when you caught me fucking him.

MAN	The fuck was that?
CAMMI	The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!

JACK	Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
CHRISTINE	It'll just take a second.

JACK	It's Christine.  Hey you.
CHRISTINE	You guys having fun?

JACK	Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
CHRISTINE	Good. That's good.

JACK	So what's up?
CHRISTINE	Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?

CHRISTINE	Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
JACK	Well, then put him at the singles table.
CHRISTINE	The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
JACK	Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
CHRISTINE	Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
JACK	I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
CHRISTINE	I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
JACK	Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?

CHRISTINE	Why are you being so defensive?
JACK	I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
CHRISTINE	I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
JACK	Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
CHRISTINE	Bye.
JACK	I love you.
CHRISTINE	Bye.

EVELYN	Miles.
MILES	Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
EVELYN	How's the trip?
MILES	Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
EVELYN	Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
MILES	And?
EVELYN	And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
MILES	Huh.
EVELYN	I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.

EVELYN	Are you there? Miles?
MILES	Yeah, I'm here.
EVELYN	I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
MILES	So I guess that's it.
EVELYN	You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.

GARY	Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
MILES	Gary.
GARY	When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
MILES	Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
GARY	My condolences.
MILES	What are you pouring tonight?
GARY	Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
MILES	Absolutement.  They have their own label that's just outstanding.

GARY	What do you think?
MILES	Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.

GARY	How's it hanging, Miles?
MILES	You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
GARY	Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
MILES	Highliner.
GARY	Glass or bottle?
MILES	Bottle.
GARY	You got it.
MILES	Say, is Maya working?
GARY	Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?

GARY	You okay, Miles?
MILES	I'm good.

JACK	They're from both of us.
PHYLLIS	A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?

JACK	Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
PHYLLIS	Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
JACK	Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
PHYLLIS	If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
JACK	You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
PHYLLIS	Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?

JACK	Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
PHYLLIS	They're just leftovers.
JACK	Is it chicken?
PHYLLIS	I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.

PHYLLIS	And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
JACK	Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
PHYLLIS	Spray and Wash. That's the one.
JACK	Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
PHYLLIS	I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?

JACK	Two years ago, buddy.
PHYLLIS	You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.

PHYLLIS	She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
JACK	Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
PHYLLIS	I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?

STEPHANIE	Hey, guys. How's it going?
JACK	Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
STEPHANIE	That's what people say.

JACK	Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
STEPHANIE	Stephanie.
JACK	Nice.

JACK	Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
STEPHANIE	In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
JACK	Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
STEPHANIE	Oh yeah.
JACK	You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
STEPHANIE	Sure I know Maya. Real well.
JACK	No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.

JACK	You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
STEPHANIE	I know. I might need to be spanked.

JACK	How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
STEPHANIE	Good. How're you?
JACK	Great. You look great.  You both do.
STEPHANIE	Not so bad yourself.

STEPHANIE	I'm thinking about the duck breast.
JACK	Me too.

STEPHANIE	What happened to you guys?
JACK	Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.

JACK	Hi.
STEPHANIE	Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.

JACK	I can explain.
STEPHANIE	You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!

JACK	Hiya.
MAYA	Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.

MAYA	Highliner, please.
JACK	That's on us.

MAYA	Are you a writer too?
JACK	No, I'm an actor.
MAYA	Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
JACK	A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
MAYA	Anything I'd know?
JACK	Maybe. Recognize this?

MAYA	That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
JACK	I am one of those guys.
MAYA	You are not.

JACK	Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
MAYA	No, we're paying for the wine.
JACK	I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
MAYA	Well, in that case...

JACK	Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
MILES	I can't help the traffic.
JACK	Come on. You're fucking hungover.
MILES	Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.

MILES	Why did you tell them my book was being published?
JACK	You said you had it all lined up.
MILES	No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
JACK	Yeah, Conundrum.
MILES	...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
JACK	I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
MILES	It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.

MILES	Don't open that now. It's warm.
JACK	Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
MILES	That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!

JACK	Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
MILES	Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
JACK	Yeah.
MILES	You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.

JACK	Oh, that's tasty.
MILES	100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
JACK	Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
MILES	Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
JACK	Just tell me.
MILES	Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
JACK	Sure is tasty.

MILES	Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
JACK	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
MILES	And?
JACK	I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
MILES	How about the new ending? Did you like that?
JACK	Oh yeah. Much better.
MILES	There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
JACK	Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.

JACK	Whoa, why are we getting off?
MILES	I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
JACK	What?
MILES	I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
JACK	Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
MILES	It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.

JACK	How old's she going to be?
MILES	Um... seventy... something.
JACK	That's a good age.

MILES	Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
JACK	Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.

MILES	This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
JACK	And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.

JACK	Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
MILES	She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
JACK	That's your problem, Miles.
MILES	As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
JACK	Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
MILES	It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.

JACK	It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
MILES	I'd rather have a knife.
JACK	No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
MILES	I'm working on it.

JACK	You still seeing that shrink?
MILES	I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
JACK	Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
MILES	And Lexapro, yes.
JACK	Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
MILES	Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
JACK	And get your bone smooched.

MILES	You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
JACK	Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
MILES	These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
JACK	I thought you hated Chardonnay.
MILES	I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.

JACK	Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
MILES	Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.

MILES	So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
JACK	I told you. Filet and salmon.
MILES	Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
JACK	I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
MILES	Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
JACK	Let me call Christine.
MILES	Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
JACK	I owe her a call anyway.

JACK	Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
MILES	Now we're talking.

JACK	This is rose, right?
MILES	Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
JACK	Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.

MILES	First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
JACK	What color is it supposed to be?
MILES	Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
JACK	Huh.
MILES	Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.

MILES	What do you smell?
JACK	I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?

JACK	Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
MILES	Now set your glass down and get some air into it.

MILES	That's what you do with every one.
JACK	When do we get to drink it?
MILES	Now.

JACK	How would you rate this one?
MILES	Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?

JACK	You know, you could work in a wine store.
MILES	Yeah, that would be a good move.

MILES	Are you chewing gum?
JACK	Want some?

MILES	Hey Jack, hurry up!
JACK	Just a minute!

JACK	I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
MILES	It's not even a mile.
JACK	We should have driven.
MILES	Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
JACK	You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
MILES	Whoa.
JACK	Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
MILES	Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
JACK	Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
MILES	So you're going to stop acting?
JACK	No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
MILES	Uh-huh.
JACK	We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
MILES	If that's what feels right.
JACK	It does. Feels right.
MILES	Then it's a good thing.
JACK	Yeah. It's good. Feels good.

JACK	Yeah. Tight.
MILES	Pour us a couple.

JACK	Here's to my last week of freedom.
MILES	It's going to be great. Here's to us.

MILES	Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
JACK	You know her?
MILES	Sure I know Maya.
JACK	You know that chick?
MILES	Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
JACK	She is very hot.
MILES	And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.

JACK	Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
MILES	This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
JACK	So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
MILES	You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.

JACK	Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
MILES	Well, she does know a lot about wine.
JACK	Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
MILES	And she likes Pinot.
JACK	Perfect.
MILES	Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
JACK	Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
MILES	She works for tips!
JACK	You're blind, dude. Blind.

JACK	The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
MILES	Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
JACK	The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
MILES	Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
JACK	I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
MILES	Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
JACK	Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
MILES	How do you know?
JACK	No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.

JACK	Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
MILES	Shut up.
JACK	She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.

MILES	Have you no shame?
JACK	Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
MILES	Fuck you.

MILES	So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
JACK	So what's the plan today?
MILES	We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.

JACK	I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
MILES	Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
JACK	Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
MILES	Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
JACK	No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.

MILES	Nice, huh?
JACK	Beautiful.
MILES	Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
JACK	Miles.
MILES	She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
JACK	Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
MILES	I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
JACK	Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
MILES	She what?  When?
JACK	About a month ago. Six weeks.
MILES	To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...

JACK	Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
MILES	I want to go home now.
JACK	You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
MILES	Is she bringing him to the wedding?
JACK	What do you think?
MILES	You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
JACK	Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
MILES	I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
JACK	No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
MILES	You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?

MILES	You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
JACK	I'm a quick learner.

JACK	A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
MILES	Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?

JACK	Get the trunk.
MILES	You have the keys.

JACK	We're on.
MILES	What?
JACK	She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
MILES	With Maya?
JACK	Been divorced for a year now, bud.

JACK	Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
MILES	Well, she is cute.
JACK	Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.

JACK	You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
MILES	Nah. I want to watch this.

MILES	So what should I wear?
JACK	I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.

JACK	Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
MILES	Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
JACK	Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
MILES	Aye-aye, captain.
JACK	And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
MILES	If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
JACK	Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?

JACK	And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
MILES	Okay! Fuck!

JACK	Pull yourself together, man.
MILES	I'm fine!

JACK	Where were you?
MILES	Bathroom.
JACK	Did you drink and dial?

JACK	Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
MILES	Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
JACK	Oh Jesus, Miles.

JACK	And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
MILES	Shut up. Shut your face.
JACK	Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.

JACK	Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
MILES	Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.

JACK	Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
MILES	We were supposed to play golf.
JACK	You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
MILES	Count me out.
JACK	Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.

JACK	Later.
MILES	Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.

JACK	Oh, boy.
MILES	She's been leaving messages here too.
JACK	Yeah. Okay.

MILES	You should call her.
JACK	I will.  See ya!
MILES	Right now.
JACK	Okay! Jesus!

MILES	What'd Christine say?
JACK	Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.

JACK	Hey, there you are.
MILES	Yep.
JACK	What're you drinking?

MILES	Where is Stephanie?
JACK	Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
MILES	What the fuck are you doing?
JACK	What?
MILES	With this chick.

MILES	Does she know about Saturday?
JACK	Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...

MILES	Besides what?
JACK	Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
MILES	What?
JACK	Well, I've been doing some thinking.
MILES	Oh, you've been thinking. And?
JACK	I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.

JACK	Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
MILES	Deep.

JACK	I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
MILES	Understanding of what?
JACK	Like I might be in love with another woman.
MILES	In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
JACK	Look who's talking. You've been there.
MILES	Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
JACK	This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
MILES	And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
JACK	Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
MILES	You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
JACK	What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
MILES	What? Of course I like Christine.
JACK	You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
MILES	That was three years ago after that first party!
JACK	Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.

JACK	Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
MILES	Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.

JACK	Call me on my cell if you go out.
MILES	Yeah.

MILES	That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
JACK	She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!

JACK	Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
MILES	Nope.
JACK	She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
MILES	Can you give me some room here?
JACK	Oh yeah. Sure.

JACK	You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
MILES	Thanks, Jack.

JACK	Nice shot.
MILES	You're an asshole.

JACK	What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
MILES	Nope.
JACK	What do you think's going on?
MILES	Could be anything.
JACK	Been checking your messages?
MILES	Obsessively.
JACK	Huh.
MILES	They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
JACK	But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?

JACK	Don't come over the top. Stay still.
MILES	Shut up.
JACK	Just trying to be helpful.  It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.

MILES	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
JACK	Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.

MILES	What is it?
JACK	I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.

MILES	Fucker hit into us.
JACK	Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
MILES	Throw me his ball.

JACK	Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
MILES	I don't want to talk about it.
JACK	All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?

JACK	Is it the money thing?
MILES	Is what the money thing?
JACK	With Maya.
MILES	Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
JACK	Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
MILES	Slaughterhouse.
JACK	Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.

JACK	We're on.
MILES	What's happening?
JACK	We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
MILES	What exactly are we going to do?
JACK	I said okay?
MILES	You have to tell me --
JACK	I SAID OKAY?

JACK	You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
MILES	He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
JACK	Huh.

JACK	Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
MILES	Put me down, Jack.

JACK	So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
MILES	No.
JACK	What?
MILES	It's private.
JACK	You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
MILES	Let's leave it alone.

JACK	You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
MILES	Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
JACK	Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.

JACK	Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
MILES	Shut up! Shut up, Jack!

MILES	This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
JACK	Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
MILES	We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
JACK	I know what you need.

MILES	Do you like them?
JACK	Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
MILES	Are they too sporty?

JACK	How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
MILES	Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
JACK	You ever actually been in there, Miles?
MILES	I don't have to.
JACK	I say we check it out. You never know.

MILES	Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
JACK	I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
MILES	Let me use your phone.
JACK	What's up?
MILES	I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.

JACK	Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
MILES	No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
JACK	What's that supposed to mean?
MILES	You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
JACK	What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
MILES	Thanks.
JACK	Don't give up. You're going to make it.
MILES	Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
JACK	See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
MILES	Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.

MILES	Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
JACK	Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
MILES	No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
JACK	You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
MILES	Keep it elevated.

MILES	Well?
JACK	I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
MILES	Good thing you have a voice-over career.
JACK	Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
MILES	That's thoughtful.
JACK	Yeah.

JACK	So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
MILES	Huh. Let me think.
JACK	You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
MILES	Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.

JACK	What's it look like to you?
MILES	Looks like you were in a bad car accident.

JACK	You know what I'm thinking?
MILES	What's that?
JACK	I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
MILES	Uh-huh.

JACK	I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
MILES	I don't know. I wouldn't know.

JACK	She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
MILES	You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?

JACK	Fucking chick's married.
MILES	What?
JACK	Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
MILES	Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
JACK	Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
MILES	That's five clicks, Jackson.
JACK	Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.

JACK	We gotta go back.
MILES	What?
JACK	I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
MILES	Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
JACK	You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
MILES	Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
JACK	No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
MILES	No way. No way.
JACK	Please, Miles, please.
MILES	Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.

MILES	She tell you she was married?
JACK	Yeah.
MILES	So what the fuck were you thinking?
JACK	Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
MILES	Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
JACK	Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.

MILES	So what's the plan?
JACK	The plan is... you go.
MILES	Me?
JACK	My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
MILES	Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
JACK	Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.

JACK	Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
MILES	Hold on.

MILES	Hey, Jack. Jack.
JACK	Hrnrnrn?
MILES	That was quite a day yesterday.

JACK	Yep. Quite a day.
MILES	Quite a week.

JACK	Want me to drive?
MILES	No, I'm okay.
JACK	Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
MILES	Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
JACK	You're so negative.

JACK	Come on, let me drive.
MILES	I'm fine. You rest.
JACK	I feel like driving.

MILES	What's wrong?
JACK	Nothing. Buckle up, okay?

MILES	What the fuck!
JACK	You said it looked like a car accident.
MILES	What the fuck!
JACK	I'll pay for it.

MILES	Look at this!
JACK	I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
MILES	Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
JACK	You need a new car anyway.

MILES	You broke some.
JACK	Whatever. Sorry.
MILES	No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.

MILES	Well. That about does it.
JACK	Why don't you come in?
MILES	Uh-uh. You're on your own.
JACK	So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
MILES	Yeah.

JACK	Love you, man.
MILES	Back at you.

JACK	Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
MILES	Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
JACK	You were wearing your belt.

MAYA	Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
MILES	Maya, how are you?
MAYA	I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
MILES	Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
MAYA	Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
MILES	You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.

MILES	You want to join us?
MAYA	Sure.

MAYA	So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
MILES	I finished it.
MAYA	Good for you.

MAYA	Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
MILES	The Windmill.

MAYA	Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
MILES	See you.

MILES	What are you drinking?
MAYA	A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
MILES	Oh yeah? How is it?
MAYA	Try it.

MILES	Nice. Very nice.
MAYA	Twelve months in oak.
MILES	On a Sauvignon Blanc?
MAYA	I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
MILES	This is good. Little hints of clove.
MAYA	I know. I love that.

MAYA	I'm having the salmon.
MILES	That's what I'm having.

MAYA	Are you all right?
MILES	Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.

MILES	Hi.
MAYA	Hey.
MILES	She got anything good?
MAYA	Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?

MAYA	So what gems do you have in your collection?
MILES	Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
MAYA	You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...

MAYA	Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
MILES	Yeah, I know.
MAYA	It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
MILES	I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.

MAYA	The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
MILES	How long have you been into wine?
MAYA	I started to get serious about seven years ago.
MILES	What was the bottle that did it?
MAYA	Eighty-eight Sassicaia.

MILES	Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
MAYA	I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
MILES	Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.

MILES	Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
MAYA	Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
MILES	Is she sleeping or...?
MAYA	She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.

MAYA	You got kids?
MILES	Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
MAYA	Yeah, same here.

MAYA	It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
MILES	Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
MAYA	Yeah, weird. But great.
MILES	Yeah. Definitely.

MAYA	So what's your novel about?
MILES	Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
MAYA	What's the title?
MILES	The Day After Yesterday.
MAYA	Oh. You mean... today?
MILES	Um... yeah but it's more...
MAYA	So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
MILES	Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
MAYA	Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
MILES	Yeah. Thanks.
MAYA	Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
MILES	A paper?
MAYA	Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
MILES	Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
MAYA	I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
MILES	So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
MAYA	Well...
MILES	I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
MAYA	Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
MILES	My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
MAYA	Can I ask you a personal question?
MILES	Sure.
MAYA	Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.

MILES	I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
MAYA	What about me?
MILES	I don't know. Why are you into wine?
MAYA	I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
MILES	Yeah? Like what?
MAYA	Like what a fraud he was.

MILES	Bathroom over there?
MAYA	Yeah.

MAYA	You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
MILES	Got it.
MAYA	I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
MILES	Good. So did I.
MAYA	Okay. See you around.
MILES	Um... did you still want to read my novel?
MAYA	Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

MILES	Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
MAYA	Goodnight, Miles.

MAYA	Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
MILES	Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
MAYA	I had class.
MILES	Well, nice to see you now.
MAYA	You too.

MAYA	You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
MILES	Great. What's the latest we can get there?
MAYA	About two-thirty.
MILES	Okay.
MAYA	Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?

MILES	No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
MAYA	What rehearsal dinner?

MAYA	Were you ever going to say anything?
MILES	Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.

MILES	Maya.
MAYA	Don't touch me. Just take me home.

MILES	I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
MAYA	Do you know what he's been saying to her?
MILES	He's an actor, so it can't be good.
MAYA	Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
MILES	I'm sure he believed every word.

MILES	Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
MAYA	But you wanted to fuck me first.
MILES	Oh, Maya. No.
MAYA	Yeah.

MAYA	You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
MILES	And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.

MAYA	Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
MILES	It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

VICTORIA	Hello?
MILES	Victoria.
VICTORIA	Miles?

MILES	Victoria! How the hell are you?
VICTORIA	Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
MILES	Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
VICTORIA	Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
MILES	Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!

VICTORIA	Where are you?
MILES	A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.

MILES	Hello?
VICTORIA	Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
MILES	I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
VICTORIA	Ken.
MILES	Ken.
VICTORIA	Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
MILES	Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
VICTORIA	I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
MILES	You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.

MILES	I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
VICTORIA	Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.

MILES	Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
VICTORIA	Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.

MILES	That was big of him.
VICTORIA	Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
MILES	That's great.
VICTORIA	So how're you doing?
MILES	Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
VICTORIA	So what's happening with your book?
MILES	Universally rejected. Strike three.
VICTORIA	Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
MILES	Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
VICTORIA	I am.
MILES	Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
VICTORIA	I guess.

MILES	Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
VICTORIA	Not me. I'm not drinking.
MILES	You quit drinking?
VICTORIA	I'm pregnant.
MILES	Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
VICTORIA	See you over there, Miles.
MILES	Yeah.

MILES	How much skin and stem contact?
POURER	About four weeks.
MILES	Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
POURER	About a year.
MILES	French or American?
POURER	Both.
MILES	Good stuff.

MILES	Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
POURER	This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.

POURER	Sir, what are you doing?
MILES	I told you I need a drink.
POURER	Then buy a bottle and go outside.

STEPHANIE	So what do you think?
MILES	Quaffable but far from transcendent.

STEPHANIE	Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
MILES	Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --

STEPHANIE	What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
MILES	Exactement!

MILES	Should we get dessert?
STEPHANIE	We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.

STEPHANIE	Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
MILES	She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.

STEPHANIE	That was fun last night.
MILES	Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
STEPHANIE	Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.

STEPHANIE	Where's Jack?
MILES	He had to make a phone call.

STEPHANIE	So what are you up to today, Miles?
MILES	Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
STEPHANIE	Huh.
MILES	Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
STEPHANIE	Oops. Sorry.
MILES	You golf?
STEPHANIE	Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
MILES	Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.

STEPHANIE	Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
MILES	Where?

STEPHANIE	See you, Miles. You take care.
MILES	Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.

MILES	Stephanie! Stop!
STEPHANIE	You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?

MILES	A famous actor who's getting married next week.
PHYLLIS	Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.

MILES	It was a surprise, Mom.
PHYLLIS	And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.

MILES	You talked to Wendy?
PHYLLIS	Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
MILES	Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
PHYLLIS	Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
MILES	Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.

PHYLLIS	Miles, when are you going to get married again?
MILES	I just got divorced. Phyllis.

ANSWERING MACHINE	Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
MIKE	Shit.
ANSWERING MACHINE	You have to put things in perspective.
MIKE	I know, I know.
ANSWERING MACHINE	You've been through worse.
MIKE	You're right. I know.
ANSWERING MACHINE	Ever since I've known you.
MIKE	I don't know about that.
ANSWERING MACHINE	Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
MIKE	It didn't feel that way.
ANSWERING MACHINE	That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
MIKE	Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
ANSWERING MACHINE	You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
MIKE	Enough. I've got to use the phone.
ANSWERING MACHINE	Are you calling Her?
MIKE	No. Stop, come on.

ANSWERING MACHINE	You should call your Grandmother.
MIKE	Shuddup.

ANSWERING MACHINE	Don't do it, Mike.
MIKE	Shut up.

MIKE	Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
ANSWERING MACHINE	You're money, baby.

MIKE	How are you ladies doing this evening?
BLONDE	What do you drive?
MIKE	I'm sorry?
BLONDE	What kind of car do you drive?
MIKE	Oh... a Cavalier.

MIKE	You like laughing at the misery of others?
BLONDE	I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.

MIKE	Thanks.
BLONDE	I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
MIKE	You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
BLONDE	...maybe...
MIKE	...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
BLONDE	You're a comedian?
MIKE	Yeah.
BLONDE	What's that like?
MIKE	Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
BLONDE	I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
MIKE	Are you sure? Maybe...
BLONDE	Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
MIKE	Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
BLONDE	I'd say about two weeks.
MIKE	Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
BLONDE	You better pay the man.

MIKE	Well, thank you...?
BLONDE	Nikki.
MIKE	Thank you, Nikki.

MIKE	Hi.
BRUNETTE	Hi.
MIKE	I'm Mike.
BRUNETTE	Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
MIKE	Like the quiche?
BRUNETTE	Yes. Like the quiche.
MIKE	I like quiche.
BRUNETTE	I thought real men don't like quiche.
MIKE	My reputation seems to have preceded me.
BRUNETTE	Why? You're not a real man?
MIKE	Not lately.

BRUNETTE	...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
MIKE	Just like that?
BRUNETTE	Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
MIKE	How was it hard?
BRUNETTE	Well, I left someone very special behind.
MIKE	Tell me about it...
BRUNETTE	You too?
MIKE	Yeah.
BRUNETTE	I thought I was going to die.
MIKE	It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
BRUNETTE	Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
MIKE	It does.
BRUNETTE	How?
MIKE	Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
BRUNETTE	Like what?
MIKE	What what? What advantages?

BRUNETTE	What else?
MIKE	What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
BRUNETTE	To do what?
MIKE	I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
BRUNETTE	Anything?
MIKE	Anything.
BRUNETTE	Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
MIKE	Uh, if the guy wants to.
BRUNETTE	You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
MIKE	Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
BRUNETTE	Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
MIKE	No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
BRUNETTE	Mike...

MIKE	Charles! What's up, man?
CHARLES	Oh. You know.
MIKE	Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
CHARLES	No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
MIKE	...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.

MIKE	...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
CHARLES	I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
MIKE	...not until you book it...
CHARLES	...and even then...
MIKE	...you might get cut out.

MIKE	You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
CHARLES	Why not? This place is dead anyway.

CHARLES	They're out of Glenlivet.
MIKE	What else is going on?

MIKE	Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
CHARLES	...then ask where you met her...
MIKE	Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"?

CHARLES	Hi.
ROB	My pleasure.

CHARLES	Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
ROB	I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
CHARLES	You haven't told then, huh?
ROB	No.
CHARLES	I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...

ROB	I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
CHARLES	Hey, man. At least it's Disney.

CHARLES	...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
ROB	...Four days..?

CHARLES	I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
ROB	...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...

CHRISTY	Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
TRENT	Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
CHRISTY	Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...

TRENT	No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
CHRISTY	They were auditioning for the same role as you?
TRENT	Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...

TRENT	It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
CHRISTY	What an asshole.

TRENT	Let me just check on my boy.
CHRISTY	Don't worry. He's in good hands.

CHRISTY	Always...
LISA	No matter what... like splitting aces.

CHRISTY	Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
LISA	I'm a "Dorothy".

LISA	Oh my God.
CHRISTY	Did you get it?

CHRISTY	The poor thing. Six years?
LISA	...And she's with someone else.
CHRISTY	The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.

CHRISTY	He's so sweet. He really said that?
LISA	I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
CHRISTY	He is so sweet.

CHRISTY	A couple of high rollers like you?
MIKE	Could you believe it?
CHRISTY	Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
MIKE	Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
CHRISTY	Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
MIKE	No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.

CHRISTY	What do you guys do?
MIKE	I'm a comedian.

DEALER	On the table.
MIKE	Sorry?
DEALER	You have to lay it on the table.
MIKE	Uh, I don't want to bet it all.

DEALER	You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
MIKE	Oh... right.

MIKE	Huh?
DEALER	You want this in black chips.
MIKE	Sure, that'll be fine.

MIKE	Do you have anything smaller?
DEALER	Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.

LISA	Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
MIKE	No...
LISA	You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
MIKE	Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
LISA	Why not?
MIKE	There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
LISA	Who's your booking agent?
MIKE	Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
LISA	Well, who represents you back east?
MIKE	Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
LISA	What do you do, Trent?

LISA	I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
MIKE	I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
LISA	Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
MIKE	Why not?
LISA	It's a rebound.
MIKE	We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
LISA	Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
MIKE	Six years.

MIKE	Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
LISA	Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.

MIKE	Sorry, it's just that...
LISA	I understand.

LORRAINE	You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
MIKE	Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.

LORRAINE	Well... This is it.
MIKE	Listen. I had a great time.
LORRAINE	Me too.
MIKE	I would love to see you again sometime.
LORRAINE	I'll be around.
MIKE	That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
LORRAINE	Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?

LORRAINE	You're a comedian?
MIKE	Yeah. And an actor.
LORRAINE	I'll have to come see you sometime.
MIKE	If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
LORRAINE	It's not going to well?
MIKE	When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
LORRAINE	Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
MIKE	...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
LORRAINE	Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
MIKE	Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
LORRAINE	Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
MIKE	Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
LORRAINE	Hey, at least it's not Goofy.

LORRAINE	Well, I should be getting...
MIKE	...It's really getting late.
LORRAINE	...home. It's getting late. Yeah.

LORRAINE	Can I give you a ride to your car...?
MIKE	...Nah. I'm right across the street...
LORRAINE	...Which one...?
MIKE	...The red piece of shit over there...
LORRAINE	...well, it suits you...
MIKE	...get the hell outta here already...

MIKE	Hello?
LORRAINE	Hi, Mike?
MIKE	Lorraine?
LORRAINE	Are you on the other line?
MIKE	Yeah, hold on.
LORRAINE	I can call back...
MIKE	No, no. Hold on.

MIKE	Hi. Sorry about that.
LORRAINE	You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
MIKE	That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.

MIKE	Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
LORRAINE	Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...

MICHELLE	How's it going? It's been a while...
MIKE	...Six months.
MICHELLE	How are you doing?
MIKE	Fine... I guess. You?
MICHELLE	Good.  I think about things.
MIKE	Yeah?
MICHELLE	Yeah.
MIKE	What kind of things?
MICHELLE	You know, us.
MIKE	I thought you met someone else.
MICHELLE	It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
MIKE	Really?
MICHELLE	I miss you, Mike.
MIKE	Why didn't you call?
MICHELLE	I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
MIKE	...the Michelin commercial...
MICHELLE	...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
MIKE	Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
MICHELLE	No, he's not... Listen I don't want to talk about him. That's a whole other headache. I called because I heard you might be moving back to Queens...

MIKE	Hi.
MICHELLE	I heard you might be moving back...
MIKE	Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
MICHELLE	I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
MIKE	I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
MICHELLE	Goodbye. I lov... 

MIKE	And what if I don't want to give up on her?
ROB	You don't call.
MIKE	But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
ROB	Right.
MIKE	So I don't call either way.
ROB	Right.
MIKE	So what's the difference?
ROB	The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
MIKE	So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
ROB	Right.
MIKE	Well that sucks.
ROB	It sucks.
MIKE	So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
ROB	Right... or more likely the opposite.
MIKE	Right... Wait, what do you mean?
ROB	I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
MIKE	Unless she comes back first.
ROB	Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
MIKE	There's the rub.
ROB	There's the rub.
MIKE	Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
ROB	Hey man, don't sweat it.
MIKE	...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
ROB	No problem.
MIKE	Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
ROB	Thanks. Thanks, man.

ROB	I don't think I'm gonna take it.
MIKE	It's a gig.
ROB	I mean, I need the money.
MIKE	You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
ROB	It's definitely a step back for me.
MIKE	Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
ROB	There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
MIKE	What do you want? You're tall.
ROB	Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
MIKE	You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
ROB	It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."

MIKE	Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
ROB	I didn't want to say anything.
MIKE	Why?
ROB	I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
MIKE	What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
ROB	Kinda.
MIKE	I don't talk about her that much.
ROB	Oh no?
MIKE	I didn't mention her once today.
ROB	Well, until now. Tend the pin.

MIKE	The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
ROB	I do. Good for you, man.
MIKE	I've decided to get out there.  Go ahead. Play it out.

MIKE	You want to hit the town tonight?
ROB	I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
MIKE	What do you have? A Pluto call back?
ROB	Sure. Kick me when I'm down.

ROB	How many strokes?
MIKE	I don't know. Eight or Nine.
ROB	I'll give you an eight. 
MIKE	What'd you get?
ROB	An eight.
MIKE	Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.

ROB	So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
MIKE	To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
ROB	Oh.  Where is this place?
MIKE	It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
ROB	That doesn't sound too good for business.
MIKE	It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
ROB	Sounds more like Aids...
MIKE	...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.

MIKE	Kinda money, huh?
ROB	Classy.

MIKE	I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
ROB	Bud.
MIKE	...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.

ROB	I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
MIKE	I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
ROB	Darwinism at its best.
MIKE	I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
ROB	It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
MIKE	Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
ROB	I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
MIKE	Ah, there's the rub...
ROB	There's the rub.

MIKE	Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
ROB	I just tested for one...
MIKE	...yeah, a month ago.

ROB	...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
MIKE	Well, let's hit that party.

ROB	What's that guy's name? Sue?
MIKE	Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
ROB	Oh, like that song...
MIKE	..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
ROB	Him?
MIKE	He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.

MIKE	There are so many beautiful women here.
ROB	It's unbelievable.
MIKE	I got to at least try once.
ROB	You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
MIKE	No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
ROB	Go for it, man.

MIKE	I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
ROB	I'll be your winger.

MIKE	Thanks, man.
ROB	No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?

ROB	You haven't been drinking, have you?
MIKE	No. Just O.J.

MIKE	Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
ROB	Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.

ROB	You want to talk about it?
MIKE	What's the point?
ROB	It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...

MIKE	Uuuuugh!
ROB	Oh boy.
MIKE	I'm such an asshole.
ROB	She wasn't your type anyway.

MIKE	I think I'm gonna move Back East.
ROB	Well, that's dumb.
MIKE	What's dumb about it?
ROB	Well, you're doing so well...
MIKE	How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
ROB	At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
MIKE	They turned you down?
ROB	They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.

ROB	See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
MIKE	I didn't make it...
ROB	That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".

MIKE	Then why won't she call...?
ROB	Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
MIKE	How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
ROB	Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.

MIKE	You miss the pain?
ROB	...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
MIKE	Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
ROB	Sure.

ROB	By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
MIKE	You always know the right thing to say.

SUE	You little bitch!
MIKE	Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.

MIKE	You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
SUE	Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.

SUE	It's kinda money, actually.
MIKE	Make someone bleed.
SUE	No, man, we're in the play-offs.

SUE	Pause it. 
MIKE	Give me the money. I'll get it.

SUE	...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
MIKE	So, what? Eleven?

SUE	What's he do?
MIKE	He's trying to be an actor.

MIKE	...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
SUE	...He's derivative...

MIKE	Who threw this party, anyway?
SUE	Damned if I know...

SUE	How's it going for you two?
MIKE	Not well.
SUE	Rejected?

SUE	Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
MIKE	I can't believe you.

SUE	She was cute.
MIKE	She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...

SUE	He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
MIKE	You asshole.

MIKE	You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
SUE	Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...

MIKE	Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
SUE	...People get carjacked...

MIKE	You live in such a fantasy world...
SUE	What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
MIKE	...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
SUE	...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...

SUE	I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
MIKE	What are they doing here?
SUE	We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.

SUE	But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
MIKE	Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
SUE	Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
MIKE	Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?

SUE	Good for you, man. He's being smart.
MIKE	She's really special, guys.

NIKKI	Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
MIKE	Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 

NIKKI	Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
MIKE	Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 

NIKKI	Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
MIKE	213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 

NIKKI	Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
MIKE	I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 

NIKKI	Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
MIKE	Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 

NIKKI	Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
MIKE	Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
NIKKI	Mike?
MIKE	Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
NIKKI	Don't call me ever again.
MIKE	Wow, I guess you were home... 

WAITRESS	There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
MIKE	Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.

WAITRESS	Are you ready to order?
MIKE	Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
WAITRESS	That's right.
MIKE	I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".

MIKE	Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
WAITRESS	Hang on, Voltaire.

TRENT	Hello?
MIKE	S'up Trent?
TRENT	Lemme get off the other line, baby.

TRENT	That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
MIKE	I don't know...
TRENT	Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
MIKE	Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
TRENT	Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
MIKE	I don't know...
TRENT	I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
MIKE	We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
TRENT	You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
MIKE	What are you talking about? Vegas?
TRENT	VEGAS.
MIKE	What Vegas?
TRENT	We're going to Vegas.
MIKE	When?
TRENT	Tonight, baby.
MIKE	You're crazy.
TRENT	I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
MIKE	I'm not going to Vegas.
TRENT	Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.

MIKE	I can't lose more than a hundred.
TRENT	Just bring your card. Half an hour.
MIKE	Wait.
TRENT	What?
MIKE	What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
TRENT	Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
MIKE	No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
TRENT	Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
MIKE	Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
TRENT	Be downstairs. You're beautiful.

MIKE	I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
TRENT	I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
MIKE	I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
TRENT	I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
MIKE	Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
TRENT	Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
MIKE	Vegas!

TRENT	Vegas, baby!
MIKE	Vegas!

TRENT	Vegas.
MIKE	Vegas.

TRENT	Wake up, baby.
MIKE	Whu?
TRENT	Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!

MIKE	Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
TRENT	This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
MIKE	This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
TRENT	You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.

MIKE	This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
TRENT	That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
MIKE	They're all skanks.
TRENT	Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
MIKE	Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
TRENT	What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.

MIKE	Cut that shit out.
TRENT	She smiled baby.
MIKE	That's not cool.
TRENT	Did she, or did she not smile?
MIKE	It doesn't matter...
TRENT	I'm telling you, they love that shit.
MIKE	You're gonna screw up our plan.
TRENT	We're gonna get laid, baby.
MIKE	First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
TRENT	What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
MIKE	Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
TRENT	Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
MIKE	The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
TRENT	Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.

MIKE	That's where we make our scene.
TRENT	You think they're watching?
MIKE	Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.

TRENT	Double down.
MIKE	What?!?
TRENT	Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
MIKE	I know, but...
TRENT	You gotta do it.
MIKE	...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
TRENT	If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...

TRENT	I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
MIKE	Yeah? Well obviously not always!
TRENT	Always, baby.
MIKE	I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
TRENT	Always.
MIKE	But I lost! How can you say always?!?

TRENT	...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
MIKE	Thanks for clarifying that.
TRENT	Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
MIKE	Yea, how much?
TRENT	I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
MIKE	Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
TRENT	Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
MIKE	You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
TRENT	Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
MIKE	Let's just leave.
TRENT	Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
MIKE	Let's go.
TRENT	Who's the big winner?

TRENT	Mikey's the big winner.
MIKE	What an asshole.
TRENT	Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.

MIKE	What an asshole.
TRENT	That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
MIKE	That was so demeaning...
TRENT	She smiled, baby.
MIKE	I can't believe what an asshole you are.
TRENT	Did she, or did she not smile.
MIKE	She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
TRENT	She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
MIKE	Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
TRENT	Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
MIKE	What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
TRENT	I know she's coming back.
MIKE	I don't think so.
TRENT	Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
MIKE	You think so?
TRENT	You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
MIKE	I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
TRENT	Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
MIKE	She likes you.
TRENT	Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
MIKE	I don't know...
TRENT	You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
MIKE	That's bullshit.
TRENT	It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
MIKE	It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
TRENT	You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
MIKE	It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
TRENT	...gotta...
MIKE	...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
TRENT	Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...

MIKE	That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
TRENT	That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
MIKE	I know. I know.
TRENT	They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
MIKE	I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
TRENT	Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.

TRENT	Nice, baby.
MIKE	I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
TRENT	Baby, you did fine.
MIKE	Age of Enlightenment. Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
TRENT	...Baby...
MIKE	...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
TRENT	You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
MIKE	I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
TRENT	Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
MIKE	We didn't do so bad after all.
TRENT	Baby, we're money.

MIKE	I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
TRENT	Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?

MIKE	Whatever.
TRENT	Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.

TRENT	Oh... a Dorothy.
MIKE	Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.

MIKE	What was the part?
TRENT	Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
MIKE	Big Brother, "Little Brother"?
TRENT	Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
MIKE	No!
TRENT	Yes!

TRENT	Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
MIKE	No! Not the camera guy!
TRENT	I'm telling you!

MIKE	...So give me the fuckin part...
TRENT	Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
MIKE	So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?

MIKE	No, man. I need to use the phone.
TRENT	What?
MIKE	I gotta use the phone.
TRENT	Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
MIKE	Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
TRENT	Hold on.

MIKE	She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
TRENT	You didn't have to get into it, baby.
MIKE	Sorry about interrupting...
TRENT	Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
MIKE	Christy was nice...
TRENT	I didn't even like her, to be honest.
MIKE	She was hot.
TRENT	She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
MIKE	I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
TRENT	No, baby. You're money.
MIKE	She didn't like me, anyway.
TRENT	She thought you were money.
MIKE	I don't think so.
TRENT	I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
MIKE	Yeah, a good friend.
TRENT	Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
MIKE	I just don't think she liked me in that way.
TRENT	Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
MIKE	Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
TRENT	Michelle went for you, right.
MIKE	That was different.
TRENT	How?
MIKE	I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
TRENT	That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
MIKE	I just need some time...
TRENT	Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
MIKE	Don't remind me.
TRENT	You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
MIKE	...a day...
TRENT	...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
MIKE	Selling scrap metal.
TRENT	See? And what does this guy she's with do?
MIKE	He drives a carriage.
TRENT	What?!?
MIKE	I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
TRENT	Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
MIKE	I hear she's getting real fat.
TRENT	Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.

TRENT	I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
MIKE	This version doesn't have fighting?
TRENT	No. Doesn't that suck?
MIKE	What? That was the best part of the old game.

MIKE	No.
TRENT	Yeah.

MIKE	You guys are such assholes.
TRENT	Aww... He got away?

MIKE	What time's this party tonight?
TRENT	It starts at eight...

TRENT	Who? Rob?
MIKE	Yeah. You met him once.
TRENT	Yeah. He's a "rounder".

MIKE	...the Copa, in New York...
TRENT	...through the kitchen...

MIKE	...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
TRENT	...It looked money.

MIKE	How you guys doing?
TRENT	It's on.
MIKE	Which one?
TRENT	Minnie Pearl.

TRENT	What are you doing?
MIKE	What?
TRENT	You looked right at her, baby.
MIKE	She didn't notice.

MIKE	I'm sorry.
TRENT	Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.

TRENT	Was I money?
MIKE	I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
TRENT	Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
MIKE	You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
TRENT	She didn't see.
MIKE	That doesn't matter.

TRENT	We got the digits, baby.
MIKE	What a surprise.
TRENT	What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.

MIKE	Please, don't mess with me right now...
TRENT	We're not messing with you...

MIKE	You're not just, like, fucking with me?
TRENT	No, baby!

MIKE	How long do I wait to call?
TRENT	A day.
MIKE	Tomorrow?
TRENT	No...

MIKE	So, two days?
TRENT	Yeah. I guess you could call it that.

TRENT	What the fuck..?
MIKE	What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.

TRENT	You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
MIKE	I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
TRENT	You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?

MIKE	It's not like that...
TRENT	Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
MIKE	I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.

MIKE	Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
TRENT	Oh. He's got it under control...

SUE	Bitch... You little bitch!
TRENT	Chelios to Roenick...!

TRENT	Because he's a bitch.
SUE	That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.

TRENT	...against the computer.
SUE	They're a finesse team...
TRENT	They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
SUE	Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!

SUE	I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
TRENT	You could make their heads bleed, though.
SUE	Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.

TRENT	Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
SUE	...Is he brown?

TRENT	What a surprise...
SUE	...How novel.

TRENT	Oh, it's on, baby...
SUE	...It's on.

TRENT	Is she looking at me, baby?
SUE	No.
TRENT	Now?
SUE	No.
TRENT	Is she looking now?
SUE	No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
TRENT	See, baby?

SUE	Yes she did.
TRENT	Damn. Now I gotta go in early.

SUE	That was pretty cold, dude.
TRENT	What was cold about it?

TRENT	It's on.
SUE	You think?
TRENT	Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
SUE	...double diamond...
TRENT	...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
SUE	True.

TRENT	Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
SUE	You are so money, and you don't even know it...
TRENT	That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...

SUE	...we're not...
TRENT	You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
SUE	...and big fuckin' teeth...
TRENT	...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
SUE	...shivering...
TRENT	...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
SUE	...You're just poking at it...
TRENT	...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
SUE	...and you got big claws and fangs...
TRENT	...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
SUE	...you're like a big bear.

SUE	...honestly...
TRENT	...you're money...
SUE	...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
TRENT	Now go over there and get those digits.
SUE	You're money.
TRENT	Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.

SUE	...Tomorrow, then a day.
TRENT	...Yeah.

SUE	Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
TRENT	...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
SUE	...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
TRENT	Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...

TRENT	Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
SUE	Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.

TRENT	You dick.
SUE	What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.

TRENT	...Anaheim...
SUE	...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.

TRENT	...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
SUE	Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
TRENT	...Oh yeah, like "Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything...

TRENT	...Sue...
SUE	Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
TRENT	...Shut up, Sue...
SUE	I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
TRENT	Sue!

TRENT	It's on...
SUE	...it's on.

TRENT	It's on.
SUE	...it's definitely on.

SUE	It is on.
TRENT	...it is so on.

SUE	Sorry man.
TRENT	Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
SUE	...Definitely...

TRENT	The bear's got his claws back.
SUE	Be smart about it.
TRENT	I'm telling you. Wait three days...
SUE	You don't have to wait three days...
TRENT	...Okay, two...
SUE	...just be smart about it.

SUE	...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
TRENT	Our little baby's growing up...

TRENT	...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
WAITRESS	Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
TRENT	Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
WAITRESS	Six.

WAITRESS	And you?
TRENT	I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
WAITRESS	I'll be back with the coffee.

VERNON	I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
CRABTREE	That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
VERNON	Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
CRABTREE	Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
VERNON	He was trying to steal my car!

CRABTREE	What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
VERNON	Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?

JAMES LEER	That's just how my brain works, I guess.
CRABTREE	Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
JAMES LEER	Actually... I just want to go home.
CRABTREE	Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.

CRABTREE	He's fine. He's narrating.
JAMES LEER	We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.

JAMES LEER	Hey. What are you guys doing here?
CRABTREE	We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.

CRABTREE	I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
JAMES LEER	The candelabras were my Gran's.

JAMES LEER	You all right, Professor Tripp?
CRABTREE	He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
JAMES LEER	Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
CRABTREE	Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
JAMES LEER	Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.

JAMES LEER	You snore.
CRABTREE	So I hear.
JAMES LEER	No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
CRABTREE	He's right, you look horrible.

JAMES LEER	It's the Chancellor.
CRABTREE	Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.

JAMES LEER	Thank you.
CRABTREE	You're welcome.

CRABTREE	Tripp!
GRADY	How are you, Crabtree?
CRABTREE	Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...

CRABTREE	I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
GRADY	I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.

GRADY	Emily?
CRABTREE	Your wife.
GRADY	Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
CRABTREE	Perfect. Well then, shall we?

CRABTREE	Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
GRADY	Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
CRABTREE	If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
GRADY	She's a transvestite.
CRABTREE	You're stoned.
GRADY	She's still a transvestite.
CRABTREE	Mm.
GRADY	Isn't she?

GRADY	It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
CRABTREE	Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
GRADY	I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
CRABTREE	I thought you were tinkering.
GRADY	I just mean...
CRABTREE	Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?

CRABTREE	You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
GRADY	It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
CRABTREE	He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire.

GRADY	He said something about being between things.
CRABTREE	Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.

CRABTREE	Trip??
GRADY	She left me. Crabs.
CRABTREE	Left you...? Who? Emily?
GRADY	This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
CRABTREE	But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?

CRABTREE	I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
GRADY	Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
CRABTREE	Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.

GRADY	Is that just beer?
CRABTREE	Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
GRADY	I'm sure. Where is everyone?
CRABTREE	Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.

CRABTREE	He has a book.
GRADY	I know. He started it Fall semester.
CRABTREE	He finished it Winter Break.

CRABTREE	So. Is he any good?
GRADY	No. Not yet he isn't.
CRABTREE	Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
GRADY	Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
CRABTREE	He is. Take my word for it.
GRADY	I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
CRABTREE	On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.

CRABTREE	No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
GRADY	Shut up and drink.

GRADY	He's a boxer. A flyweight.
CRABTREE	Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
GRADY	Not Curtis.
CRABTREE	Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
GRADY	And now he's addicted to painkillers.
CRABTREE	He can't piss standing up anymore.
GRADY	He lives with his mother.
CRABTREE	And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
GRADY	Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
CRABTREE	Because... because...

CRABTREE	That was good.
GRADY	He heard everything we were saying.

GRADY	Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
CRABTREE	Tripp.
GRADY	Yes.
CRABTREE	Hit your brakes.

GRADY	What's this guy's problem?
CRABTREE	Just go around him.

GRADY	Shit.
CRABTREE	Back up. Go out the other way.

GRADY	Wait here. I'll be right back.
CRABTREE	Where would we go?

CRABTREE	Tripp?!
GRADY	Shit.

GRADY	Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
CRABTREE	Tripp, where the hell...

GRADY	You stay there.
CRABTREE	What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?

CRABTREE	Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
GRADY	Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
CRABTREE	Sometimes we have to improvise.
GRADY	Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
CRABTREE	James? My James? What's happened?
GRADY	Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
CRABTREE	Kidnapped? By who?
GRADY	His parents.
CRABTREE	Good God. Let's go rescue him.
GRADY	Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
CRABTREE	Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
GRADY	It's a little late to call Admissions.
CRABTREE	Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
GRADY	Maybe... I don't know.

CRABTREE	You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
GRADY	Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
CRABTREE	I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
GRADY	Only in your bones?

GRADY	How bad is it for you?
CRABTREE	Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
GRADY	Which is?
CRABTREE	Competence.

CRABTREE	So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
GRADY	What's to tell?
CRABTREE	Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...

CRABTREE	Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
GRADY	I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.

GRADY	Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
CRABTREE	Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.

CRABTREE	So modest.
GRADY	So sensitive.
CRABTREE	Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
GRADY	It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
CRABTREE	The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out...

GRADY	Crabtree.
CRABTREE	Ye-es?

GRADY	Is he awake?
CRABTREE	I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
GRADY	Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.

GRADY	Shut up, James.
CRABTREE	So what's the problem?
GRADY	There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?

GRADY	Who do you think it is?
CRABTREE	The Chancellor's here? Now?
GRADY	Evidently.  Coming!

CRABTREE	I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
GRADY	Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.

CRABTREE	So -- what do we do now?
GRADY	Find the jacket.
CRABTREE	Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
GRADY	First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
CRABTREE	It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.

CRABTREE	Want some help with that?
GRADY	Don't touch it.

CRABTREE	Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
GRADY	Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
CRABTREE	So whose car is it?
GRADY	My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
CRABTREE	The hood jumper?
GRADY	He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
CRABTREE	Such as.
GRADY	'That's my car, motherfucker.'
CRABTREE	Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
GRADY	...we find the jacket.
CRABTREE	There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
GRADY	No wonder he screwed us over.

CRABTREE	Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
GRADY	Call it a hunch.

CRABTREE	Naturally you have copies.
GRADY	I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
CRABTREE	You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
GRADY	That was MacCaulay.
CRABTREE	Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
GRADY	He was never able to reproduce them.
CRABTREE	Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.

GRADY	Kind of a sign, you're saying.
CRABTREE	In a sense.
GRADY	I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.

CRABTREE	The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket.
GRADY	Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...

GRADY	Came to my senses.
CRABTREE	Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
GRADY	Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
CRABTREE	Do you know he won't expel him?
GRADY	No. But I don't think that matters.
CRABTREE	That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.

CRABTREE	Me? What can I do?
GRADY	Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.

GRADY	You peeked, didn't you?
CRABTREE	I peeked.

GRADY	How are you -- is it Joe?
GOATEE KID	Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
GRADY	Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
GOATEE KID	Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
GRADY	No...
GOATEE KID	I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
GRADY	It's cool, Jeff. Really.
GOATEE KID	I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.

GOATEE KID	I'll be... somewhere else.
GRADY	Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.

VERNON HARDAPPLE	You driving this car?
GRADY	Excuse me?
VERNON HARDAPPLE	This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
GRADY	It's mine.
VERNON HARDAPPLE	Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
GRADY	You must be mistaken.
VERNON HARDAPPLE	Bullshit.

GRADY	I passed out.
GREENHUT	You did.
GRADY	I've been doing that a lot lately.
GREENHUT	So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
GRADY	Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
GREENHUT	How long have you been having them?
GRADY	The last month maybe.
GREENHUT	How long have you been smoking marijuana?
GRADY	Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
GREENHUT	That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
GRADY	I've been trying to finish a book...
GREENHUT	And your wife left you.
GRADY	Is that in my chart?
GREENHUT	I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.

GRADY	I know.
GREENHUT	You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
GRADY	She told you about...
GREENHUT	Her dog, yes.
GRADY	Actually, it was her husband's dog...

GREENHUT	Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
GRADY	They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
GREENHUT	Better luck next time.
GRADY	So is my friend... is Sara still here?
GREENHUT	No. There's no one here.
GRADY	I have to see her. As soon as possible.

GRADY	Vernon.
VERNON	Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
GRADY	Who's got a gun?
VERNON	You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
GRADY	Relax, Vernon...

GRADY	Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
VERNON	Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.

GRADY	It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
VERNON	Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
GRADY	No, really...

VERNON	Who the hell is that?
GRADY	A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.

VERNON	Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
GRADY	'Fraid so.
VERNON	And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?

GRADY	Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
VERNON	Shoot.

GRADY	Boy or girl?
VERNON	As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?

GRADY	Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
VERNON	No sweat. Only do me a favor?
GRADY	Sure.
VERNON	Stop calling me Vernon.

GRADY	Hello?
SARA'S VOICE	Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
GRADY	Could you hold on a minute, honey?

GRADY	Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
SARA'S VOICE	Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
GRADY	I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
SARA'S VOICE	You're in Kinship?
GRADY	Yes. But that's not why I called...
SARA'S VOICE	With Emily?
GRADY	What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
SARA'S VOICE	Just what? Doing a little dusting?

GRADY	...reconcile with Emily.
SARA'S VOICE	Are you there to not reconcile with her?

SARA'S VOICE	Goodbye, Grady.
GRADY	No. Sara, you don't understand...
SARA'S VOICE	Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
GRADY	Yea?
SARA'S VOICE	How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.

JAMES LEER	It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
GRADY	It's very convincing.
JAMES LEER	It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.

JAMES LEER	It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
GRADY	...You carry firearms.

GRADY	Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
JAMES LEER	No! What gave you that idea?
GRADY	Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
JAMES LEER	She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
GRADY	Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.

JAMES LEER	You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
GRADY	You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
JAMES LEER	Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
GRADY	She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
JAMES LEER	So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
GRADY	Sounds like a good one.
JAMES LEER	It's not bad.

GRADY	Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
JAMES LEER	They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
GRADY	Well...
JAMES LEER	It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
GRADY	Really? That's remarkable.
JAMES LEER	I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.

GRADY	You cold, James?
JAMES LEER	A little.
GRADY	So what are you doing out here?
JAMES LEER	It's colder in there.
GRADY	You're right.

JAMES LEER	Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
GRADY	Heaven?
JAMES LEER	I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...

GRADY	James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
JAMES LEER	I'll miss my bus.
GRADY	This is worth it.

JAMES LEER	Is that really it?
GRADY	That's really it.
JAMES LEER	The one she wore on her wedding day?
GRADY	So I'm told.

GRADY	Go ahead.
JAMES LEER	Really?
GRADY	Really.

JAMES LEER	They're glass. The buttons.
GRADY	Like the lady herself.

JAMES LEER	It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
GRADY	I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
JAMES LEER	You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?

GRADY	Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
JAMES LEER	I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
GRADY	Right.

JAMES LEER	I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
GRADY	Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
JAMES LEER	You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
GRADY	Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.

GRADY	Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
JAMES LEER	I had to. Didn't I?
GRADY	Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
JAMES LEER	No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
GRADY	Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.

JAMES LEER	Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
GRADY	He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.

JAMES LEER	Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
GRADY	Yea, James.
JAMES LEER	What are we going to do with...

GRADY	I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
JAMES LEER	You?
GRADY	Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
JAMES LEER	Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
GRADY	I've got tenure.

JAMES LEER	That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
GRADY	That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
JAMES LEER	Whose tuba is that anyway?
GRADY	Miss Sloviak's.
JAMES LEER	Can I ask you something about her?
GRADY	She is. Ah. Here we go...

JAMES LEER	Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
GRADY	Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?

GRADY	Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
JAMES LEER	No thanks. I'm fine without them.
GRADY	Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.

JAMES LEER	This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
GRADY	Is he all right?

JAMES LEER	Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
GRADY	What's he saying?

GRADY	Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
JAMES LEER	Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!

JAMES LEER	Thank you.
GRADY	You're welcome.

GRADY	I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
JAMES LEER	I put you on the floor.
GRADY	Oh.
JAMES LEER	I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?

GRADY	Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
JAMES LEER	I guess there's probably a story behind that.
GRADY	There is, but it's not that interesting.

JAMES LEER	Want me to get that?
GRADY	Sure.

JAMES LEER	He didn't give his name.
GRADY	Who?
JAMES LEER	The guy on the phone.
GRADY	What'd he say?
JAMES LEER	He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
GRADY	What'd you tell him?
JAMES LEER	Yes.
GRADY	Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
JAMES LEER	I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?

GRADY	Afraid so.
JAMES LEER	That's a big book you're writing.
GRADY	I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
JAMES LEER	Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
GRADY	But... ?
JAMES LEER	Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
GRADY	Washed up?
JAMES LEER	Blocked.
GRADY	Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.

JAMES LEER	Professor Tripp?
GRADY	Hm.
JAMES LEER	How did I get here last night?
GRADY	No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
JAMES LEER	And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
GRADY	Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.

JAMES LEER	How's that?
GRADY	Well done, James.

JAMES LEER	I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
GRADY	I guess there's probably a story behind that.
JAMES LEER	There is, but it's not that interesting.
GRADY	So where have you been staying?
JAMES LEER	The bus station.

JAMES LEER	It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
GRADY	But James. I mean... How long?
JAMES LEER	A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
GRADY	Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
JAMES LEER	Who?
GRADY	I don't know...  Me.

JAMES LEER	Isn't this...?
GRADY	Hm.

JAMES LEER	I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
GRADY	Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?

JAMES LEER	She seemed to take it pretty well.
GRADY	Yeah, well, actually...

GRADY	Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
JAMES LEER	No.

JAMES LEER	I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
GRADY	Your aunt?

JAMES LEER	Humboldt County?
GRADY	Maybe...
JAMES LEER	It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
GRADY	Glaucoma?
JAMES LEER	Colon cancer.
GRADY	Jesus, James. Wow.

JAMES LEER	It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
GRADY	Where's that?
JAMES LEER	Carvel.
GRADY	Carvel? Where's Carvel?
JAMES LEER	Outside Scranton.
GRADY	I never heard of it.
JAMES LEER	It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
GRADY	Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
JAMES LEER	Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
GRADY	What kind of dancer?
JAMES LEER	Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
GRADY	James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
JAMES LEER	I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
GRADY	Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
JAMES LEER	When we fall, we fall hard.
GRADY	Amazing.

GRADY	I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
JAMES LEER	Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.

JAMES LEER	This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
GRADY	Kinship.
JAMES LEER	Kinship. And what's here?
GRADY	Unless I miss my bet... my wife.

JAMES LEER	The one that left you?
GRADY	That's right. That one.

JAMES LEER	Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
GRADY	How can you tell?
JAMES LEER	You can see the outline of a butt.

JAMES LEER	Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
GRADY	Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.

JAMES LEER	Maybe she didn't come here.
GRADY	She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.

GRADY	Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
JAMES LEER	It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
GRADY	Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.

JAMES LEER	It feels really... good... here.
GRADY	I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

JAMES LEER	I just wanted a little sip.
GRADY	I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
JAMES LEER	Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.

GRADY	Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
JAMES LEER	You're mad at me, aren't you?
GRADY	What?
JAMES LEER	You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
GRADY	It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?

GRADY	Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
JAMES LEER	Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
GRADY	Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.

JAMES LEER	So, why did you take me up there?
GRADY	I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?

JAMES LEER	It's warm.
GRADY	James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.

GRADY	That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
JAMES LEER	Because of my coat?
GRADY	Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
JAMES LEER	Jealous? Of me?
GRADY	Not you. Your talent.

JAMES LEER	You're lying.
GRADY	The hell I am.
JAMES LEER	Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
GRADY	I never said that.
JAMES LEER	Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
GRADY	I didn't mean it that way.
JAMES LEER	It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
GRADY	Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?

JAMES LEER	But, last night...
GRADY	Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
JAMES LEER	I'm sorry.
GRADY	And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.

GRADY	Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
JAMES LEER	Arsonist's Daughter meant something.

JAMES LEER	You coming?
GRADY	In a minute. Get us a table.

JAMES LEER	Want a bite?
GRADY	No thanks.
JAMES LEER	That's why you're having them. Your spells.
GRADY	Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
JAMES LEER	What would you call them then?
GRADY	I don't know... 'Episodes.'

JAMES LEER	It's because you don't eat.
GRADY	I eat.
JAMES LEER	When?
GRADY	When nobody's looking.

GRADY	You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
JAMES LEER	Okay.

JAMES LEER	Where you going?
GRADY	Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.

JAMES LEER	I'm not going with them.
GRADY	James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
JAMES LEER	I'm not going, with them.
GRADY	James, like it or not, they're your parents.
JAMES LEER	Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.

GRADY	I remember that. Five or six years ago.
JAMES LEER	Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
GRADY	Near Carvel?
JAMES LEER	I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.

GRADY	Get out of here.
JAMES LEER	That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
GRADY	In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.

JAMES LEER	Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
GRADY	Ah, wear whatever you want.

GRADY	And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
JAMES LEER	I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.

JAMES LEER	Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
GRADY	It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.

GRADY	Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
JAMES LEER	I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
GRADY	I'm a little worried, James.
JAMES LEER	Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
GRADY	Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.

JAMES LEER	Professor Tripp...?
GRADY	Yes, James.
JAMES LEER	Even if I end up going to jail....

GRADY	Yes, Hannah?
HANNAH GREEN	I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.

GRADY	Thanks for that. He all right?
HANNAH GREEN	I think so... What about you?
GRADY	Me? Sure. Why?
HANNAH GREEN	Just checking.

GRADY	He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
HANNAH GREEN	Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
GRADY	The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?

GRADY	James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
HANNAH GREEN	James'll know about George Sanders.

HANNAH GREEN	I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
GRADY	I thank you.
HANNAH GREEN	And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
GRADY	I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.

HANNAH GREEN	So what are you going to do?
GRADY	Do?
HANNAH GREEN	I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.

GRADY	Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
HANNAH GREEN	I would if I knew where I was taking him.
GRADY	Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
HANNAH GREEN	Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
GRADY	That strikes me as odd.
HANNAH GREEN	James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.

HANNAH GREEN	His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
GRADY	Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...

GRADY	All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
HANNAH GREEN	The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
GRADY	I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.

HANNAH GREEN	I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
GRADY	Oh. Well. I...

GRADY	Hey.
HANNAH GREEN	Grady!

HANNAH GREEN	I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
GRADY	No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
HANNAH GREEN	I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.

GRADY	Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
HANNAH GREEN	He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
GRADY	Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
HANNAH GREEN	At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
GRADY	Jesus.
HANNAH GREEN	Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
GRADY	Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
HANNAH GREEN	Who does?

GRADY	The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
HANNAH GREEN	I told you, Sewickly Heights.
GRADY	But where? I need the street.
HANNAH GREEN	I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.

GRADY	He cribbed that from Borges.
HANNAH GREEN	It beats 'What's your major?'

GRADY	Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
HANNAH GREEN	Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.

HANNAH GREEN	I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
GRADY	That good, huh?
HANNAH GREEN	No, it's not that, it's...

HANNAH GREEN	It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
GRADY	Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'

SARA	Professor Tripp.
GRADY	Chancellor.
SARA	I got the message you called.
GRADY	I got the message you called too.

GRADY	Easy there.
SARA	I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.

GRADY	I need to talk to you.
SARA	That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
GRADY	I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
SARA	Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --

GRADY	New?
SARA	Walter just got it back from the framer today.

SARA	You go first.
GRADY	All right. This morning --
SARA	I'm pregnant.

SARA	I'm sure.
GRADY	Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
SARA	I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.

GRADY	Emily left me this morning.
SARA	She's left before...
GRADY	She's left the room before. She always came back.

SARA	So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
GRADY	Simple.

SARA	Is that Cristaile?
GRADY	Hm.
SARA	My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
GRADY	If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
SARA	Has he asked to see the book yet?
GRADY	Yes.
SARA	And? Are you going to tell him?
GRADY	No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
SARA	Neither do I.

GRADY	Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
SARA	I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.

SARA	You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
GRADY	Is the thing -- is it over?
SARA	Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
GRADY	Nothing. I think I twisted my --

GRADY	Well...
SARA	Don't. I know what you're going to say.
GRADY	No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
SARA	You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
GRADY	I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
SARA	She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.

GRADY	Not have it.
SARA	No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
GRADY	Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
SARA	No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.

SARA	Who's gun is that?
GRADY	It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.

SARA	Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
GRADY	Caps.

SARA	Pow.
GRADY	You got me.
SARA	I love you, Grady.

SARA	I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
GRADY	Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?

SARA	Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
GRADY	I heard.
SARA	You heard? How?
GRADY	A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
SARA	Did you confess?

SARA	Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
GRADY	Really? That was fast.
SARA	I'm kidding. Hello?
GRADY	Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
SARA	Are you limping? Why are you limping?
GRADY	Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
SARA	Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
GRADY	No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
SARA	All right.

SARA	Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
GRADY	Really, Sara, I...

SARA	I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
GRADY	I know that. I know what's at stake here...
SARA	No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
GRADY	About the baby.
SARA	That... and you.

SARA	Who's that sitting in your car?
GRADY	James Leer.
SARA	What's he doing out there?
GRADY	I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.

GRADY	Sara.
SARA	I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...

GRADY	Oh?
SARA	It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
GRADY	I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --

SARA	I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
GRADY	Inside.
SARA	And the jacket?
GRADY	Over there. In the backseat of the...

GRADY	Someone stole my car.
SARA	Grady.
GRADY	Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
SARA	Are you sure you parked it there?
GRADY	Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.

SARA	This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
GRADY	Would Walter really press charges?
SARA	It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.

SARA	You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
GRADY	I think I might have.
SARA	And what do you think you might have said?
GRADY	I think I might've said I was in love with you.

GRADY	He told you.
SARA	He told me.
GRADY	And what did you say?
SARA	I said it didn't sound like you.

GRADY	I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
SARA	I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
GRADY	I'm through improvising.
SARA	Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
GRADY	I lost it all.
SARA	Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
GRADY	I know.
SARA	And you're old.

GRADY	Ouch. How many?
SARA	Dozens. It's very sad.

GRADY	I went and looked at some babies just now.
SARA	Oh?
GRADY	I guess you have to go on faith.
SARA	Some times...

GRADY	Did you tell Walter?
SARA	I told Walter.
GRADY	Does he still love you?
SARA	It didn't come up.

SARA	Did you just make that up?
GRADY	In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.

GRADY	You don't deserve me, you know.
SARA	I know, but sometimes...

GRADY	The more the merrier.
MISS SLOVIAK	Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.

GRADY	That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
MISS SLOVIAK	Why yes. How did you know?
GRADY	Lucky guess.

MISS SLOVIAK	That's a nice greenhouse.
GRADY	It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.

MISS SLOVIAK	Who's he barking at now?
GRADY	He's still barking at me. He's blind.

MISS SLOVIAK	I need a ride.
GRADY	I'm your man.

MISS SLOVIAK	Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
GRADY	James is... I don't know...
MISS SLOVIAK	Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
GRADY	I'm not sure that's possible.
MISS SLOVIAK	Sure it is.

GRADY	Listen, Antonia --
MISS SLOVIAK	Tony. Now that I'm home.
GRADY	Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
MISS SLOVIAK	Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?

GRADY	He's writing his name in water.
MISS SLOVIAK	What's that?
GRADY	Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
MISS SLOVIAK	That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
GRADY	He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.

MISS SLOVIAK	You mean because his career's ruined and all?
GRADY	Jesus. Is that what he told you?
MISS SLOVIAK	He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...

GRADY	That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
MISS SLOVIAK	It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.

GRADY	Walter?
WALTER'S VOICE	Yes?

WALTER'S VOICE	Who's this ?
GRADY	It's Grady, Walter.
WALTER'S VOICE	Grady?
GRADY	GRADY Tripp. English Department.
WALTER'S VOICE	I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
GRADY	I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
WALTER'S VOICE	It's three-thirty, Grady.
GRADY	This is important.
WALTER'S VOICE	Oh?
GRADY	I... I...
WALTER'S VOICE	What is it, Grady?
GRADY	I'm in love with your wife.
WALTER'S VOICE	Excuse me?
GRADY	Sara. I'm in love with her.

GRADY	No.
WALTER'S VOICE	Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.

TRAXLER	No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
GRADY	Oh... yeah.

TRAXLER	Is it good?
GRADY	I don't know. It might be...

TRAXLER	Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
GRADY	Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
TRAXLER	Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?

GRADY	Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
TRAXLER	Sick.

TRAXLER	Who's that guy?
GRADY	Her husband.

TRAXLER	What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
GRADY	Taking the long way home.

GRADY	Yo, Traxler.
TRAXLER	Hey, Professor Tripp.

GRADY	Do you get high, Sam?
TRAXLER	Only when I'm working.

TRAXLER	Holy shit. Are you serious?
GRADY	As a heart attack.
TRAXLER	Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...

GRADY	Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
HANK	Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.

GRADY	What made you pull out that old thing?
HANK	I was thinking of you.
GRADY	And?
HANK	It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
GRADY	Maybe I should read it.
HANK	Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.

GRADY	Where's Emily, Hank?
HANK	I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
GRADY	I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.

HANK	Where you stand?
GRADY	I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
HANK	She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
GRADY	Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
HANK	Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
GRADY	Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
HANK	Ah, right. The book.

GRADY	Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
HANK	Why did you come here, Grady?

GRADY	I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
HANK	Give me a break, Grady.

GRADY	Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
OFFICER PUPCIK	A jockey? You mean, like --
GRADY	Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.

OFFICER PUPCIK	Hardapple?
GRADY	I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
OFFICER PUPCIK	Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
GRADY	That's weird.
OFFICER PUPCIK	We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
GRADY	The perpetrator.
OFFICER PUPCIK	No, the dog.
GRADY	Just kidding.

OFFICER PUPCIK	One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
GRADY	I might have his number on campus.
OFFICER PUPCIK	That's all right. We'll find him.

HANNAH GREEN	Are you riding with me, James?
JAMES LEER	No, I'm going ho --

JAMES LEER	George Sanders?
HANNAH GREEN	Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
JAMES LEER	Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room.

JAMES LEER	There's so many...
HANNAH GREEN	Just a few then. The big ones.

JAMES LEER	Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
HANNAH GREEN	I haven't heard of half of those.

WALTER	I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
SARA	I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
WALTER	You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
SARA	I doubt it, darling.
WALTER	Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
SARA	You want to keep him happy.
WALTER	If he's happy...  I'm happy.

AUDREY	Of course, John.
GRANDFATHER	Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
AUDREY	The usual ten per cent?
GRANDFATHER	Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
AUDREY	How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
GRANDFATHER	... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...

BLONDE	Lay them down.
GRANDFATHER	Eh?
BLONDE	Lay them down.
GRANDFATHER	We'd be thrown out.
BLONDE	Your cards... lay them down... face up.

BLONDE	They're yours.
GRANDFATHER	They are?
BLONDE	The cards... you're bank.

BOY	Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
RINGO	Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
BOY	Oh don't be so stroppy!
RINGO	Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
BOY	Nine.
RINGO	Bet you're only eight and a half.
BOY	Eight and two thirds.
RINGO	Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
BOY	Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
RINGO	Shurrup!
BOY	I bet you're  -- sixteen!
RINGO	Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
BOY	Well --
RINGO	All right, take your hoop and bowl.

BOY	Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
RINGO	Y'what?
BOY	You heard, it gets on my wick.
RINGO	Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
BOY	I'm a deserter.
RINGO	Are you now?
BOY	Yeah, I've blown school out.
RINGO	Just you?
BOY	No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
RINGO	Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
BOY	Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
RINGO	Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
BOY	Yeah.
RINGO	Not much cop without 'em, is it?
BOY	Oh, it's all right.
RINGO	Yeah?
BOY	Yeah.
RINGO	What they like?

BOY	Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
RINGO	How about Ding Dong?
BOY	He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.

BOY	Why aren't you at work?
RINGO	I'm a deserter, too.
BOY	Oh.

GRANDFATHER	What about all these letters?
BOYS	Read 'em!

BOYS	Shurrup!
GRANDFATHER	Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.

GRANDFATHER	Can you fix him for me?
BOYS	Yeah.
GRANDFATHER	Sixpence.

GRANDFATHER	The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
BOYS	The police station.
GRANDFATHER	He'll be pulp by now.

NORM	All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
DIRECTOR	Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.

NORM	Sure.
DIRECTOR	And hurry, they're not looking too happy.

DIRECTOR	Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
NORM	I'll murder that Lennon.
DIRECTOR	But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...

DIRECTOR	You don't think...
NORM	They'll be here.
DIRECTOR	Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...

DIRECTOR	Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
NORM	Aren't you supposed to be in that box?

RINGO	Leave them drums alone.
FLOOR MANAGER	Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
RINGO	If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
FLOOR MANAGER	Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
RINGO	That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
FLOOR MANAGER	Spoil sport!
RINGO	Well!

FRANK	Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
JOHN	Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
FRANK	Sorry? 

JOHN	Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
FRANK	Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...

JOHN	Ever seen one of these before?
FRANK	Ah ... a shamus, eh?
JOHN	I see you go to the night court.
FRANK	I've made the scene.
JOHN	Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.

FRANK	We're nearly there, sir.
JOHN	Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.

RINGO	He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
GEORGE	You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
RINGO	Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.

GEORGE	Are you going in?
RINGO	No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
GEORGE	You never know, you might be lucky this time.
RINGO	No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.

RINGO	Me? Why?
GEORGE	Bag-snatcher.

RINGO	I don't snore.
GEORGE	You do - repeatedly.
RINGO	Do I snore?

GEORGE	Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
RINGO	No. I don't.

GEORGE	Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
SIMON	Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
GEORGE	I'm afraid I don't understand.
SIMON	Oh, my God, he's a natural.

SIMON	We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
GEORGE	Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
SIMON	Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
GEORGE	Of course I can.
SIMON	I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
GEORGE	I'll have a bash.
SIMON	Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
GEORGE	Ta.
SIMON	Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.

SIMON	Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
GEORGE	I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
SIMON	Grotty?
GEORGE	Yeah, grotesque.
SIMON	Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
GEORGE	But I won't.
SIMON	You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
GEORGE	I don't care.
SIMON	And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
GEORGE	And who's this Susan when she's at home?
SIMON	Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
GEORGE	Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
SIMON	I beg your pardon?
GEORGE	Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
SIMON	She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
GEORGE	She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
SIMON	Get him out of here!!
GEORGE	Have I said something amiss?
SIMON	Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!

GEORGE	That's not your Grandfather.
PAUL	It is, y'know.
GEORGE	But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
PAUL	Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.

PAUL	You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
GEORGE	A butcher?
PAUL	Yeah, she was fickle.

GEORGE	Gerron.
PAUL	No, straight up.

PAUL	Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
GEORGE	I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.

GEORGE	Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
PAUL	Now what's that supposed to mean?
GEORGE	I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?

PAUL	Did you look in here?
GEORGE	No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
PAUL	Well, let's broaden our outlook.

GEORGE	Sure. .
PAUL	Ah well. Eh, look!

PAUL	What's up?
GEORGE	He's sulking again.

PAUL	Ringo!
GEORGE	Wake up!

PAUL	Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
GEORGE	You crawler.

GEORGE	Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
PAUL	We do.
GEORGE	Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
PAUL	He hasn't.
GEORGE	Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
PAUL	The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.

SECRETARY	Oh, there you are!
GEORGE	Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
SECRETARY	You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
GEORGE	Is he?
SECRETARY	Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.

SECRETARY	Well ... come on.
GEORGE	Sorry.

GEORGE	Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
JOHN	If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?

JOHN	Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
GEORGE	Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.

JOHN	That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
GEORGE	He comes from a large family.

JOHN	Should I say it?
GEORGE	Follow your impulse.

GEORGE	I don't think that bit's right.
JOHN	What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?

JOHN	How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
GEORGE	You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.

JOHN	It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
GEORGE	I'll look in here again.

JOHN	What are we waiting for?
GEORGE	Come here.

SHAKE	Morning!  Who's that little old man?
GEORGE	It's Paul's grandfather.
SHAKE	Oh aye, but I thought ...

SHAKE	No, I didn't you did ...
GEORGE	Well, what happened?
SHAKE	The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'

SHAKE	Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
GEORGE	Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.

GEORGE	Sorry.
SHAKE	Eh, there's only three of them.

GIRL	Oh!
PAUL	Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
GIRL	Go away! You've spoilt it.
PAUL	Oh, sorry I spoke.

GIRL	Are you supposed to be here?
PAUL	I've got you worried, haven't I?
GIRL	I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
PAUL	D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
GIRL	You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
PAUL	How'd you guess?
GIRL	Oh, it's the way you talk.
PAUL	Is it ... is it, really?
GIRL	Are you pulling my leg?
PAUL	Something like that.
GIRL	I see.  Do you like the play?
PAUL	Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
GIRL	Gear?
PAUL	Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
GIRL	Thank you.
PAUL	Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?

PAUL	You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
GIRL	I'm not ...
PAUL	Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
GIRL	No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
PAUL	Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
GIRL	Yes.
PAUL	Aye, I knew you were.
GIRL	What's that mean?
PAUL	Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
GIRL	The big hammer?
PAUL	Oh aye, a sledge.
GIRL	But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
PAUL	No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.

GIRL	But that's not like a real person at all.
PAUL	Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
GIRL	They ought to be.
PAUL	Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
GIRL	What are you?
PAUL	I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
GIRL	I bet you don't sound like real people.
PAUL	We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
GIRL	Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
PAUL	What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.

PAUL	... all this and a jam butty too!!
GIRL	I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
PAUL	Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
GIRL	Why selfish?
PAUL	Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.

PAUL	No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
GIRL	Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
PAUL	Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
GIRL	Is she?
PAUL	Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
GIRL	And you honestly think that's what she meant?
PAUL	Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.

GIRL	Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
PAUL	And cunning.
GIRL	And what do you do about it?
PAUL	Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
GIRL	Pity.
PAUL	Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
GIRL	Yes.
PAUL	See you.
GIRL	Of course.

RINGO	Ah.
GRANDFATHER	Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!

GRANDFATHER	Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
RINGO	Well ... what's the matter with that?
GRANDFATHER	Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
RINGO	You can learn from books.
GRANDFATHER	Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
RINGO	Out where?
GRANDFATHER	Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
RINGO	Books are good!
GRANDFATHER	Parading's better!
RINGO	Parading?
GRANDFATHER	That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
RINGO	Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
GRANDFATHER	You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
RINGO	Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
GRANDFATHER	At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
RINGO	Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
GRANDFATHER	So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
RINGO	What's that mean?
GRANDFATHER	Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
RINGO	Oh ... I dunno.
GRANDFATHER	And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
RINGO	Yeah ... that's right.
GRANDFATHER	And what's it all come to in the end?
RINGO	Yeah ... what's in it for me?
GRANDFATHER	A book!
RINGO	Yeah ... a bloomin' book!

GRANDFATHER	When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
RINGO	Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
GRANDFATHER	You're only right.
RINGO	I'm not wrong.

GRANDFATHER	Where are you off to?
RINGO	I'm going parading before it's too late!

GRANDFATHER	Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
RINGO	Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
GRANDFATHER	Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
RINGO	What?
GRANDFATHER	Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
RINGO	Have they?
GRANDFATHER	That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
RINGO	Me!
GRANDFATHER	And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
RINGO	Oh, they seem all right to me.
GRANDFATHER	That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.

RINGO	What are you doing?
GRANDFATHER	Lip reading.
RINGO	What are they saying?
GRANDFATHER	Nothing good.

GRANDFATHER	Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
SERGEANT	Is there a fire, then?

GRANDFATHER	You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
SERGEANT	Eh?
GRANDFATHER	I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
SERGEANT	What's he on about?
GRANDFATHER	I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
SERGEANT	Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.

SERGEANT	Would you two like a cup of tea?
GRANDFATHER	You see, sly villains.

JOHN	Hello, Grandfather!
GRANDFATHER	Hello.
JOHN	He can talk then?

JOHN	And we're looking after him, are we?
GRANDFATHER	I'll look after meself.

JOHN	Come on let's get this coffee.
GRANDFATHER	Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!

GRANDFATHER	That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
JOHN	Every morning.

JOHN	That'll keep you busy.
GRANDFATHER	It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...

JOHN	Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
GRANDFATHER	Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 

JOHN	You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
GRANDFATHER	But I'm clean.

PAUL	Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
GRANDFATHER	It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
PAUL	Oh, well that's all right.  What?

GRANDFATHER	And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
PAUL	Don't dramatise.

PAUL	All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
GRANDFATHER	A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
PAUL	Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
GRANDFATHER	You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
PAUL	Yeah ... so what?
GRANDFATHER	Why do you always use your left hand?
PAUL	Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
GRANDFATHER	And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.

PAUL	With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
GRANDFATHER	Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
PAUL	Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
GRANDFATHER	Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.

PAUL	Anything to spare?
GRANDFATHER	We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.

PAUL	And another thing, where's that old mixer?
GRANDFATHER	Here, Pauly.

JOHN	No, that's his other one.
SHAKE	That's all right then.
JOHN	Clean though, isn't he?
SHAKE	Oh yes, he's clean all right.

JOHN	Is that yours?
SHAKE	For Ringo.

JOHN	Aye, he looks a right lurker.
SHAKE	You're undressed. Where are your clothes?

JOHN	Well, what are we waiting for?
SHAKE	Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.

JOHN	What are you doing there?
SHAKE	Hiding.
JOHN	I think you're soft or something.

JOHN	Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
PAUL	What little old man?
JOHN	That little old man.
PAUL	Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.

JOHN	How d'you reckon that one out?
PAUL	Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
JOHN	Well we know that but what's he doing here?
PAUL	Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.

JOHN	Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
PAUL	No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
JOHN	Oh, I see.

JOHN	Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
PAUL	Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.

PAUL	Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
JOHN	He's got you worried, then?
PAUL	Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.

JOHN	Gie's a kiss!
PAUL	Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.

JOHN	Give 'em a pull.
PAUL	Shall I?

JOHN	I hope he fell off.
PAUL	Don't be callous.

JOHN	We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
PAUL	Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...

JOHN	Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
PAUL	Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.

JOHN	Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
PAUL	Like what?
JOHN	Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.

PAUL	Let's go and muck in.
JOHN	Aye, before anyone stops us.

JOHN	You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
PAUL	Eh, don't take out me lines.

PAUL	Behave...
JOHN	Foreign devil ...

PAUL	What's he know?
JOHN	Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.

JOHN	She's going to show me her stamp collection.
PAUL	So's mine.

PAUL	We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
JOHN	Can't he? He's done it, son!

PAUL	Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
JOHN	Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
PAUL	What's old got to do with it?
JOHN	You needn't bother.
PAUL	Y'what?
JOHN	Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
PAUL	Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
JOHN	That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?

NORM	Are you listening to me, Lennon?
JOHN	You're a swine, isn't he George?

JOHN	If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
NORM	He started it.

NORM	Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
JOHN	Of course, he's concealed about me person.
NORM	No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.

NORM	Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
JOHN	Please, can I have one to surge with?
NORM	No.
JOHN	Ah, go on, you swine.
NORM	No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.

NORM	Paul, John, George - get at it.
JOHN	Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.

JOHN	Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
NORM	Well you're not going.

NORM	I'll brook no denial!
JOHN	It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
NORM	Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.

NORM	Now get on with it.
JOHN	We were going to do it.
NORM	Aye, well, now! 

NORM	Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
JOHN	Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.

NORM	Let's have you.
JOHN	Come on speedy!

JOHN	Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
NORM	Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.

JOHN	Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
NORM	Sit down, the lot of you.

NORM	Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
JOHN	You wouldn't!
NORM	I would though.

NORM	They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
JOHN	Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.

NORM	John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
JOHN	Oink! Oink!

JOHN	Hi Norm!
NORM	Hi, our lot!

JOHN	Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
NORM	Aye, let's try the dressing room.

NORM	The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
JOHN	Tonight? We can't make it ...
NORM	You've got a midnight matinee.
JOHN	Now, look here, Norm ...
NORM	No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
JOHN	What?
NORM	You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!

MILLIE	Hello.
JOHN	Hello.
MILLIE	Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
JOHN	No, not me.
MILLIE	Oh you are, I know you are.
JOHN	No, I'm not.
MILLIE	You are.
JOHN	I'm not, no.
MILLIE	Well, you look like him.
JOHN	Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
MILLIE	Oh you do, look.

JOHN	My eyes are lighter.
MILLIE	Oh yes.
JOHN	And my nose...
MILLIE	Well, yes your nose is. Very.
JOHN	Is it?
MILLIE	I would have said so.
JOHN	Aye, but you know him well.
MILLIE	No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
JOHN	That's what you tell me.
MILLIE	What have you heard?
JOHN	It's all over the place, everyone knows.
MILLIE	Is it? Is it really?
JOHN	Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
MILLIE	I knew I could rely on you.
JOHN	Thanks.

JOHN	You're a window rattler, son.
RINGO	Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?

RINGO	It'll only get you into trouble.
JOHN	Aah, shurrup, misery!

JOHN	He's betrayed the class.
RINGO	Oh, leave off!!!
JOHN	Temper! Temper!
RINGO	Well ...

RINGO	That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
JOHN	Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.

RINGO	Well!
JOHN	He'll get over it.

PAUL	Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
NORM	Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.

PAUL	And?
NORM	Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
PAUL	I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
NORM	Y'what?
PAUL	You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.

PAUL	Have <U>you</U> lost him?
NORM	Don't exaggerate.
PAUL	You've lost him.

PAUL	Eh, where's my grandfather?
NORM	Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
PAUL	Aye, I suppose so.

NORM	I've got the stuff. Come here.
PAUL	Aren't we ...
NORM	No, we're not!

PAUL	Where's my grandfather?
NORM	Don't start. Look.

RINGO	He belongs to Paul.
NORM	Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?

RINGO	None for me, then?
NORM	Sorry.

RINGO	That's mine.
NORM	Have done, and you lot get your pens out.

RINGO	Well ...
NORM	When I tell you to stay put, stay put.

RINGO	Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
NORM	Good lad, Ringo.

NORM	Stop picking on him.
RINGO	I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.

NORM	What do you think are you're up to?
RINGO	Someone put it on me.

NORM	Look after him.
RINGO	But...
NORM	Do I have to raise me voice?
RINGO	Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.

NORM	Yeah, you want to watch it.
SHAKE	It's not my fault.
NORM	Well, you stick to that story, son.
SHAKE	I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.

SHAKE	I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
NORM	Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 

NORM	He's been gone a long time.
SHAKE	Who?
NORM	Paul's grandfather.
SHAKE	Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
NORM	Down the ... er ...
SHAKE	Oh, down the ... er ...?
NORM	Yeah, down the ... er ...
SHAKE	Well, give a couple of minutes ...

SHAKE	Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
NORM	That's too easy for Lennon.

NORM	He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
SHAKE	You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
NORM	Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
SHAKE	But John hasn't got any.
NORM	What?
SHAKE	Nerves.
NORM	I know, that's the trouble.

SHAKE	I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
NORM	Clever.  George.

SHAKE	... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
NORM	Shurrup, cheerful.

RINGO	How's that?
PAUL	Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.

PAUL	Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
RINGO	Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?

PAUL	The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet. Blimey!
RINGO	And they want me?

RINGO	Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
PAUL	Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.

PAUL	What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
RINGO	You were twanging too loud.

PAUL	Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
RINGO	Get knotted!

SHAKE	Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
PAUL	You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
SHAKE	He can't be far.

SHAKE	Eh, what's all this?
PAUL	Oh, him... He's been lurking.

PAUL	Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
SHAKE	I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
PAUL	I'll set John on you!
SHAKE	Oh, anything you say, Paul.

SERGEANT	What is he?
POLICEMAN	I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
SERGEANT	Oh, a little savage, is he?
POLICEMAN	A proper Aborigine.

SERGEANT	So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
POLICEMAN	Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
SERGEANT	Well, he can't stop here.

1ST MAN	Hey, you on television?
ALVY	No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
1ST MAN	What's your name?
ALVY	You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
1ST MAN	You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?

1ST MAN	This guy's on television.
ALVY	I need a large polo mallet!

1ST MAN	Can I have your autograph?

1ST MAN	Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
2ND MAN	M'mm.

ACTOR	You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
ACTRESS	What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
ACTOR	You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
ACTRESS	Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.

ACTOR	It's an important issue.
ACTRESS	Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.

ACTRESS	You're like New York. You're an island.
ACTOR	Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.

ALVY	Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
ALLISON	Who are you?
ALVY	Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
ALLISON	Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
ALVY	What do you mean, next?
ALLISON	Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
ALVY	No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
ALLISON	Yes.
ALVY	So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
ALLISON	Why not?
ALVY	No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
ALLISON	It's okay.
ALVY	No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
ALLISON	Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
ALVY	I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-

ALLISON	Yes.
ALVY	that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
ALLISON	Do you feel all right?

ALLISON	Allison.
ALVY	Yeah? Allison what?
ALLISON	Portchnik.

ALVY	H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
ALLISON	Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.

ALVY	It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
ALLISON	Alvy.

ALLISON	We've been through this.
ALVY	If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
ALLISON	Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
ALVY	Well, why not?
ALLISON	Yeah, Earl Warren?
ALVY	Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
ALLISON	Lyndon Johnson?
ALVY	L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
ALLISON	Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
ALVY	Tsch.
ALLISON	The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?

ALVY	I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
ALLISON	You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
ALVY	Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?

ALVY	I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
ANNIE	Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?

ALVY	Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
ANNIE	You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
ALVY	Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
ANNIE	Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
ALVY	Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
ANNIE	I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!

ANNIE	Two minutes, Alvy.
ALVY	No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
ANNIE	In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
ALVY	You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
ANNIE	Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.

ANNIE	Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
ALVY	Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
ANNIE	Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
ALVY	I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
ANNIE	Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
ALVY	Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
ANNIE	H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.

ALVY	I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
ANNIE	Well, stop listening to him.

ANNIE	I missed my therapy. I overslept.
ALVY	How can you possibly oversleep?
ANNIE	The alarm clock.
ALVY	You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
ANNIE	I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
ALVY	Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?

ANNIE	Stop it, Alvy!
ALVY	Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.

ANNIE	Oh!
ALVY	I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
ANNIE	Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?

ALVY	Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
ANNIE	M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
ALVY	You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
ANNIE	That movie makes me feel guilty.
ALVY	Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.

ANNIE	Alvy, I...
ALVY	What-what-what-what's the matter?
ANNIE	I-you know, I don't wanna.
ALVY	What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
ANNIE	I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
ALVY	It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
ANNIE	I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
ALVY	M'm.
ANNIE	I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.

ANNIE	Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
ALVY	Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
ANNIE	Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.

ALVY	Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
ANNIE	Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
ALVY	If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
ANNIE	Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.

ALVY	Don't give it to me. Don't!
ANNIE	Oooh! Here! Here!
ALVY	Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
ANNIE	Get him!
ALVY	Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
ANNIE	I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
ALVY	Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?

ANNIE	Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
ALVY	Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
ANNIE	All right. All right. All right.

ALVY	Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
ANNIE	Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
ALVY	You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.

ANNIE	Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
ALVY	All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
ANNIE	It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
ALVY	All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!

ALVY	So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
ANNIE	Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
ALVY	Well, then, w-who was?
ANNIE	Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.

ANNIE	Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
ALVY	Hey, that was last year.

ANNIE	He was creepy.
ALVY	Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
ANNIE	Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
ALVY	La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
ANNIE	Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
ALVY	Well, no... not just, not only.
ANNIE	Oh, I'd say so. You married-

ANNIE	Hi. Hi, hi.
ALVY	Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
ANNIE	Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
ALVY	You-you play... very well.
ANNIE	Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.

ALVY	Uh... you-you wanna lift?
ANNIE	Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
ALVY	No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
ANNIE	Oh, no, I have a car.
ALVY	You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
ANNIE	I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
ALVY	Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?

ALVY	Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
ANNIE	Yeah, well, I'm, but I...

ALVY	So sorry.
ANNIE	I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
ALVY	Yeah.

ALVY	So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
ANNIE	Oh, I'm in her acting class.
ALVY	Oh - you're an actress.
ANNIE	Well, I do commercials, sort of...

ANNIE	Huh? Oh... yeah.
ALVY	You want your gear? Here you go.

ANNIE	Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
ALVY	Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
ANNIE	Oh.

ALVY	You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.

ANNIE	You sure?
ALVY	No, I got time.
ANNIE	Okay.
ALVY	Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.

ANNIE	Oh, you see an analyst?
ALVY	Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
ANNIE	Fifteen years?
ALVY	Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
ANNIE	Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?

ALVY	Sylvia Plath.
ANNIE	M'hm...
ALVY	Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
ANNIE	Oh, yeah.
ALVY	Oh, sorry.
ANNIE	Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
ALVY	Neat?
ANNIE	Neat, yeah.
ALVY	Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
ANNIE	Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
ALVY	Duane?
ANNIE	Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
ALVY	Well, who's Sadie?
ANNIE	Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
ALVY	Uh, narcolepsy.
ANNIE	Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.

ALVY	Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
ANNIE	Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
ALVY	...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...

ANNIE	Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
ALVY	No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
ANNIE	Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
ALVY	Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
ANNIE	Why not?
ALVY	'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
ANNIE	Oh, I see, I see.
ALVY	You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
ANNIE	Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
ALVY	'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
ANNIE	Fifteen years, huh?
ALVY	Fifteen years, yeah.
ANNIE	Yeah. Oh, God bless!

ALVY	God bless.
ANNIE	Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
ALVY	Oh, thank you.
ANNIE	Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
ALVY	So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
ANNIE	Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.

ANNIE	Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
ALVY	You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
ANNIE	Me? Oh, uh.  No.
ALVY	Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
ANNIE	Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
ALVY	Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
ANNIE	I know.
ALVY	Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?

ALVY	No, so help me.
ANNIE	it's my first time.
ALVY	That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.

ANNIE	I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
ALVY	Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
ANNIE	Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
ALVY	No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
ANNIE	No, I'm gonna quit!
ALVY	No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
ANNIE	Really, do you think so, really?
ALVY	Yeah!
ANNIE	Yeah?
ALVY	It's terrific.
ANNIE	Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.

ALVY	Hey, listen, listen.
ANNIE	What?
ALVY	Gimme a kiss.
ANNIE	Really?
ALVY	Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
ANNIE	Oh, all right.
ALVY	And we'll digest our food better.
ANNIE	Okay.
ALVY	Okay?
ANNIE	Yeah.

ANNIE	We can digest our-
ALVY	Okay. Yeah.

ALVY	I'm gonna have a corned beef.
ANNIE	Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
ALVY	Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
ANNIE	Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
ALVY	My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
ANNIE	Oh.

ANNIE	M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
ALVY	As Balzac said...
ANNIE	H'm?
ALVY	There goes another novel.  Jesus, you were great.
ANNIE	Oh, yeah?
ALVY	Yeah.
ANNIE	Yeah?
ALVY	Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
ANNIE	No.  You're a wreck.
ALVY	Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
ANNIE	You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
ALVY	Good? I was-
ANNIE	No.
ALVY	No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
ANNIE	Here, you want some?
ALVY	No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
ANNIE	Yeah?
ALVY	I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
ANNIE	Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
ALVY	M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
ANNIE	What? What?

ALVY	Hey?
ANNIE	H'm?
ALVY	I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
ANNIE	That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
ALVY	Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
ANNIE	Yeah?
ALVY	big subject with me, yeah.
ANNIE	Yeah?

ALVY	I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
ANNIE	M'hm.
ALVY	Those are the two categories...
ANNIE	M'hm.
ALVY	...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
ANNIE	M'hm.
ALVY	And blind people, crippled...
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
ANNIE	M'hm.
ALVY	You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
ANNIE	U-huh.

ALVY	Look, look at that guy.
ANNIE	M'hm.
ALVY	There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
ANNIE	M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.

ALVY	Look at these guys.
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
ANNIE	Oh! Italian, right?
ALVY	Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
ANNIE	Oh, yeah.
ALVY	No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
ANNIE	Oh, yeah?
ALVY	And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.

ANNIE	You see, like you and I...
ALVY	You are extremely sexy.
ANNIE	No, I'm not.
ALVY	Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
ANNIE	Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
ALVY	Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
ANNIE	Ooooh!

ALVY	You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
ANNIE	Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
ALVY	You- Do you love me?
ANNIE	Do I love you?
ALVY	That's the key question.
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	I know you've only known me a short while.
ANNIE	Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
ALVY	I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	Don't you think I do?
ANNIE	I dunno.

ALVY	Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
ANNIE	Of course.
ALVY	Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
ANNIE	Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
ALVY	Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
ANNIE	I have a tiny apartment.
ALVY	Yeah, I know it's small.
ANNIE	That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
ALVY	All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
ANNIE	You don't want me to live with you?
ALVY	How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
ANNIE	Mine.
ALVY	Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
ANNIE	I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
ALVY	No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?

ANNIE	How is it any different?
ALVY	It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.

ANNIE	That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
ALVY	That place is four hundred dollars a month?
ANNIE	Yes, it is.
ALVY	It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
ANNIE	You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
ALVY	Hey, don't be ridiculous.

ANNIE	Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
ALVY	'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.

ANNIE	Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
ALVY	Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
ANNIE	What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?

ALVY	No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
ANNIE	Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
ALVY	Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
ANNIE	Well, have you ever made love high?
ALVY	Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
ANNIE	It relaxes me.
ALVY	Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
ANNIE	Well, what's the difference, anyway?
ALVY	Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
ANNIE	Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
ALVY	Oh, come, you don't need that.

ANNIE	What are you doing?
ALVY	No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
ANNIE	Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
ALVY	M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
ANNIE	Uh-uh-why?
ALVY	I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
ANNIE	No, I'm fine.

ALVY	Really?
ANNIE	U-huh.
ALVY	I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
ANNIE	Let's just do it, all right?
ALVY	Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?

ANNIE	Oh, you have my body.
ALVY	Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
ANNIE	Well, I need grass and so do you.
ALVY	Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
ANNIE	M'hm.
ALVY	so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
ANNIE	Were you always funny?
ALVY	Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.

ANNIE	Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
ALVY	C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
ANNIE	Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
ALVY	Are yuh?
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.

ALVY	You're so sure about it.
ANNIE	Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.

ALVY	Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
ANNIE	No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
ALVY	Yeah.
ANNIE	It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.

ANNIE	You followed me. I can't believe it!
ALVY	I didn't follow you!
ANNIE	You followed me!
ALVY	Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
ANNIE	Well, what is your definition of following?
ALVY	Following is different. I was spying.
ANNIE	Do you realize how paranoid you are?
ALVY	Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
ANNIE	That is the worst kind of paranoia.
ALVY	Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
ANNIE	Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
ALVY	Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
ANNIE	Existential Motifs in Russian Literature! You're really close.
ALVY	What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
ANNIE	Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!

ALVY	Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
ANNIE	We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
ALVY	Neat! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
ANNIE	Who cares? Who cares?
ALVY	Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!

ANNIE	You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
ALVY	David? You call your teacher David?
ANNIE	It's his name.
ALVY	Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?

ANNIE	I'm home!
ALVY	Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
ANNIE	Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
ALVY	Yeah?
ANNIE	And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
ALVY	M'm.
ANNIE	And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
ALVY	Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
ANNIE	M'hm.
ALVY	G-go on, I'm interested.
ANNIE	Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
ALVY	M'hm.
ANNIE	And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
ALVY	Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
ANNIE	M'hm.
ALVY	That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
ANNIE	Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
ALVY	You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
ANNIE	In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
ALVY	Sinatra?
ANNIE	Yeah, and he's strangling me...
ALVY	Yeah?
ANNIE	and I keep, you know, it's-
ALVY	Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
ANNIE	She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
ALVY	Whatta you mean? Me?
ANNIE	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
ALVY	Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
ANNIE	Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
ALVY	Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
ANNIE	Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
ALVY	Will it change your wife?
ANNIE	Will it change my life?
ALVY	Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
ANNIE	No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
ALVY	You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
ANNIE	Life. I said, "life."

ALVY	She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
ANNIE	And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.

ALVY	Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
ANNIE	A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
ALVY	David! David! I can't believe this!
ANNIE	And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
ALVY	I'm following you and David, if you-
ANNIE	I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!

ALVY	What's- It's me, open up.
ANNIE	Oh.
ALVY	Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
ANNIE	There's a spider in the bathroom.
ALVY	What?
ANNIE	There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
ALVY	That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
ANNIE	My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
ALVY	Oooh.
ANNIE	I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
ALVY	Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
ANNIE	No.

ALVY	I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
ANNIE	I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
ALVY	Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
ANNIE	Yeah.
ALVY	Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
ANNIE	It was just great!
ALVY	Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-

ALVY	What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
ANNIE	Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
ALVY	It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
ANNIE	Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.

ALVY	Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
ANNIE	Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
ALVY	Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
ANNIE	I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
ALVY	Yeah, where is the spider?
ANNIE	It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
ALVY	Is he in the bathroom?
ANNIE	Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
ALVY	Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
ANNIE	Oh. What?
ALVY	Very big spider.
ANNIE	Yeah?
ALVY	Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.

ANNIE	Two?
ALVY	Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
ANNIE	Oh, I-I left it at your house.
ALVY	snow shovel or anything or something.
ANNIE	I think I left it there, I'm sorry.

ALVY	Okay, let me have this.
ANNIE	Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
ALVY	Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.

ALVY	Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
ANNIE	It's for my complexion.
ALVY	Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
ANNIE	Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
ALVY	Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
ANNIE	Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.

ALVY	Oh, Jesus, really?
ANNIE	Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
ALVY	What?

ANNIE	Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
ALVY	W-w-whatta you mean?
ANNIE	I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
ALVY	Oh, I had the radio on.
ANNIE	Yeah?
ALVY	I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
ANNIE	Yeah.

ANNIE	Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
ALVY	Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
ANNIE	Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
ALVY	It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
ANNIE	You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
ALVY	I don't know.
ANNIE	Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
ALVY	Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
ANNIE	Okay, okay. Okay.
ALVY	That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
ANNIE	Yeah.

ANNIE	-me, my God, it's a great day!
ALVY	Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --

ALVY	Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
ANNIE	Holy cow!

ANNIE	Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
ALVY	Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
ANNIE	Yeah, but it's real close.
ALVY	Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
ANNIE	Oh, darn it.

ALVY	Happy birthday.
ANNIE	What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
ALVY	Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
ANNIE	Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
ALVY	Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
ANNIE	Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.

ALVY	Here's a real present.
ANNIE	What... huh?
ALVY	Check it out.
ANNIE	Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
ALVY	Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
ANNIE	Oh! My God! 

ALVY	You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
ANNIE	Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?

ALVY	Remember, we had that thing.
ANNIE	What thing?
ALVY	Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
ANNIE	Thing?
ALVY	yes, we had, uh...
ANNIE	Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.

ALVY	What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
ANNIE	I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
ALVY	I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
ANNIE	All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?

ANNIE	That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
ALVY	Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
ANNIE	Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.

ALVY	Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
ANNIE	Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
ALVY	She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
ANNIE	And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
ALVY	I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
ANNIE	But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
ALVY	The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
ANNIE	I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
ALVY	You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
ANNIE	Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.

ANNIE	You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
ALVY	How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
ANNIE	That's sick!
ALVY	Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.

ANNIE	Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
ALVY	Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
ANNIE	Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?

ALVY	...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
ANNIE	No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.

ANNIE	God.
ALVY	Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...

ANNIE	God, it's so clean out here.
ALVY	It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.

ALVY	Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
ANNIE	Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.

ANNIE	Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
ALVY	I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?

ALVY	Christ!
ANNIE	Nothing at all?

ALVY	Yeah, this place is great.
ANNIE	Yeah.

ALVY	I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
ANNIE	Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.

ANNIE	Oh, good. Okay.
ALVY	I'm cool.

ANNIE	It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
ALVY	Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
ANNIE	Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
ALVY	Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...

ANNIE	Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
ALVY	Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.

ALVY	Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
ANNIE	Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
ALVY	Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
ANNIE	Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
ALVY	There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
ANNIE	Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
ALVY	This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
ANNIE	Oh-
ALVY	This is the first book that I got you.

ANNIE	God.
ALVY	Remember that day?
ANNIE	Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
ALVY	Thanks, honey.
ANNIE	Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.

ANNIE	Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
ALVY	Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
ANNIE	Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
ALVY	Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
ANNIE	What?
ALVY	We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
ANNIE	Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
ALVY	You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
ANNIE	Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
ALVY	Yeah.
ANNIE	I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.

ALVY	You look very pretty.
ANNIE	Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
ALVY	You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
ANNIE	Oh, Alvy, come on.
ALVY	Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
ANNIE	Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
ALVY	So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
ANNIE	What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
ALVY	Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
ANNIE	That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
ALVY	That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
ANNIE	Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
ALVY	I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
ANNIE	No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
ALVY	Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
ANNIE	You're mad, aren't you?
ALVY	No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
ANNIE	Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
ALVY	The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?

ALVY	You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
ANNIE	I'm late.
ALVY	Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?

ANNIE	If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
ALVY	The what?
ANNIE	The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
ALVY	You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
ANNIE	Oh!
ALVY	I thought just earplugs.

DUANE	Alvy.
ALVY	Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
DUANE	This is my room.
ALVY	Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
DUANE	Can I confess something?

DUANE	I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
ALVY	Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.

ALVY	What'd I do?
TEACHER	Step up here!
ALVY	What'd I do?
TEACHER	You should be ashamed of yourself.

ALVY	Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
TEACHER	Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
ALVY	I did.

TEACHER	Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
ALVY	Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.

ALVY	Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
ROBIN	Why are you so hostile?
ALVY	'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
ROBIN	Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."

ALVY	I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
ROBIN	Commentary.
ALVY	Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
ROBIN	No jokes-these are friends, okay?

ROBIN	Here you are. There's people out there.
ALVY	Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
ROBIN	Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
ALVY	What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.

ROBIN	Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
ALVY	Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere...
ROBIN	There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?

ROBIN	Oh, I'm sorry!
ALVY	Don't get upset!
ROBIN	Dammit! I was so close.

ALVY	Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
ROBIN	I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
ALVY	Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
ROBIN	Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?

ALVY	Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
ROBIN	I can't.
ALVY	What-
ROBIN	My head is throbbing.
ALVY	Oh, you got a headache!
ROBIN	I have a headache.
ALVY	Bad?
ROBIN	Oswald and ghosts.
ALVY	Jesus!

ROBIN	Where are you going?
ALVY	Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.

ALVY	Man, that's great. That's just great.
REPORTER	You catch Dylan?
ALVY	Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
REPORTER	You have a raccoon?
ALVY	Tsch, a few.
REPORTER	The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
ALVY	I can think of another word.
REPORTER	He's God! I mean, this man is God! He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
ALVY	Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
REPORTER	I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
ALVY	Are you?
REPORTER	Yeah.
ALVY	I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
REPORTER	It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
ALVY	Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.

REPORTER	I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
ALVY	Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
REPORTER	Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
ALVY	Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
REPORTER	I mean that as a compliment.
ALVY	I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
REPORTER	Who said that?
ALVY	Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.

MAN IN LINE	You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
ALVY	He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
MAN IN LINE	Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
ALVY	Key word here is "indulgent."
MAN IN LINE	without getting... well, let's put it this way...
ALVY	What are you depressed about?

MAN IN LINE	It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
ALVY	I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.

ALVY	Probably on their first date, right?
MAN IN LINE	It's a narrow view.
ALVY	Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy."  Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?

ALVY	I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
MAN IN LINE	It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
ALVY	What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
MAN IN LINE	...as opposed to a print...

MAN IN LINE	Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
ALVY	I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
MAN IN LINE	Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
ALVY	Oh, do yuh?
MAN IN LINE	Yes.
ALVY	Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.

MAN IN LINE	Oh.
ALVY	Tell him.

ALVY	Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
TONY	This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.

TONY	This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
ALVY	Trigger.

TONY	Charlie Chaplin.
ALVY	Hey.
TONY	Right before his un-American thing.

TONY	Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
ALVY	Yeah, I love it there.

GIRL DATE	What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
ALVY	I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
GIRL DATE	Oh, when'd you quit smoking?

ALVY	Sixteen years ago.
GIRL DATE	Whatta you mean?
ALVY	Mean?
GIRL DATE	You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?

ALVY	Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
OFFICER	May I see your license, please?
ALVY	Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...

OFFICER	Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
ALVY	Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
OFFICER	Just give me the license, please.
ALVY	Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.

ALVY	I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
ROB	You're crazy!
ALVY	No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
ROB	Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
ALVY	Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
ROB	Ah, Max, you, uh...
ALVY	Stop calling me Max.
ROB	Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
ALVY	No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
ROB	Right, Max. California, Max.
ALVY	Ah.
ROB	Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
ALVY	Forget it, Max.
ROB	We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
ALVY	No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
ROB	Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
ALVY	I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?

ROB	Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
ALVY	Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
ROB	Max, the city is terribly worried.
ALVY	But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
ROB	No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
ALVY	Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
ROB	Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
ALVY	Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...

ROB	Yeah, watch the road!
ALVY	You'll total the whole car.

ALVY	Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
ROB	We can show her the schoolyard.
ALVY	Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
ROB	Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
ALVY	Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.

ALVY	I have some very good memories there.
ROB	What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
ALVY	Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.

ALVY	Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
ROB	Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
ALVY	There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
ROB	While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.

ALVY	Oh.
ROB	Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.

ALVY	Do you realize how immoral this all is?
ROB	Max, I've got a hit series.
ALVY	Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.

ROB	Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
ALVY	Look, uh...

ROB	We do the show live in front of an audience.
ALVY	Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
ROB	Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.

ROB	What's the matter?
ALVY	I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
ROB	Well, sit down.
ALVY	Oh, Jesus.
ROB	You all right?
ALVY	I don't know, I mean, I-
ROB	You wanna lie down?
ALVY	No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
ROB	How about a ginger ale?
ALVY	Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.

ROB	You like this house, Max?
ALVY	M'hm.
ROB	I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
ALVY	Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
ROB	What difference does that make?

ALVY	I think he has a little thing for Annie.
ROB	Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
ALVY	Where?

ROB	The one with the V.P.L.
ALVY	V.P.L.?
ROB	Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
ALVY	Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
ROB	There are no twos, Max.
ALVY	Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
ROB	M'hm.
ALVY	And... uh-
ROB	How do you like this couple, Max?

ROB	And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
ALVY	Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.

ROB	If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
ALVY	I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.

ROB	Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
ALVY	No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
ROB	Hi. How do you do.

ALVY	Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
ROB	Yeah. Right.
ALVY	Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
ROB	We're gonna operate together.

ROB	Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
ALVY	Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.

ROB	Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
ALVY	You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
ROB	Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.

ALVY	Max, are we driving through plutonium?
ROB	Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.

ALVY'S FATHER	Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
ALVY'S MOTHER	His wife has diabetes!
ALVY'S FATHER	Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?

ALVY'S FATHER	You fired the cleaning woman?
ALVY'S MOTHER	She was stealing.
ALVY'S FATHER	But she's colored.
ALVY'S MOTHER	SO?
ALVY'S FATHER	So the colored have enough trouble.
ALVY'S MOTHER	She was going through my pocketbook!
ALVY'S FATHER	They're persecuted enough!
ALVY'S MOTHER	Who's persecuting? She stole!

ALVY'S FATHER	All right-so we can afford it.
ALVY'S MOTHER	How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
ALVY'S FATHER	She's a colored woman, from Harlem!

ALVY'S VOICE	Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
ANNIE'S VOICE	Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
ALVY'S VOICE	Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
ANNIE'S VOICE	Then there was Jerry, the actor.

ALVY'S VOICE	Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
ANNIE'S VOICE	I look pretty.
ALVY'S VOICE	Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...

ALVY'S VOICE	Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
ANNIE'S VOICE	Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.

ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER	That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
ALVY'S VOICE-OVER	Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER	I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
ALVY'S VOICE-OVER	I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER	If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
ALVY'S VOICE-OVER	If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.

MOM HALL	We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
ANNIE	We really had a good time.

MOM HALL	Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
ANNIE	Oh, yes, yes.

ANNIE	Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
MOM HALL	Oh, you remember her, Annie.
ANNIE	Yes, I do.

MOM HALL	Now, don't let it be so long, now.
ANNIE	No.

MOM HALL	Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
ANNIE	You think so? Do you really?
MOM HALL	We're going to take them to the airport.

MOM HALL	M'mmm.
ANNIE	I just have time to get the, uh-

ANNIE	Oh.
TONY	Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
ANNIE	Well, hi!
TONY	Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
ANNIE	Oh, yeah, really, oh!
TONY	I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
ANNIE	Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
TONY	Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
ANNIE	No, no, no, not at all.
TONY	Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.

ANNIE	Oh. What about?
TONY	...of possibly working together.
ANNIE	Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
TONY	No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.

TONY	Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
ANNIE	Yeah.
TONY	And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.

TONY	Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
ANNIE	Hey-
TONY	Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.

ANNIE	Oh.
TONY	It was a wonderful set.
ANNIE	Oh, gosh.
TONY	I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.

TONY	We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
ANNIE	I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
TONY	Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
ANNIE	Oh.
TONY	There's a whole wing in this house.
ANNIE	Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
TONY	You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
ANNIE	I don't know. I don't know.

ANNIE	Yeah.
TONY	Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
ANNIE	Yeah.

TONY	Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
ANNIE	Yeah.
TONY	It could be freezing, it could be raining.
ANNIE	Yeah.
TONY	And here, you just-

ROB	Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
TESSIE	I was a great beauty.
ROB	Uh, how did this personality come about?
TESSIE	I was very charming.
ROB	There were many men interested in you?
TESSIE	Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

BLONDE	I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
DOBISCH	My mother.
BLONDE	That's sweet.  That's real sweet.

BLONDE	This the place?
DOBISCH	Yeah.  How much?

BLONDE	You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
BLONDE	I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
DOBISCH	Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.

DOBISCH	Not there.  Under the mat.
BLONDE	Under the mat? 

BLONDE	So this is your mother's apartment?
DOBISCH	That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.

BUD	Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
MRS. DREYFUSS	Something the matter?
BUD	I seem to have dropped my key.  Oh -- here it is.

MRS. DREYFUSS	Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
BUD	Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

BUD	Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
MRS. DREYFUSS	Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
BUD	Ma'am?
MRS. DREYFUSS	From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
BUD	I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
MRS. DREYFUSS	Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

MRS. DREYFUSS	You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
BUD	Well, I have some paper towels --
MRS. DREYFUSS	Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
BUD	Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
MRS. DREYFUSS	So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?

MRS. DREYFUSS	You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
BUD	One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
MRS. DREYFUSS	What did I tell you?
BUD	Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
MRS. DREYFUSS	You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

MOFFETT	All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
BUD	Sheldrake?
MOFFETT	She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
BUD	Oh!

MOFFETT	What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
BUD	Care to make a small wager?
MOFFETT	I've been here twice as long as you have --
BUD	Shall we say -- a dollar?
MOFFETT	It's a bet.

FRAN	Morning, Mr. Baxter.
BUD	Morning, Miss Kubelik.

BUD	What did you do to your hair?
FRAN	It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
BUD	I sort of like it.

FRAN	Say, you got a lulu.
BUD	Yeah.  I better not get too close.
FRAN	Oh, I never catch colds.
BUD	Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
FRAN	That makes me feel just terrible.
BUD	Why?
FRAN	Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
BUD	That's me. 

FRAN	You should have stayed in bed this morning.
BUD	I should have stayed in bed last night.

FRAN	Twenty-seven.
BUD	You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
FRAN	You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
BUD	Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
FRAN	Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
BUD	Really?
FRAN	The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
BUD	I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --

FRAN	I hope everything goes all right.
BUD	I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
FRAN	Fine.  Wait.

FRAN	Good night.
BUD	Good night.

BUD	Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
BUD	I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
FRAN	How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
BUD	Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
FRAN	No.
BUD	Would you like to?
FRAN	Sure.
BUD	I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
FRAN	You mean tonight?
BUD	Yeah.
FRAN	I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
BUD	Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
FRAN	No. Like a man.

BUD	I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
FRAN	Just tell 'em -- now and then.
BUD	This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
FRAN	It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
BUD	Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
FRAN	I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
BUD	Oh, I understand.

BUD	Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
FRAN	What time does the show go on?
BUD	Eight-thirty.
FRAN	Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
BUD	All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
FRAN	Meet you in the lobby. Okay?

BUD	You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
FRAN	How is your cold?
BUD	What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
FRAN	So I see.
BUD	They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
FRAN	Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
BUD	Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
FRAN	How come?
BUD	A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
FRAN	Oh.
BUD	I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.

FRAN	Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
BUD	Eight-thirty!

BUD	Marry Christmas.
FRAN	Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
BUD	What gave you that idea?
FRAN	In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
BUD	Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
FRAN	I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
BUD	I forgive you.
FRAN	You shouldn't.
BUD	You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
FRAN	Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
BUD	Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
FRAN	Cheers.

BUD	One more?
FRAN	I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
BUD	You're so right.

BUD	By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
FRAN	Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
BUD	Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
FRAN	How many of those drinks did you have?
BUD	Three.
FRAN	I thought so.

BUD	You all right? What's the matter?
FRAN	Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
BUD	Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.

BUD	Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
FRAN	No -- I like it.
BUD	Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
FRAN	Of course not.
BUD	Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
FRAN	Much better.
BUD	Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
FRAN	This is a bad day for me.
BUD	I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
FRAN	I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
BUD	Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
FRAN	Why?
BUD	He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?

BUD	I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
FRAN	I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
BUD	No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
FRAN	I think so.
BUD	You don't think it's tilted a little too much --

FRAN	Here.
BUD	After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --

FRAN	What is it?
BUD	The mirror -- it's broken.
FRAN	I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.

FRAN	Your phone.
BUD	Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
FRAN	All right. Have a nice Christmas.

BUD	Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
FRAN	Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
BUD	That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
FRAN	I don't understand --
BUD	It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
FRAN	I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.

FRAN	I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
BUD	Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
FRAN	I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
BUD	Let me help you.

FRAN	I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
BUD	What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
FRAN	My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
BUD	Two o'clock.
FRAN	Where's my dress? I have to go home.

BUD	You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
FRAN	You don't want me here --
BUD	Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.

BUD	Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
FRAN	I just want to go brush my teeth --
BUD	Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.

BUD	Here. How about some breakfast?
FRAN	No -- I don't want anything.
BUD	I'll fix you some coffee.

BUD	Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
FRAN	My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
BUD	Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
FRAN	Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
BUD	You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
FRAN	I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
BUD	Who?
FRAN	Someone from the office.
BUD	And where are you now?
FRAN	In his apartment.
BUD	His apartment?
FRAN	I mean -- her apartment.
BUD	What's your friend's name?
FRAN	Baxter.
BUD	What's her first name?
FRAN	Miss. 

BUD	When are you coming home?
FRAN	As soon as I can walk.
BUD	Something wrong with your legs?
FRAN	No -- it's my stomach.
BUD	Your stomach?
FRAN	They had to pump it out.
BUD	Miss Kubelik, I don't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head. 

FRAN	But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
BUD	That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
FRAN	Thanks for reminding me.

BUD	I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
FRAN	He doesn't give a damn about me.
BUD	Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
FRAN	He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.

FRAN	She doesn't seem to like you very much.
BUD	Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
FRAN	Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
BUD	Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
FRAN	Open it.

BUD	There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
FRAN	That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
BUD	Sure.

BUD	You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
FRAN	I'm not very good at it.
BUD	I am. Let me get the cards.
FRAN	You don't have to entertain me.

FRAN	I think I'm going to give it all up.
BUD	Give what up?
FRAN	Why do people have to love people, anyway?
BUD	Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
FRAN	I don't want it.
BUD	Pick a card.

FRAN	What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
BUD	A bad insurance risk?
FRAN	That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
BUD	A cemetery?
FRAN	I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
BUD	Gin.

FRAN	I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
FRAN	Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
BUD	Cut.
FRAN	So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
BUD	Too slow?
FRAN	Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
BUD	You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
FRAN	Was he really upset when you told him?
BUD	Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
FRAN	Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
BUD	I'm sure that's the explanation.
FRAN	You really think so?
BUD	No doubt about it.
FRAN	Can I have that pad and the pencil?
BUD	What for?
FRAN	I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
BUD	You are?
FRAN	As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
BUD	Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.

FRAN	Why not?
BUD	Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
FRAN	I don't like myself very much anyway.
BUD	Pick up your cards and let's go.
FRAN	Do I have to?
BUD	You bet. I got a terrific hand.

BUD	You sure you want to throw that card?
FRAN	Sure.
BUD	Gin.

FRAN	Who was that?
BUD	Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
FRAN	Would you mind opening the window?

BUD	Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
FRAN	I just want some fresh air.
BUD	It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
FRAN	So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
BUD	Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
FRAN	Who'd care?
BUD	I would.
FRAN	Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
BUD	Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.

BUD	There's a call for you --
FRAN	For me?
BUD	-- Mr. Sheldrake.
FRAN	I don't want to talk to him.
BUD	I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?

BUD	Are you all right?
FRAN	Sure.  What's that funny smell?
BUD	Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
FRAN	Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
BUD	You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
FRAN	Are you supposed to?
BUD	In this house, you're supposed to.
FRAN	Oh.

BUD	What are you doing with that?
FRAN	I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
BUD	Thank you.
FRAN	It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
BUD	Well, things are a little disorganized around here.

BUD	Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
BUD	As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
FRAN	Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
BUD	It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
FRAN	You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
BUD	I guess so.
FRAN	I know so. He's a taker.
BUD	A what?
FRAN	Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
BUD	I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
FRAN	I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.

BUD	You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
FRAN	I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --

BUD	I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
FRAN	You did?
BUD	Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
FRAN	Over a girl?
BUD	Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
FRAN	No, I don't.
BUD	Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
FRAN	Where?
BUD	Here.
FRAN	In the knee?
BUD	Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
FRAN	That's terrible.
BUD	Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
FRAN	Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
BUD	Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 

FRAN	No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
BUD	So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
FRAN	Yes, nurse.

FRAN	Are we dressing for dinner?
BUD	No -- just come as you are.
FRAN	Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
BUD	You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 

FRAN	Shall I light the candles?
BUD	It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.

FRAN	I see you bought some napkins.
BUD	Might as well go all the way.

BUD	You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
FRAN	You usually eat alone?
BUD	Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
FRAN	Cheers.

BUD	You know what we're going to do after dinner?
FRAN	The dishes?
BUD	I mean, after that?
FRAN	What?
BUD	You don't have to if you don't want to --
FRAN	I don't?
BUD	We're going to finish that gin game.
FRAN	Oh.
BUD	So I want you to keep a clear head.

BUD	Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
FRAN	Fine. How's your eye?
BUD	Fine.

FRAN	How's everything at the apartment?
BUD	Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
FRAN	I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
BUD	You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
FRAN	I never thought he'd do it.
BUD	I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
FRAN	I guess so.
BUD	For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
FRAN	Yes.  You walking to the subway?
BUD	No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --

FRAN	Oh.
BUD	Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
FRAN	No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
BUD	That's very wise.
FRAN	Good night, Mr. Baxter.
BUD	Good night, Miss Kubelik.

FRAN	Are you all right?
BUD	I'm fine.
FRAN	Are you sure? How's your knee?
BUD	I'm fine all over.
FRAN	Mind if I come in?
BUD	Of course not.

FRAN	Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
FRAN	That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
BUD	In there.

BUD	What about Mr. Sheldrake?
FRAN	I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.

BUD	I love you, Miss Kubelik.
FRAN	Seven --  -- queen.

BUD	Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
FRAN	Shut up and deal!

MRS. LIEBERMAN	Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
BUD	Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
MRS. LIEBERMAN	Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
BUD	No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
MRS. LIEBERMAN	Good night, Mr. Baxter.

BUD	Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
MRS. LIEBERMAN	So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
BUD	Last night?
MRS. LIEBERMAN	All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
BUD	I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
MRS. LIEBERMAN	What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
BUD	Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
MRS. LIEBERMAN	I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.

MRS. LIEBERMAN	Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
BUD	What for?
MRS. LIEBERMAN	I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
BUD	Gas?

SHELDRAKE	Baxter?
BUD	Yes, sir.
SHELDRAKE	I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
BUD	Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

SHELDRAKE	Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
BUD	Mr. Dobisch said that?
SHELDRAKE	And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
BUD	Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
SHELDRAKE	Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
BUD	That's very flattering.

SHELDRAKE	Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
BUD	I don't know.
SHELDRAKE	Think.

BUD	Would you mind repeating the question?
SHELDRAKE	Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
BUD	You do?
SHELDRAKE	In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
BUD	The Vice Squad?
SHELDRAKE	That's right, Baxter.
BUD	What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
SHELDRAKE	What kind of joint are you running?
BUD	Sir?
SHELDRAKE	There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
BUD	Who?
SHELDRAKE	Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
BUD	Oh.
SHELDRAKE	Are you going to deny it?
BUD	No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
SHELDRAKE	You better.
BUD	Well, about six months ago -- I was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in Jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so I gave him the key    and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.

SHELDRAKE	Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
BUD	Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
SHELDRAKE	That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
BUD	Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --

SHELDRAKE	Where is your apartment?
BUD	West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
SHELDRAKE	How do you work it with the key?
BUD	Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --

SHELDRAKE	Where are you going, Baxter?
BUD	Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
SHELDRAKE	I'm not through with you yet.
BUD	Yes, sir.
SHELDRAKE	The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
BUD	Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
SHELDRAKE	How would you like to go tonight?
BUD	You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
SHELDRAKE	I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
BUD	Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
SHELDRAKE	Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
BUD	So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
SHELDRAKE	I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
BUD	Swap them? For what?

SHELDRAKE	It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
BUD	Oh?  Oh!

BUD	This?
SHELDRAKE	That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
BUD	I am?
SHELDRAKE	Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.

BUD	Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
SHELDRAKE	Relax, Baxter.
BUD	Thank you, sir.

SHELDRAKE	Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
BUD	Yes, of course.
SHELDRAKE	You know how people talk.
BUD	Oh, you don't have to worry --
SHELDRAKE	Not that I have anything to hide.
BUD	Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
SHELDRAKE	Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
BUD	You too, sir.

SHELDRAKE	Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
BUD	Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
SHELDRAKE	Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.

SHELDRAKE	I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
BUD	Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
BUD	Well -- I guess so.
SHELDRAKE	You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
BUD	Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
SHELDRAKE	No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
BUD	Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.

SHELDRAKE	To me?
BUD	I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
SHELDRAKE	Oh, yes. Thanks.
BUD	The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
SHELDRAKE	So it was.  She threw it at me.
BUD	Sir?
SHELDRAKE	You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
BUD	I know how it is.
SHELDRAKE	You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
BUD	No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
SHELDRAKE	Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
BUD	Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
SHELDRAKE	Put me down for Thursday again.
BUD	Roger. And I'll get that other key.

SHELDRAKE	Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
BUD	I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
SHELDRAKE	You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
BUD	I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
SHELDRAKE	What?

BUD	I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
SHELDRAKE	That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
BUD	Yes, sir -- I understand.  She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you?  Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --

BUD	Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
SHELDRAKE	Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
BUD	No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
SHELDRAKE	Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
BUD	For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
SHELDRAKE	Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --

BUD	Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
SHELDRAKE	And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
BUD	Sir?
SHELDRAKE	I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
BUD	You're going to take her off my hands?
SHELDRAKE	That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
BUD	You left your wife?
SHELDRAKE	Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
BUD	Yeah --
SHELDRAKE	Now what was your news, Baxter?
BUD	It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
SHELDRAKE	Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.

SHELDRAKE	You like?  It's all yours.
BUD	Mine?
SHELDRAKE	My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
BUD	Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
SHELDRAKE	Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
BUD	Yes, sir.

SHELDRAKE	That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom --  Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
BUD	I got kicked in the head, too.
SHELDRAKE	Oh?

BUD	Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
SHELDRAKE	You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
BUD	Yes, sir.
SHELDRAKE	I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
BUD	Naturally.
SHELDRAKE	Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
BUD	I see.
SHELDRAKE	The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
BUD	Don't mind what?
SHELDRAKE	You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
BUD	Very clever.
SHELDRAKE	Now I'll have to borrow your key.
BUD	Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
SHELDRAKE	What do you mean, sorry?
BUD	You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
SHELDRAKE	I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
BUD	Especially not Miss Kubelik.
SHELDRAKE	How's that again?
BUD	No key!
SHELDRAKE	Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
BUD	I dig.
SHELDRAKE	So what's it going to be?

SHELDRAKE	Now you're being bright?
BUD	Thank you, sir.

SHELDRAKE	Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
BUD	No I didn't.
SHELDRAKE	But this is the key to the executive washroom.
BUD	That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.

SHELDRAKE	What's gotten into you, Baxter?
BUD	Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
SHELDRAKE	Now hold on, Baxter --
BUD	Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

MATUSCHKA	Baxter?
BUD	Yes?

BUD	How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
MATUSCHKA	Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
BUD	Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
BUD	All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
MATUSCHKA	Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.

MATUSCHKA	What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
BUD	Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
MATUSCHKA	Fran been sick or something?

BUD	No, no -- just had a little accident.
MATUSCHKA	What does he mean, accident?

BUD	On account of me.
MATUSCHKA	You?
BUD	Who else?

BUD	Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
KIRKEBY	I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
BUD	I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
KIRKEBY	Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
BUD	Mr. Sheldrake?
KIRKEBY	That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
KIRKEBY	You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
BUD	I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
KIRKEBY	Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
BUD	Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
KIRKEBY	I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?

BUD	Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
KIRKEBY	Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
BUD	Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 

KIRKEBY	That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
BUD	Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
KIRKEBY	I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
BUD	Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
KIRKEBY	A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
BUD	Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
KIRKEBY	Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!

KIRKEBY	Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
BUD	Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
KIRKEBY	Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.

KIRKEBY	Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
BUD	Oh, I'm very grateful.

KIRKEBY	So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
BUD	So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.

KIRKEBY	Hi, Baxter.
BUD	What do you want?
KIRKEBY	What do I -- ?  Just a minute.

BUD	You can't come in.
KIRKEBY	What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?

BUD	Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
KIRKEBY	Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
BUD	Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?

KIRKEBY	Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
BUD	Now will you get out?

KIRKEBY	Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
BUD	No!

DOBISCH	Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
BUD	Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
DOBISCH	Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
BUD	Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
DOBISCH	That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
BUD	I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
DOBISCH	Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
BUD	I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
DOBISCH	Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
BUD	Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
DOBISCH	It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.

DOBISCH	Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
BUD	I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
DOBISCH	Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
BUD	Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

DOBISCH	Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
BUD	It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
DOBISCH	I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
BUD	Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
DOBISCH	It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
BUD	And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
DOBISCH	That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
BUD	Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

DOBISCH	Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
BUD	I have a vague idea.

DOBISCH	We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
BUD	Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.

BUD	I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
DOBISCH	You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
BUD	You threatening me?
DOBISCH	Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.

VANDERHOF	Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
BUD	Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
VANDERHOF	Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
BUD	I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
VANDERHOF	That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
BUD	Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
VANDERHOF	Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
BUD	Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
VANDERHOF	Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
BUD	Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.

VANDERHOF	Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
BUD	Yeah.

DR. DREYFUSS	Good evening, Baxter.
BUD	Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
DR. DREYFUSS	Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
BUD	Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS	Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
BUD	Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
DR. DREYFUSS	As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
BUD	I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
DR. DREYFUSS	Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
BUD	Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 

DR. DREYFUSS	You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
BUD	Me?
DR. DREYFUSS	When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
BUD	My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS	Slow down, kid.

BUD	There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
DR. DREYFUSS	Let me get my bag.

BUD	She going to be all right, Doc?
DR. DREYFUSS	How many pills were in that bottle?
BUD	It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?

BUD	What are you going to do, Doc?
DR. DREYFUSS	Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.

DR. DREYFUSS	Want to tell me what happened?
BUD	I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
DR. DREYFUSS	So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
BUD	Something like that.
DR. DREYFUSS	You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.

DR. DREYFUSS	What's her name?
BUD	Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
DR. DREYFUSS	Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?

BUD	Hello, Miss Kubelik.
DR. DREYFUSS	Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
BUD	Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --

DR. DREYFUSS	She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
BUD	Just as long as she's okay.
DR. DREYFUSS	These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.

DR. DREYFUSS	Any of that coffee left?
BUD	Sure.

DR. DREYFUSS	How do you spell her last name?
BUD	Kubelik -- with two k's.
DR. DREYFUSS	What's her address?  Where does she live?

BUD	Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
DR. DREYFUSS	It's regulations.
BUD	She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
DR. DREYFUSS	Aren't you?
BUD	It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
DR. DREYFUSS	Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?

BUD	Help yourself.
DR. DREYFUSS	I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
BUD	I'm not sure.
DR. DREYFUSS	A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
BUD	Yeah, wasn't I?
DR. DREYFUSS	But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.

DR. DREYFUSS	How's the patient?
BUD	Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS	Not you -- Miss Kubelik.

DR. DREYFUSS	Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
BUD	Sure, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS	How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
BUD	Well, I have things to do --
DR. DREYFUSS	What's this -- you packing?
BUD	Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.

DR. DREYFUSS	Where are you moving to?
BUD	I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
DR. DREYFUSS	Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
BUD	Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --

BUD	Can you use a bottle of champagne?
DR. DREYFUSS	Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
BUD	No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
DR. DREYFUSS	Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
BUD	You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS	Happy New Year.

MARGIE	You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
MARGIE	You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
BUD	What about him?
MARGIE	Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
BUD	That so.
MARGIE	All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
BUD	Who is Mickey?
MARGIE	My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
BUD	Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
MARGIE	Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
BUD	Well, you can't win 'em all.

MARGIE	'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
BUD	No.
MARGIE	Family?
BUD	No.
MARGIE	A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
BUD	I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.

MARGIE	Where do we go -- my place or yours?
BUD	Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.

MARGIE	Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
BUD	Not particularly.

MARGIE	Can I ask you a personal question?
BUD	No.
MARGIE	You got a girl-friend?
BUD	She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
MARGIE	Still stuck on her, huh.
BUD	Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
MARGIE	I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.

MARGIE	Say, this is Snugsville.
BUD	Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
MARGIE	No kidding.
BUD	Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
MARGIE	Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
BUD	Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
MARGIE	I'm with you, lover.

MARGIE	Not so rough, honey.
BUD	Good night.
MARGIE	Good night?
BUD	The party's over.
MARGIE	What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
BUD	It's an emergency -- see you some other time.

MARGIE	Say, what's going on here, anyway?
BUD	Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
MARGIE	My shoes.

BUD	Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
MARGIE	You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!

KIRKEBY	-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
DOBISCH	Who?
KIRKEBY	Kubelik.
DOBISCH	No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
KIRKEBY	Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
DOBISCH	A.W.O.L.?
KIRKEBY	What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.

DOBISCH	I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
KIRKEBY	Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
DOBISCH	Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?

KIRKEBY	Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
DOBISCH	Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?

KIRKEBY	That guy really must've belted him.
DOBISCH	Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.

FRAN	Sleeping pills.
DR. DREYFUSS	That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
FRAN	Doctor.
DR. DREYFUSS	Dr. Dreyfuss.
FRAN	Dreyfuss.
DR. DREYFUSS	Get more coffee.

DR. DREYFUSS	Tell me again -- what's my name?
FRAN	Dr. Dreyfuss.
DR. DREYFUSS	And what happened to you?
FRAN	I took sleeping pills.
DR. DREYFUSS	Do you know where you are, Fran?
FRAN	No.
DR. DREYFUSS	Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
FRAN	I don't know.

DR. DREYFUSS	Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
FRAN	Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.

FRAN	Please -- just let me sleep.
DR. DREYFUSS	You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.

MATUSCHKA	What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
FRAN	This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.

MATUSCHKA	What for?
FRAN	Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
MATUSCHKA	Why did you take sleeping pills?

FRAN	You fool -- you damn fool.
MATUSCHKA	Come on, Fran.
FRAN	Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

MISS OLSEN	Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
FRAN	I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
FRAN	Yes, I know.
MISS OLSEN	So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
FRAN	I don't know what you're talking about.
MISS OLSEN	And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
FRAN	Will you excuse me?
MISS OLSEN	What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.

FRAN	Well -- thank you.
MISS OLSEN	Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.

FRAN	Still afraid somebody may see us together?
SHELDRAKE	Let me take that.
FRAN	No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
SHELDRAKE	It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
FRAN	That's right.
SHELDRAKE	You know I liked it better long.
FRAN	Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

SHELDRAKE	How long has it been -- a month?
FRAN	Six weeks. But who's counting?
SHELDRAKE	I missed you, Fran.
FRAN	Like old times. Same booth, same song --
SHELDRAKE	It's been hell.
FRAN	-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
SHELDRAKE	You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
FRAN	Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
SHELDRAKE	I don't believe you.
FRAN	Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
SHELDRAKE	I never said goodbye, Fran.
FRAN	For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --

SHELDRAKE	How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
FRAN	Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
SHELDRAKE	I want you back, Fran.
FRAN	Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
SHELDRAKE	You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
SHELDRAKE	Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
FRAN	No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
SHELDRAKE	Important?
FRAN	Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.

SHELDRAKE	Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
FRAN	Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
SHELDRAKE	Remember what we talked about?
FRAN	We talked about a lot of things.
SHELDRAKE	I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
FRAN	We didn't talk about it -- you did.
SHELDRAKE	You didn't really believe me, did you?
FRAN	They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
SHELDRAKE	That's enough, Fran.
FRAN	Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
SHELDRAKE	You're not being funny.
FRAN	I wasn't trying.
SHELDRAKE	If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
FRAN	Okay. I'm sorry.
SHELDRAKE	I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
FRAN	Handle what?
SHELDRAKE	What do you think?
FRAN	Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
SHELDRAKE	Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
FRAN	Are you sure that's what you want?
SHELDRAKE	I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
FRAN	You know I do.
SHELDRAKE	Fran --

FRAN	I have that date -- remember?
SHELDRAKE	I love you -- remember?

FRAN	Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
SHELDRAKE	I promise.

SHELDRAKE	Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
FRAN	Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
SHELDRAKE	Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
FRAN	Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
SHELDRAKE	Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
FRAN	I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
SHELDRAKE	Now, Fran --
FRAN	And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
SHELDRAKE	Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.

FRAN	How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
SHELDRAKE	It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
FRAN	Merry Christmas.

SHELDRAKE	Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
FRAN	Yeah, we better.
SHELDRAKE	I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.

FRAN	Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
SHELDRAKE	Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
FRAN	A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
SHELDRAKE	Stop that, Fran.
FRAN	You'll miss your train, Jeff.

SHELDRAKE	Coming?
FRAN	You run along -- I want to fix my face.
SHELDRAKE	Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
FRAN	Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
SHELDRAKE	It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.

FRAN	Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
SHELDRAKE	Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --

SHELDRAKE	Are you there, Fran?
FRAN	Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
SHELDRAKE	There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran. 

SHELDRAKE	Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
FRAN	All set for what?
SHELDRAKE	I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
FRAN	Atlantic City?
SHELDRAKE	I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
FRAN	Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
SHELDRAKE	I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
FRAN	Baxter?
SHELDRAKE	He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
FRAN	He wouldn't.
SHELDRAKE	Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
FRAN	The nerve.
SHELDRAKE	That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
FRAN	I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
SHELDRAKE	What are you talking about?
FRAN	I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.

KIRKEBY	Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
SYLVIA	First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
KIRKEBY	Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
SYLVIA	What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
KIRKEBY	What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.

SYLVIA	Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
KIRKEBY	Sssssh.

SYLVIA	You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
KIRKEBY	Don't you ever stop talking?

KIRKEBY	Where do you live?
SYLVIA	I told you -- with my mother.
KIRKEBY	Where does she live?
SYLVIA	A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
KIRKEBY	All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
SYLVIA	Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
KIRKEBY	Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
SYLVIA	You mean you bring other girls up here?
KIRKEBY	Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.

SYLVIA	Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
KIRKEBY	Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
SYLVIA	Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
KIRKEBY	Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.

KIRKEBY	Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
SYLVIA	What gives?
KIRKEBY	A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
SYLVIA	Go where?
KIRKEBY	What's your mother doing this afternoon?
SYLVIA	She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
KIRKEBY	Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
SYLVIA	That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --

MISS OLSEN	Did you have a nice Christmas?
SHELDRAKE	Lovely. You were a big help.
MISS OLSEN	Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
MISS OLSEN	I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
SHELDRAKE	But I thought you could hold your tongue.
MISS OLSEN	It won't happen again.
SHELDRAKE	You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
MISS OLSEN	You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
SHELDRAKE	I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
MISS OLSEN	Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

TOMMY	Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
SHELDRAKE	It's a thought.
TOMMY	Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
SHELDRAKE	See if they'll what?
TOMMY	Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
SHELDRAKE	Oh -- oh!

BEVERLY	I didn't know you had a secret admire.
CAROL	Huh?
BEVERLY	You met the gift.

CAROL	There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
BEVERLY	Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
CAROL	It lets a crazy man into our lives.
BEVERLY	Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.

BEVERLY	You're not still writing that thank-you note?
CAROL	I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
BEVERLY	C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
CAROL	I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
BEVERLY	Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
CAROL	I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.

CAROL	I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
BEVERLY	Go ahead.
CAROL	... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
BEVERLY	Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
CAROL	Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.

CAROL	What is it you want? What?
BEVERLY	I want us to go out.

BEVERLY	How was it talking to him?
CAROL	Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
BEVERLY	Well, maybe he has nice friends.

BEVERLY	Call me as soon as you're settled.
CAROL	I love you.

CAROL	Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
BEVERLY	Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.

SPENCER	I'm sorry.
CAROL	Don't be silly. How bad?
SPENCER	Not bad.

SPENCER	Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
CAROL	No, I didn't.  So why are you h...

SPENCER	He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
CAROL	Stay out of this...  Doctor?

CAROL	Do you love me?
SPENCER	Uh-huh.

CAROL	What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
DR. BETTES	Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
CAROL	Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
DR. BETTES	He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
CAROL	Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.

DR. BETTES	My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
CAROL	I'm a waitress.

DR. BETTES	How long has he been having problems?
CAROL	Since forever.
DR. BETTES	Have they done blood tests on him?
CAROL	Yes.
DR. BETTES	Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
CAROL	Emergency room only.
DR. BETTES	Have they done skin testing for allergies?
CAROL	No.
DR. BETTES	They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
CAROL	No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
DR. BETTES	It's amazing these things weren't done.
CAROL	Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
DR. BETTES	No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
CAROL	Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
DR. BETTES	Me. My home number is on this card.
CAROL	His home number.

CAROL	Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
DR. BETTES	Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
CAROL	No.

CAROL	Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
DR. BETTES	They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

MELVIN	I'm starving.
CAROL	Will you please take it?

CAROL	I know. He's just the best.
MELVIN	I've got Jews at my table.
CAROL	It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.

MELVIN	The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
CAROL	You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
MELVIN	We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.

MELVIN	Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
CAROL	Okay.

CAROL	What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
MELVIN	I see the help -- judgement call.
CAROL	Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
MELVIN	What's wrong with your son, anyway?
CAROL	What do you care?

CAROL	He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
MELVIN	No.
CAROL	An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
MELVIN	His name?
CAROL	Spencer.
MELVIN	Okay.
CAROL	Spence.

CAROL	So what are you doing with a dog?
MELVIN	Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
CAROL	You're not worried that someone might take him?
MELVIN	Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
CAROL	Sorry.
MELVIN	It's okay -- I'll sit here.

CAROL	You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
MELVIN	How old are you?
CAROL	Oh, please...
MELVIN	If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.

CAROL	And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
MELVIN	Otherwise, you're not ugly.
CAROL	Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
MELVIN	What's with the dark?

MELVIN	Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
CAROL	You all set here?

MELVIN	I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
CAROL	What are you doing here?

MELVIN	This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
CAROL	Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
MELVIN	I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
CAROL	What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
MELVIN	Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
CAROL	My son is sick, okay?

MELVIN	What about your mother?
CAROL	How do you know about my mother?
MELVIN	I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!

CAROL	Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
MELVIN	How ya doing?

MELVIN	Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
CAROL	No!!! Stay away from me!

CAROL	Uh, Udall?
MELVIN	Carol the waitress?
CAROL	Yes.

CAROL	The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
MELVIN	I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
CAROL	That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
MELVIN	Note. Put it in the note.
CAROL	Why did yo do this for me?
MELVIN	To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
CAROL	But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...

MELVIN	You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
CAROL	I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
MELVIN	What needs clearing up?
CAROL	I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.

CAROL	I'm not kidding.
MELVIN	Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
CAROL	Just how grateful I am.

MELVIN	So you'll be at work?
CAROL	Yes.

MELVIN	What's this?
CAROL	A thank-you note for what you did for me.

CAROL	Getting loud, getting loud.
MELVIN	He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
CAROL	I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.

CAROL	So. Anything else?
MELVIN	Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
CAROL	Okay.
MELVIN	Hey, what I did for you is working out?
CAROL	What you did changed my life.

MELVIN	No... no thank you notes.
CAROL	Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
MELVIN	Lovely.
CAROL	I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...

MELVIN	Nice of you... thank you.
CAROL	Thank you.
MELVIN	Now I want you to do something for me.

CAROL	Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
MELVIN	I want you to go on this trip.
CAROL	No, sir...
MELVIN	I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
CAROL	The stiff one eye?
MELVIN	Two days.
CAROL	I can't. I work.
MELVIN	You take off when you have to.
CAROL	My son.
MELVIN	Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
CAROL	Melvin, I'd rather not.
MELVIN	What's that got to do with it?
CAROL	Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
MELVIN	Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
CAROL	Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
MELVIN	Is there another way to see it?
CAROL	No.

CAROL	Hello?
MELVIN	Are you still coming?
CAROL	Yes.

CAROL	Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
MELVIN	Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
CAROL	There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
MELVIN	Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
CAROL	Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
MELVIN	Whether crabs are in season there now...
CAROL	Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.

CAROL	Hi.
MELVIN	Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
CAROL	Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?

MELVIN	I was going to do that for you.
CAROL	It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
MELVIN	I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
CAROL	Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.

CAROL	Thanks, Melvin.
MELVIN	Welcome.

CAROL	I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
MELVIN	Nonsense!
CAROL	Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.

CAROL	Hey -- you let him...
MELVIN	You like sad stories -- you want mine.

MELVIN	... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
CAROL	Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.

MELVIN	That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
CAROL	No.

CAROL	No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
MELVIN	Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.

CAROL	My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
MELVIN	Dancing?

CAROL	Stop asking everyone.
MELVIN	Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.

MELVIN	No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
CAROL	You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?

CAROL	You wanna dance?
MELVIN	I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
CAROL	And?
MELVIN	No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.

MELVIN	No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
CAROL	Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
MELVIN	That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
CAROL	That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
MELVIN	Okay.

CAROL	And mean it...
MELVIN	Can we order first?

MELVIN	Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
CAROL	Fries.
MELVIN	One baked -- one fries.

CAROL	I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
MELVIN	Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
CAROL	I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.

CAROL	That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
MELVIN	Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.

CAROL	So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
MELVIN	Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.

CAROL	Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
MELVIN	Never.
CAROL	Here's the trouble with never.

MELVIN	You don't owe me that.
CAROL	That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?

MELVIN	Well, ah... that's a personal question.
CAROL	Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.

CAROL	If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
MELVIN	There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
CAROL	Sex with Simon?
MELVIN	It's one idea...
CAROL	That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
MELVIN	I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
CAROL	I'll never forget you said it.
MELVIN	It was a mistake.

MELVIN	Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
CAROL	To hell with sex.

MELVIN	Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
CAROL	Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
MELVIN	Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.

CAROL	I don't want to hear that music right now.
MELVIN	What do you mean? You said you liked it.
CAROL	I don't.
MELVIN	This one has a special meaning.
CAROL	It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.

MELVIN	Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
CAROL	I'll take a bus.
MELVIN	I'll take you... why not?
CAROL	I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.

MELVIN	Hello.
CAROL	Yeah... Well...
MELVIN	How you doing?
CAROL	I can trust my brain.
MELVIN	That seems like a good choice.
CAROL	I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
MELVIN	The two might go together.
CAROL	See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
MELVIN	Cute.
CAROL	You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?

MELVIN	Okay to say something now?
CAROL	Go ahead.
MELVIN	I should've danced with you.
CAROL	Okay. Good-bye.
MELVIN	So long.

CAROL	What do you want, Melvin?
MELVIN	Were you asleep?
CAROL	What do you want?
MELVIN	'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
CAROL	Grouchy?
MELVIN	... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
CAROL	What job?
MELVIN	Were you asleep?
CAROL	What are you doing here?

CAROL	I wasn't asleep!!
MELVIN	What a break...
CAROL	Is it a secret what you're doing here?
MELVIN	I had to see you...
CAROL	Because...
MELVIN	It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.

MELVIN	Boyfriend?
CAROL	Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
MELVIN	Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.

MELVIN	It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
CAROL	See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
MELVIN	If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
CAROL	Okay.

MELVIN	I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
CAROL	Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.

MELVIN	Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
CAROL	You know what? I...
MELVIN	Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...

CAROL	No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
MELVIN	I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.

CAROL	I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
SIMON	I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.

SIMON	Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
CAROL	Yes. I really would.
SIMON	Well...
CAROL	No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.

CAROL	I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
SIMON	No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
CAROL	What a nice compliment.

SIMON	Was this supposed to be your room?
CAROL	Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.

SIMON	Can you not be violent?
CAROL	I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
SIMON	No!!!
CAROL	I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
SIMON	Uh-huh...
CAROL	I'm sorry... are you okay?
SIMON	Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
CAROL	Why? What have you been thinking about?
SIMON	How to die, mostly.
CAROL	Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.

SIMON	Good night.
CAROL	Good night.

SIMON	I've got to sketch you.
CAROL	No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
SIMON	I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
CAROL	Stop staring. Do a vase.
SIMON	But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
CAROL	Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
SIMON	That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
CAROL	All right, cut me a break.

CAROL	We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
SIMON	I just love her.  How're you doing?

CAROL	But what about...
SIMON	I'll take care of myself --

CAROL	One night with me!
SIMON	You think you're kidding.

SIMON	I love you...  Let him take you home.
CAROL	Don't want to. I love you.

CHERYL	What the heck are those for?
MELVIN	No. No. Get Carol.
CHERYL	I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
MELVIN	What are you trying to do to me?
CHERYL	What the heck do you mean?
MELVIN	Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!

MELVIN	Help!
DOCTOR	If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
MELVIN	Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
DOCTOR	There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.

MELVIN	You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
DOCTOR	I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
MELVIN	You changed the room around...
DOCTOR	Two years ago...

DOCTOR	I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
MELVIN	Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
DOCTOR	Yes.  No.

SIMON	He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
FRANK	Won't worry about it. You go ahead.

FRANK	Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
SIMON	Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?

SIMON	So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
FRANK	Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
SIMON	How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
FRANK	No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
SIMON	You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
FRANK	Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

FRANK	I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
SIMON	So am I, Frank.

FRANK	Simon, you've got to get dressed.
MELVIN	What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?

FRANK	Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
MELVIN	Hope you find him. I love that dog.

MELVIN	No touch. No touch. No touch.
FRANK	You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
MELVIN	Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
FRANK	Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!

FRANK	You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
MELVIN	I'm not saying nothing to you.
FRANK	Thanks for looking after him.

MELVIN	Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
FRANK	You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.

FRANK	How's Verdell doing?
MELVIN	He's a pain in the ass.

FRANK	Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
MELVIN	It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
FRANK	No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
MELVIN	Okay by me.

MELVIN	It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
FRANK	Sure -- take him to the vet.
MELVIN	I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
FRANK	Do it.

FRANK	She's nice.
MELVIN	Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
FRANK	It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.

FRANK	What?
MELVIN	What? Look at you... You sense a mark.
FRANK	Hey -- you called me... I...
MELVIN	About a dog.
FRANK	Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
MELVIN	Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
FRANK	It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
MELVIN	Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
FRANK	Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
MELVIN	Think white and get serious.

FRANK	Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
MELVIN	Like the wind but I'm not doing it.

MELVIN	Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
FRANK	If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
MELVIN	Last word freak.

HEAD WAITER	Good evening.
MELVIN	Hi. You have hard shells, right?

HEAD WAITER	Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
MELVIN	What?
HEAD WAITER	They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.

HEAD WAITER	Actually, I don't think so.
MELVIN	Wait here.

HEAD WAITER	Shall I get her for you?
MELVIN	No, it's all right. I'll just watch.

JACKIE	How you doing, great one?
SIMON	I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.

SIMON	No. Please, don't force him.
JACKIE	You little stinker. He's given you everything.

SIMON	Sorry. What are those cards?
JACKIE	Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
SIMON	Terrify me?
JACKIE	See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.

JACKIE	The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
SIMON	Well, I can't reach them.

JACKIE	Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
SIMON	I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.

MELVIN	Is he dead yet?
NORA	No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
MELVIN	Absolutely.
NORA	Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
MELVIN	Sure thing.
NORA	You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
MELVIN	Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.

RAY	Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
MELVIN	How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
RAY	What?
MELVIN	Just move on. No one here killed him.
RAY	Oh, is he dead?
MELVIN	Ask him.
RAY	We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.

SIMON	Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
MELVIN	What's he look like?

SIMON	My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
MELVIN	I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.

SIMON	Which color was that?
MELVIN	Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...

SIMON	Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
MELVIN	How're you doing?
SIMON	Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.

SIMON	Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
MELVIN	'Love was... '

MELVIN	Yeeeess!!!
SIMON	Maybe this can wait.

SIMON	I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
MELVIN	Well, that's a load off.

SIMON	Did you... do something to him?
MELVIN	Do you realize that I work at him?
SIMON	No, I didn't.
MELVIN	Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
SIMON	No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
MELVIN	Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
SIMON	Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
MELVIN	Okay, then.

MELVIN	That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
SIMON	Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

SIMON	Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
MELVIN	I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
SIMON	Verdell?

MELVIN	Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
SIMON	Thank you for walking him.

SIMON	If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
MELVIN	It smells like shit in here?
SIMON	Go away.
MELVIN	That cleaning woman doesn't...
SIMON	Please, just leave.
MELVIN	Where are all your queer party friends?
SIMON	Get out.

SIMON	Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
MELVIN	Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
SIMON	Rot in hell, Melvin.
MELVIN	No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.

MELVIN	Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
SIMON	Get out.
MELVIN	Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me...  it's not affection. It's a trick.

MELVIN	I carry bacon in my pocket.
SIMON	Oh, my gosh.
MELVIN	Now we'll both call him.
SIMON	Come on, sweetheart...
MELVIN	Yo, yo, yo...

SIMON	Would you leave now, please?
MELVIN	Stupid dog.  I don't get it.

MELVIN	I brought you Chinese soup.
SIMON	Thanks.
MELVIN	I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
SIMON	Got any easier questions?

MELVIN	I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
SIMON	But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
MELVIN	Yeah...

SIMON	I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
MELVIN	Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.

SIMON	That's very thoughtful.
MELVIN	Never a break. Never.

SIMON	Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
MELVIN	This stuff is pointless.

SIMON	Not it at all, really.
MELVIN	Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.

MELVIN	Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
SIMON	Melvin...
MELVIN	Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
SIMON	You consider your life easy.
MELVIN	I give you that one...  Nice packing.

MELVIN	I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
SIMON	... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.

MELVIN	... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
SIMON	I'm going back with you.

MELVIN	What are you talking about? You got real problems.
SIMON	I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.

MELVIN	Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
SIMON	Another place where?
MELVIN	Does it matter?

MELVIN	I told you to go on in.
SIMON	Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...

MELVIN	I think you gotta camp it here...
SIMON	What are you talking about?

SIMON	Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
MELVIN	They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
SIMON	I love you.

SIMON	Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
MELVIN	Look, we both want the dog -- and...

MELVIN	You going to come talk to me or not?
SIMON	I'm coming.

SIMON	What did she say?
MELVIN	I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
SIMON	Because...  ... you love her?
MELVIN	No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
SIMON	Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
MELVIN	I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
SIMON	Did you like it that much?
MELVIN	It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
SIMON	Picking on me won't help.
MELVIN	Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
SIMON	But you know where you're lucky?
MELVIN	Absolutely not.
SIMON	You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
MELVIN	Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
SIMON	Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
MELVIN	Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

SIMON	What's wrong?
MELVIN	I forgot to lock the door.

ZOE	I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
MELVIN	What's it mean?
ZOE	That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
MELVIN	Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
ZOE	Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?

ZOE	How do you write women so well?
MELVIN	I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.

SIMON	Exactly what is your previous experience?
VINCENT	How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.

SIMON	Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
VINCENT	The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
SIMON	No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.

VINCENT	So you're practically finished, huh?
SIMON	Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.

VINCENT	Wait -- I want to see the painting.
SIMON	Just a second -- he has to go.
VINCENT	Please!! NO!!!

SIMON	Why are you doing this?
VINCENT	No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...

ALLENBY	The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
CHANCE	I understand. I've seen it done before.
ALLENBY	Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.

CHANCE	You were wrong, it did hurt.
ALLENBY	But not for long...

ALLENBY	It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
CHANCE	Yes. I think so, too.
ALLENBY	However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
CHANCE	I see.

ALLENBY	You can pull your trousers up, now.
CHANCE	Oh, fine.
ALLENBY	Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
CHANCE	... Straight out?
ALLENBY	Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
CHANCE	Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
ALLENBY	Thomas? Who's Thomas?
CHANCE	Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
ALLENBY	An attorney?
CHANCE	Yes.
ALLENBY	Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
CHANCE	There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
ALLENBY	Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
CHANCE	Thank you.
ALLENBY	Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
CHANCE	Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
ALLENBY	Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
CHANCE	No.

ALLENBY	I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
CHANCE	Yes, I will.

ALLENBY	... And please call me Robert.
CHANCE	Yes, Robert. I will.

ALLENBY	Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
CHANCE	It's fine today, Robert.
ALLENBY	Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.

ALLENBY	I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
CHANCE	Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.

ALLENBY	... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
CHANCE	Hardly any, Robert.

ALLENBY	... Were you going somewhere?
CHANCE	No, Robert.
ALLENBY	... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
CHANCE	Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
ALLENBY	... Oh? You've heard?
CHANCE	Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
ALLENBY	He does, does he?
CHANCE	Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
ALLENBY	Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
CHANCE	How do I know when it's ten o'clock?

ALLENBY	... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
CHANCE	Thank you, Robert.

CHANCE	I would like to walk today.
ALLENBY	Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
CHANCE	Oh, really?

ALLENBY	... He's gone, Chauncey.
CHANCE	Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
ALLENBY	Yes, I suppose that's true.

CHANCE	Will you be leaving now, Robert?
ALLENBY	In a day or two, yes.
CHANCE	Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
ALLENBY	... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
CHANCE	Yes. I love Eve very much.
ALLENBY	I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
CHANCE	Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.

RAND	I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
ALLENBY	To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
RAND	Of course! By kid-lawyers!

RAND	... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
ALLENBY	That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.

ALLENBY	Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
RAND	We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!

ALLENBY	And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
RAND	In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...

RAND	No more, Robert... No more needles...
ALLENBY	It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
RAND	I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...

ALLENBY	Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
EVE	I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
ALLENBY	A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
EVE	Stay here? Is that necessary?
ALLENBY	Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
EVE	Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
ALLENBY	How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
EVE	He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
ALLENBY	At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
EVE	Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
ALLENBY	No, Eve... I'm sorry.

ALLENBY	... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
EVE	... But he's...?
ALLENBY	He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...

ALLENBY	... He walked off...
EVE	Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...

EVE	... Do you think we should look for him?
ALLENBY	I don't think so, he should be along soon...
EVE	I wish he were here...

EVE	We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
ALLENBY	You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
EVE	I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
ALLENBY	I think we'd better go look for him.  David!

FRANKLIN	... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
ALLENBY	I have no idea...
FRANKLIN	Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
ALLENBY	Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
FRANKLIN	Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
ALLENBY	I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
FRANKLIN	Of course, Doctor, I understand.
ALLENBY	Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
FRANKLIN	Certainly, glad to be of help.

PRESIDENT	Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
BALDWIN	Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
PRESIDENT	Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?

BALDWIN	I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
PRESIDENT	And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
BALDWIN	Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
PRESIDENT	Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.

CHANCE	Do you know Raphael?
BILLINGS	No sir, I don't believe I do.
CHANCE	Oh. I have a message for him.
BILLINGS	Yes, sir.
CHANCE	A Black man gave me the message.
BILLINGS	Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.

CHANCE	I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
BILLINGS	Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.

MRS. AUBREY	Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
CHANCE	Thank you.
MRS. AUBREY	Would you care to take it, sir?
CHANCE	Yes.

MRS. AUBREY	Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
CHANCE	Oh, yes.
MRS. AUBREY	Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
CHANCE	Yes, I have seen that show on television.
MRS. AUBREY	Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
CHANCE	Yes. I would like to be on that show.
MRS. AUBREY	Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
CHANCE	No. I like this attic very much.

EVE	... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
CHANCE	There's no need for a hospital.
EVE	Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.

EVE	I hope you're comfortable.
CHANCE	Yes. I am.
EVE	These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
CHANCE	Yes. He's a very careful driver.
EVE	... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
CHANCE	It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
EVE	I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
CHANCE	Your family doctor?
EVE	Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
CHANCE	I agree.
EVE	Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?

EVE	Would you care for a drink?
CHANCE	Yes. Thank you.

CHANCE	I would like to watch television.
EVE	Oh? Certainly...

EVE	Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
CHANCE	Hello, Eve.

EVE	May I ask your name?
CHANCE	My name is Chance.
EVE	Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
CHANCE	No. I'm a gardener.
EVE	Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
CHANCE	No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
EVE	Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.

EVE	Did you lose something?
CHANCE	Yes. I lost my remote control.
EVE	Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...

EVE	... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
CHANCE	I like to watch. This is fine.

EVE	I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
CHANCE	Yes.
EVE	I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...

EVE	Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
CHANCE	No. It won't do that.
EVE	... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
CHANCE	No. The Old Man died and Louise left.

EVE	I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
CHANCE	No. I like it here.

EVE	Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
CHANCE	I am a very good gardener.

EVE	Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
CHANCE	Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
EVE	... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
CHANCE	Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
EVE	Yes... I know, Chauncey.
CHANCE	I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
EVE	He does...?
CHANCE	Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?

EVE	... Why... No, I don't think so...
CHANCE	That's good.

EVE	... Good night, Chauncey.
CHANCE	Good night, Eve.

EVE	Chauncey!
CHANCE	Hello, Eve.
EVE	Your leg must be getting better.
CHANCE	Yes. It's feeling much better now.
EVE	Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
CHANCE	Fine. He's very nice.
EVE	Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.

EVE	... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
CHANCE	Yes.
EVE	Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
CHANCE	He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
EVE	Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
CHANCE	... Mentor...?

EVE	Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
CHANCE	Yes. I was.
EVE	I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
CHANCE	Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
EVE	Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
CHANCE	Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
EVE	Of course.

CHANCE	What is that?
EVE	Our greenhouse.
CHANCE	Oh, I like that very much.
EVE	Yes, so do we.

EVE	... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
CHANCE	So am I, Eve.

EVE	I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
CHANCE	Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.

EVE	Chauncey...
CHANCE	Hello, Eve.
EVE	Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
CHANCE	Thank you, Eve.
EVE	And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
CHANCE	How is Ben feeling?
EVE	He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
CHANCE	That's good. I like to watch, too.
EVE	I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.

EVE	... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
CHANCE	No, thank you.
EVE	Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
CHANCE	I see.
EVE	... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...

EVE	... Good night, Chauncey.
CHANCE	Good night, Eve.

EVE	Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
CHANCE	No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
EVE	Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
CHANCE	I like the President. He is a very nice man.
EVE	I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
CHANCE	No, Eve. I like you to be here.

EVE	... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
CHANCE	Yes, Eve. I know that.

EVE	... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
CHANCE	Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
EVE	I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
CHANCE	Yes. That could be true.
EVE	... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...

EVE	I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
CHANCE	Thank you, Eve.

CHANCE	Yes.
EVE	Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
CHANCE	Hello, Dennis.

EVE	Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
CHANCE	No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
EVE	Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
CHANCE	He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
EVE	It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.

EVE	I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
CHANCE	Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
EVE	... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
CHANCE	Thank you.

EVE	I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
CHANCE	I like to watch.
EVE	To watch...? To watch me...?
CHANCE	Yes. I like to watch.
EVE	... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
CHANCE	Yes. It's very good, Eve.
EVE	... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?

EVE	Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
CHANCE	That's very interesting, Eve.

EVE	Chauncey! Chauncey!
CHANCE	Hello, Eve.

EVE	Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
CHANCE	Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.

COURTNEY	Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
CHANCE	Hello, Sid.
COURTNEY	I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
CHANCE	No. I'm not busy.
COURTNEY	Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
CHANCE	The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
COURTNEY	Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
CHANCE	I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
COURTNEY	Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
CHANCE	Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.

COURTNEY	I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
CHANCE	I have nothing more to say.

HULL	Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
CHANCE	Hello, Morton.

HULL	Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
CHANCE	I see.
HULL	Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
CHANCE	Yes. It's a very good show.
HULL	I'm glad you like it, Mr. Gardiner.

DENNIS' VOICE	Can you see well?
CHANCE	Yes, very well, thank you.
DENNIS' VOICE	Do you like it?
CHANCE	Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
DENNIS' VOICE	... Are you sure you like it?
CHANCE	Yes, I do, it's very good.
DENNIS' VOICE	Really? Really!!!

CHANCE	Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
DENNIS' VOICE	I don't want Robert.
CHANCE	I see.
DENNIS' VOICE	Your foot! Give me your foot!!

SKRAPINOV	You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
CHANCE	I agree.
SKRAPINOV	How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?

SKRAPINOV	Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
CHANCE	Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.

SKRAPINOV	I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
CHANCE	Ben is very ill.
SKRAPINOV	Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.

SKRAPINOV	... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
CHANCE	Yes, I agree, I think so too.
SKRAPINOV	To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
CHANCE	Yes, I understand.
SKRAPINOV	And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
CHANCE	We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
SKRAPINOV	Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
CHANCE	I certainly do.
SKRAPINOV	Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
CHANCE	Do you think so? Do you think so?
SKRAPINOV	So you know Krylov!

SKRAPINOV	So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
CHANCE	Oh, good.
SKRAPINOV	Yes, it is very good!
CHANCE	Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
SKRAPINOV	Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
CHANCE	Yes. I like that name very much.
SKRAPINOV	And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!

CHANCE	Yes, Eve. That would be good.
SKRAPINOV	We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
CHANCE	Thank you.

RAND	Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
CHANCE	... I see.

CHANCE	I feel very good in here.
RAND	Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
CHANCE	Yes. I like that very much.

RAND	Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
CHANCE	Yes. You look very sick.

RAND	... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
CHANCE	I agree.
RAND	... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
CHANCE	Yes. I am very hungry.
RAND	... So am I, my boy - so am I.

CHANCE	No, thank you. My house has been closed.
RAND	Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
CHANCE	Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
RAND	What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!

RAND	That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
CHANCE	Yes. Chauncey is fine.
RAND	And I'm Ben.

RAND	Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
CHANCE	I see. I would like to work in your garden.

RAND	A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
CHANCE	Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
RAND	Bravo!
CHANCE	But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
RAND	Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.

CHANCE	It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
RAND	Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.

CHANCE	No, Ben.
RAND	Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
CHANCE	I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
RAND	... Oh?  Robert, take a look, would you?

RAND	Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
CHANCE	Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
RAND	Well, that's good news, my boy.
CHANCE	You're looking much better today, Ben.
RAND	Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
CHANCE	I understand.
RAND	No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
CHANCE	Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.

RAND	Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
CHANCE	I see, Ben.
RAND	... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...

RAND	I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
CHANCE	Yes. That is correct.

RAND	He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
CHANCE	Yes, Ben - he is.
RAND	He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
CHANCE	I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.

RAND	... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
CHANCE	No, Ben.
RAND	Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
CHANCE	I understand.
RAND	And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
CHANCE	Thank you, Ben.
RAND	And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.

CHANCE	Certainly, Ben.
RAND	Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
CHANCE	Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
RAND	Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.

RAND	... Chauncey... Chauncey...
CHANCE	Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?

RAND	... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
CHANCE	Oh, I see.
RAND	Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
CHANCE	A flower...
RAND	She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
CHANCE	Yes. I would like to do that.
RAND	... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...

DENNIS	We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
CHANCE	I like to watch.
DENNIS	Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
CHANCE	Yes. I like to watch very much.
DENNIS	Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
CHANCE	I want to tell Eve.
DENNIS	Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
CHANCE	Yes.
DENNIS	Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.

STIEGLER	Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
CHANCE	Hello, Ronald.
STIEGLER	Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
CHANCE	I can't write.
STIEGLER	Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
CHANCE	I can't read.
STIEGLER	Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
CHANCE	Yes. I like to watch.
STIEGLER	Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
CHANCE	What sort of bed is it?

SMYTHE	May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
CHANCE	Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
SMYTHE	... Sir?
CHANCE	Yes.

SMYTHE	... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
CHANCE	Yes, I would like to see Ben.
SMYTHE	Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.

HAYES	Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
CHANCE	Yes.

HAYES	... Then you really are a gardener?
CHANCE	Yes.
HAYES	Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
CHANCE	Oh. Thank you.

HAYES	What about money?
CHANCE	I never needed money.

HAYES	Some pictures...?
CHANCE	Yes. Of men and women.
HAYES	... Oh.

HAYES	How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
CHANCE	No.

HAYES	Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
CHANCE	No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.

CHANCE	I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
HAYES	It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
CHANCE	Yes. I have seen styles on television.

HAYES	Good day, Mr. Chance.
CHANCE	Good day, Sally.

JEFFREY	This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
CHANCE	No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.

JEFFREY	Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
CHANCE	It's very sore.

JEFFREY	I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
CHANCE	I agree.
JEFFREY	Let's have a look, do you mind?
CHANCE	Of course. I would like to look.

JEFFREY	It's starting to swell, is it painful?
CHANCE	Yes.

JEFFREY	Please, sir.
CHANCE	I've never ridden in an automobile.
JEFFREY	I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
CHANCE	... Yes. You can take me.
JEFFREY	Very good.

CHANCE	... My suitcase.
JEFFREY	Yes sir. I'll take care of that.

CHANCE	Does it have a television?
WILSON	No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
CHANCE	I see.

CHANCE	How long do we stay in here?
WILSON	How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...

CHANCE	... That is a very small room.
WILSON	Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
CHANCE	Yes. It seems to be.

CHANCE	... Hmmm... Elevator.
WILSON	... Yes sir - elevator!

LOUISE	... Evening, Chance.
CHANCE	... Good evening, Louise.

LOUISE	... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
CHANCE	I see.
LOUISE	I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...

LOUISE	... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
CHANCE	Is his back feeling better?

CHANCE	Good morning, Louise.
LOUISE	He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
CHANCE	... I see.
LOUISE	Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
CHANCE	Yes. I've seen that done.
LOUISE	Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
CHANCE	... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.

LOUISE	Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook?  That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
CHANCE	Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
LOUISE	Well, ain't that the truth...
CHANCE	Yes. It is.

LOUISE	Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
CHANCE	Yes, I'm very hungry.
LOUISE	Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
CHANCE	I'm going to work in the garden.

LOUISE	... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
CHANCE	Yes.
LOUISE	You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...

DUPONT	Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
CHANCE	Yes.
DUPONT	I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
CHANCE	You're welcome.
DUPONT	I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
CHANCE	Yes. That is surprising.
DUPONT	... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
CHANCE	I hope so.
DUPONT	Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
CHANCE	No. I don't object.
DUPONT	Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
CHANCE	Which view?

DUPONT	Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
CHANCE	Yes. I was there with Ben.
DUPONT	I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
CHANCE	Yes.
DUPONT	Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
CHANCE	Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.

DUPONT	Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
CHANCE	Yes. We need a very good gardener.

DUPONT	Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
CHANCE	Thank you.

DUPONT	I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
CHANCE	I am a very serious gardener.

CHANCE	Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
FRANKLIN	... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.

FRANKLIN	... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
CHANCE	Yes, Thomas - I understand.

FRANKLIN	... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
CHANCE	Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
FRANKLIN	Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
CHANCE	Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
FRANKLIN	Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
CHANCE	I see...
FRANKLIN	... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
CHANCE	I live here.
FRANKLIN	You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
CHANCE	Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
FRANKLIN	... How long have you been living here?
CHANCE	Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
FRANKLIN	Since you were a child?
CHANCE	Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.

FRANKLIN	Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
CHANCE	No.
FRANKLIN	How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
CHANCE	Compensated...?
FRANKLIN	How were you paid?
CHANCE	I was given meals, and a home...

FRANKLIN	Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
CHANCE	No, I do not have any of those.
FRANKLIN	Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
CHANCE	I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
FRANKLIN	... Joe? Who's Joe?
CHANCE	Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
FRANKLIN	1952...?
CHANCE	Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.

FRANKLIN	Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
CHANCE	Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
FRANKLIN	Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
CHANCE	Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
FRANKLIN	... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
CHANCE	You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?

FRANKLIN	Have you served in the Army?
CHANCE	No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.

CHANCE	Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
FRANKLIN	Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
CHANCE	No, I don't think so. And I have planted and shaped all the hedges, and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers.

FRANKLIN	... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
CHANCE	No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.

CHANCE	The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
FRANKLIN	Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
CHANCE	Yes, I understand.

FRANKLIN	What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?
CHANCE	I would like to stay and work in my garden.

FRANKLIN	Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
CHANCE	I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
FRANKLIN	Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.

CHANCE	No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
FRANKLIN	Come now, Mr. Chance.
CHANCE	I have no claim, Thomas.
FRANKLIN	But you won't sign, correct?
CHANCE	Correct.
FRANKLIN	Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
CHANCE	Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
FRANKLIN	I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...

CHANCE	Good morning, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT	... Hello.

CHANCE	You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT	... Oh, really...

PRESIDENT	Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
CHANCE	Yes, I will.
PRESIDENT	Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...

PRESIDENT	Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
CHANCE	As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
PRESIDENT	... In the garden?
CHANCE	That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
PRESIDENT	... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?

CHANCE	Yes. It has.
PRESIDENT	... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
CHANCE	Yes. I will.
PRESIDENT	Wonderful, we'll all look forward to seeing you.  Is Eve around? I'd like to say hello.

COURTNEY	... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
KINNEY	... Nothing.
COURTNEY	... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
KINNEY	... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...

KINNEY	... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
COURTNEY	Try again.
KINNEY	Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
COURTNEY	Try again.
KINNEY	Sid, it's useless!
COURTNEY	I said - try again.

EVE	Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
RAND	Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
EVE	No headaches?
RAND	No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
EVE	You heard?
RAND	I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
EVE	Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
RAND	Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
EVE	Do you feel well enough for that?
RAND	Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?

EVE	Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
RAND	Do you need a secretary?

RAND	I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
EVE	... Yes, I am, Ben.
RAND	That's good... That's good.

EVE	... Ben, really...
RAND	... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.

WILSON	Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
EVE	Good evening, Wilson.
WILSON	I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
EVE	Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.

EVE	Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
WILSON	Yes, ma'am.
EVE	I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.

SOPHIE	Eve, child! How nice of you to come.
EVE	Hello, Sophie.

SOPHIE	And look who you brought with!
EVE	Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
SOPHIE	Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
EVE	Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.

SOPHIE	Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
EVE	Would you two excuse me for a moment?

PRESIDENT	... How are the kids getting along?
FIRST LADY	Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
PRESIDENT	Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
FIRST LADY	Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
PRESIDENT	Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...

FIRST LADY	... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
PRESIDENT	No, that won't do any good.
FIRST LADY	... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
PRESIDENT	Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
FIRST LADY	It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
PRESIDENT	It's not that, I just...

PRESIDENT	I can certainly understand that...
FIRST LADY	Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...

HAYES	... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
FRANKLIN	Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
HAYES	... Would you take me on a tour?
FRANKLIN	Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.

FRANKLIN	... What do you make of all this?
HAYES	I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
FRANKLIN	... Yeah...
HAYES	... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
FRANKLIN	Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.

FRANKLIN	It's that gardener!
JOHANNA	Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
FRANKLIN	No! He's a real gardener!
JOHANNA	He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.

JOHANNA	... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
FRANKLIN	Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
JOHANNA	Good night.
FRANKLIN	Look, Johanna...
JOHANNA	I said good night!

SKRAPINOV	Yes? What have you found?
KARPATOV	We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
SKRAPINOV	Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
KARPATOV	Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
SKRAPINOV	What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
KARPATOV	There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.

SKRAPINOV	But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
KARPATOV	Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
SKRAPINOV	I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
KARPATOV	Clearly, yes comrade.
SKRAPINOV	Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
KARPATOV	Very good, Your Excellency.

PRESIDENT	Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
KAUFMAN	Gardiner, yes, sir.
PRESIDENT	And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
KAUFMAN	No problem, Chief.

PRESIDENT	... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
KAUFMAN	Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
PRESIDENT	He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
KAUFMAN	Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
PRESIDENT	I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
KAUFMAN	Right, Chief.

PRESIDENT	This is not what I requested.
KAUFMAN	No, sir.
PRESIDENT	This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
KAUFMAN	Right, Chief.
PRESIDENT	So...? Where the hell is it?
KAUFMAN	We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
PRESIDENT	What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
KAUFMAN	Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
PRESIDENT	I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
KAUFMAN	Yes, sir.

PRESIDENT	... So what does all that add up to?
KAUFMAN	Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
PRESIDENT	I would appreciate that.

KAUFMAN	Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
PRESIDENT	Oh? What?
KAUFMAN	We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
PRESIDENT	Good. Anything else?
KAUFMAN	Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.

NOVOGROD	The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
SKRAPINOV	That could be possible...
NOVOGROD	But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
SKRAPINOV	A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
NOVOGROD	That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
SKRAPINOV	Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
NOVOGROD	You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
SKRAPINOV	Thank you, Colonel.
NOVOGROD	Let us toast to the success of the coup.

PRESIDENT	Ben!
RAND	... Mr. President, how good to see you.
PRESIDENT	It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
RAND	I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
PRESIDENT	Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.

RAND	Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
PRESIDENT	Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.

PRESIDENT	I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
RAND	Yes, I did.
PRESIDENT	... Well?
RAND	Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
PRESIDENT	Well, Ben... I...
RAND	I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
PRESIDENT	That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.

RAND	... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
PRESIDENT	It's that serious, huh?
RAND	I'm afraid so.

RAND	No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
PRESIDENT	I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
RAND	Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
PRESIDENT	Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!

RAND	You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
PRESIDENT	Take care of yourself, Ben.
RAND	You take care too, Bobby.
PRESIDENT	Mr. Gardiner...

AGENT	John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
MALKOVICH	This is my fiancee Maxine.

MALKOVICH	I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
AGENT	Okay.
MALKOVICH	I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
AGENT	Oh yeah, he's good.
MALKOVICH	... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.

CABBIE	Say, aren't you that actor guy?
MALKOVICH	Yeah.
CABBIE	John Makel...

MALKOVICH	Malkovich.
CABBIE	Malkovich!

MALKOVICH	Thank you.
CABBIE	The one where you're that jewel thief.
MALKOVICH	I never played a jewel thief.
CABBIE	Who am I thinking of?
MALKOVICH	I don't know.
CABBIE	I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
MALKOVICH	Yeah, okay.

ERROLL	Hello, I'm here about the ad.
CRAIG	Please, have a seat.

ERROLL	When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
CRAIG	Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
ERROLL	Oh, this is just the medical breakthrough I've been waiting for. Are their any side effects? Please say no! Please say no!

ERROLL	Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
CRAIG	Tell your friends.
ERROLL	Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!

CRAIG	Morning.
LOTTE	Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
CRAIG	Enjoy.
LOTTE	Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
CRAIG	We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
LOTTE	Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
CRAIG	The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
LOTTE	Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
CRAIG	What?
LOTTE	Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
CRAIG	Which one is Elijah again?
LOTTE	The monkey.
CRAIG	Yeah. Okay.

LOTTE	Is the trial date set?
CRAIG	May 11th.

LOTTE	Why'd you do it, Craig?
CRAIG	I'm a puppeteer.

LOTTE	Why, Craig. why?
CRAIG	I... puppeteer.

LOTTE	Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
CRAIG	Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
LOTTE	Seven-ish
CRAIG	We have to make it an early night.
LOTTE	They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
CRAIG	Hmmm.
LOTTE	Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
CRAIG	Hmmm.

CRAIG	Yeah, just an idea I had.
LOTTE	She's very beautiful.
CRAIG	Just an idea I had.

CRAIG	Hi.
LOTTE	Hi.
CRAIG	Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. WeÂre supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.

LOTTE	Did you eat?
CRAIG	Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
LOTTE	I was worried.
CRAIG	I'm sorry. How was your evening?
LOTTE	Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
CRAIG	The ferret?
LOTTE	The iguana.
CRAIG	Right.
LOTTE	I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
CRAIG	Yeah. You want a beer?
LOTTE	No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
CRAIG	All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
LOTTE	'kay.

LOTTE	Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
CRAIG	Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
LOTTE	I want to try.
CRAIG	What?
LOTTE	I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
CRAIG	Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
LOTTE	Now?
CRAIG	Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.

CRAIG	I'll meet you on the turnpike.
LOTTE	I'm scared.

LOTTE	I have to go back.
CRAIG	Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
LOTTE	I have to go back now.
CRAIG	We'll talk about it in the car.

LOTTE	I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
CRAIG	You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
LOTTE	I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
CRAIG	Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.

CRAIG	Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
LOTTE	Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?

CRAIG	Why aren't you at work?
LOTTE	I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
CRAIG	What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
LOTTE	Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
CRAIG	This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.

CRAIG	How was it?
LOTTE	I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
CRAIG	Why?
LOTTE	Don't crowd me, Craig.

CRAIG	So how was it? What was he doing?
LOTTE	Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
CRAIG	You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
LOTTE	You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
CRAIG	I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
LOTTE	It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. WeÂll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.

LOTTE	Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
CRAIG	After dinner I'll show you my puppets.

LOTTE	What are you doing?
CRAIG	I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
LOTTE	Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
CRAIG	You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
LOTTE	I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
CRAIG	What?
LOTTE	I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
CRAIG	No they're not.
LOTTE	You've always hated the animals.
CRAIG	You've always loved the animals.
LOTTE	I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
CRAIG	What's that?
LOTTE	Us, of course.

CRAIG	What about Maxine?
LOTTE	Fuck Maxine.
CRAIG	We wish.

CRAIG	You were him last night, weren't you?
LOTTE	Yes.
CRAIG	And he was with her.
LOTTE	We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
CRAIG	We?
LOTTE	Me and John.
CRAIG	Don't forget me.
LOTTE	Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.

LOTTE	I'm sorry. That was nasty.
CRAIG	Life is confusing, isn't it?
LOTTE	Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
CRAIG	I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.

LOTTE	I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
CRAIG	Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
LOTTE	Suck my dick!
CRAIG	Shut up!

CRAIG	Tell her you need to see her.
LOTTE	You bastard.

CRAIG	Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
LOTTE	What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.

CRAIG	It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
LOTTE	It'll never happen, fuckface.
CRAIG	Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
LOTTE	What's that?
CRAIG	I'm a puppeteer.

LOTTE	Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
CRAIG	Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
LOTTE	You fell in love with her first.
CRAIG	Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
LOTTE	You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
CRAIG	That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
LOTTE	Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
CRAIG	Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
LOTTE	I need a shower.
CRAIG	I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
LOTTE	You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
CRAIG	I love you so much.

LOTTE	My God!
CRAIG	I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
LOTTE	I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
CRAIG	He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
LOTTE	It's Elijah.
CRAIG	The iguana?
LOTTE	The monkey.
CRAIG	Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
LOTTE	A better friend.
CRAIG	I'm sorry for everything.
LOTTE	It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
CRAIG	You came up here looking for the portal?
LOTTE	Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
CRAIG	And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
LOTTE	You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
CRAIG	I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
LOTTE	I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
CRAIG	You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
LOTTE	People make mistakes.
CRAIG	I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
LOTTE	I know.
CRAIG	I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
LOTTE	Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.

MALKOVICH	Maxine...
CRAIG	I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.

CRAIG	Holy shit, yes!
MALKOVICH	Holy shit, yes!
CRAIG	Holy shit! He said what I said!
MALKOVICH	Holy shit! He said what I said!

CRAIG	Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
MALKOVICH	Simulates?
CRAIG	Sure, after a fashion.
MALKOVICH	Let me try.
CRAIG	You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
MALKOVICH	Let me try!

CRAIG	So how was it?
MALKOVICH	That... was... no... simulation.
CRAIG	I know. I'm sorry...
MALKOVICH	I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
CRAIG	Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
MALKOVICH	This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
CRAIG	With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
MALKOVICH	It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!

FLORIS	Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
CRAIG	No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
FLORIS	Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
CRAIG	Schwartz.
FLORIS	Pardon?
CRAIG	Schwartz.
FLORIS	I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
CRAIG	My name is Schwartz.
FLORIS	Money, Miss Warts?
CRAIG	Forget it.

FLORIS	Mr. Juarez?
CRAIG	Yes?
FLORIS	Yex?
CRAIG	I said "yes."
FLORIS	You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.

FLORIS	You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
CRAIG	I am a trained performer.
FLORIS	Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!

CRAIG	Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid IÂm in love with somebody else.
FLORIS	I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!

LESTER	Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
CRAIG	Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.

LESTER	Security.
CRAIG	No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
LESTER	She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what youÂre implying.
CRAIG	Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
LESTER	Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
CRAIG	Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
LESTER	You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
CRAIG	Glooph is not a letter, sir.
LESTER	Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.

CRAIG	You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
LESTER	Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
CRAIG	No.
LESTER	Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
CRAIG	No. I understand perfectly.
LESTER	Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
CRAIG	Just one. Why is this floor so short?
LESTER	Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.

LESTER	Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
CRAIG	I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
LESTER	One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
CRAIG	I'll keep that in mind, sir.
LESTER	No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
CRAIG	The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
LESTER	I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
CRAIG	Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
LESTER	All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.

LESTER	Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. ÂLadies,Â I begin. ÂI am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
CRAIG	Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
LESTER	Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
CRAIG	Yessir.
LESTER	Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
CRAIG	That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.

CRAIG	Dr. Lester. . .
LESTER	Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
CRAIG	Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
LESTER	Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
CRAIG	Thank you, sir.

CRAIG	Dr. Lester...
LESTER	More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
CRAIG	No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
LESTER	I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
CRAIG	No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
LESTER	And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
CRAIG	Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
LESTER	The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain ÂdoorsÂ which should never be opened.

LESTER	You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
CRAIG	Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
LESTER	There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
CRAIG	You're insane.
LESTER	I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.

CRAIG	Moving story.
MAXINE	Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
CRAIG	Is that true?
MAXINE	Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
CRAIG	Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
MAXINE	How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
CRAIG	Emily Dickinson.
MAXINE	I wouldn't know.

MAXINE	Yes, well...
CRAIG	You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
MAXINE	And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
CRAIG	No, really.
MAXINE	You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.

MAXINE	What?
CRAIG	I just wanted to say Âhi.Â  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
MAXINE	Yeah.
CRAIG	How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
MAXINE	Why not?
CRAIG	Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
MAXINE	Who told you?
CRAIG	I'm right?
MAXINE	Who told you?
CRAIG	That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
MAXINE	Somebody told you.
CRAIG	Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
MAXINE	I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
CRAIG	Maxine.

CRAIG	Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
MAXINE	Just.
CRAIG	Buy you a drink, Maxine?
MAXINE	You married?
CRAIG	Yeah. But enough about me.

CRAIG	What'll you have?
MAXINE	The usual, Barry.
CRAIG	I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.

CRAIG	I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
MAXINE	My tits?
CRAIG	No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
MAXINE	Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.

CRAIG	That's the usual?
MAXINE	DonÂt let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.

CRAIG	IÂm not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
MAXINE	You're a fag or a liar.
CRAIG	I mean, I am really attracted to you.
MAXINE	I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.

CRAIG	No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
MAXINE	Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.

MAXINE	So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
CRAIG	Well, I'm a puppeteer...

CRAIG	Hi.
MAXINE	You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
CRAIG	Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
MAXINE	Yikes.
CRAIG	Please, let me explain.

CRAIG	It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
MAXINE	You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.

CRAIG	Don't you want to know what happened to me?
MAXINE	No.

CRAIG	This is important!
MAXINE	It better be.

CRAIG	There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
MAXINE	Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
CRAIG	He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
MAXINE	What's he been in?
CRAIG	Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
MAXINE	Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
CRAIG	Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
MAXINE	Good. We'll sell tickets.
CRAIG	Tickets to Malkovich?
MAXINE	Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
CRAIG	But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
MAXINE	Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
CRAIG	You wanted to be partners with me?
MAXINE	Sure. It'd be fun.
CRAIG	Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
MAXINE	I'll protect you, Dollface.

MAXINE	Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
CRAIG	Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.

MAXINE	Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
CRAIG	My God.

CRAIG	This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
MAXINE	So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.

MAXINE	You're late.
CRAIG	Are you torturing me on purpose?
MAXINE	I've fallen in love.
CRAIG	I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
MAXINE	You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
CRAIG	You're evil, Maxine.
MAXINE	Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.

CRAIG	You're glowing again.
MAXINE	A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.

MAXINE	Lotte, this is so good...
CRAIG	Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.

MAXINE	Lotte? Is that you?
CRAIG	Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!

MAXINE	Let him try.
CRAIG	Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.

CRAIG	What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
MAXINE	How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.

CRAIG	But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
MAXINE	J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

WENDY	Hello, Don.
DON	Hello. Wendy.
WENDY	Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
DON	It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.

DON	So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
WENDY	Ha ha ha!

DON	Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
WENDY	Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what itÂs for.
DON	That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.

ELIJAH	You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
LOTTE	I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
ELIJAH	It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.

ELIJAH	Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
LOTTE	Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
ELIJAH	If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
LOTTE	Hush, sweetheart.

LOTTE	I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
ELIJAH	Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.

MAXINE	No.
ERROLL	Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
MAXINE	No. Don't be an ass.
ERROLL	Can I be anyone I want?
MAXINE	You can be John Malkovich.
ERROLL	Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
MAXINE	Two hundred dollars, please.
ERROLL	Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!

FLEMMER	Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
LESTER	And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
FLEMMER	Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
LESTER	Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
FLEMMER	Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.

FLEMMER	Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
LESTER	We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
FLEMMER	Vegas? What'd you think?
LESTER	The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
FLEMMER	Impressions? Those are hard.
LESTER	Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
FLEMMER	I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
LESTER	A scary dream?
FLEMMER	No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
LESTER	I like that.

LESTER	How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
FLEMMER	No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
LESTER	What kind of circumstances?
FLEMMER	Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
LESTER	The Great Mantini?
FLEMMER	No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
LESTER	Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
FLEMMER	But I think I have another plan.
LESTER	Do tell. I love a good plan.
FLEMMER	Why are you being like this?

LESTER	I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
FLEMMER	Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
LESTER	Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
FLEMMER	I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
LESTER	I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
FLEMMER	Fine. Let's drop it.
LESTER	Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
FLEMMER	Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
LESTER	Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.

LESTER	Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
FLORIS	Gehginnis ondah foam?
LESTER	Forget it.
FLORIS	Fork ah did?
LESTER	Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.

LESTER	Yes, my dear?
FLORIS	Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
LESTER	Thank you, Floris.
FLORIS	Think, Jew florist?
LESTER	Good morning, Lotte!

HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	Do you dream often?
MALKOVICH	Do you?
HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
MALKOVICH	Says who?
HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET	Says me. Do you dream often?
MALKOVICH	Do you?

MALKOVICH	It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
KEVIN BACON	I'm sure you're not going crazy.
MALKOVICH	Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
KEVIN BACON	Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
MALKOVICH	Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
KEVIN BACON	You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
MALKOVICH	I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
KEVIN BACON	Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
MALKOVICH	I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
KEVIN BACON	You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
MALKOVICH	I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
KEVIN BACON	All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
MALKOVICH	I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
KEVIN BACON	The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.

WOMAN #1	You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
LESTER	Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.

LESTER	Anybody else?
WOMAN #1	Do we get to wear a crown?
LESTER	But of course.
WOMAN #1	Count me in.
LESTER	Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.

LESTER	Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
LOTTE	Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
LESTER	Oh, be still my heart.
LOTTE	Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
LESTER	With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.

LOTTE	I'm getting divorced.
LESTER	No you mustn't, my child.
LOTTE	But why, Son of Malkovich?
LESTER	We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.

LOTTE	I blew it, Dr. Lester.
LESTER	You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
LOTTE	But now we've lost access to Craig.
LESTER	My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.

LESTER	You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
LOTTE	Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
LESTER	Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
LOTTE	No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
LESTER	What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
LOTTE	No, I didn't know that.
LESTER	Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
LOTTE	No.
LESTER	Oh, sorry. Right this way.

LESTER	Aaaahhhh, the portal!
LOTTE	You bastard!

LESTER	No! Don't harm the vessel!
LOTTE	It's Craig in there, I can tell.
LESTER	I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.

LESTER	Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
LOTTE	Why not? I need to get in there!
LESTER	I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
LOTTE	That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
LESTER	I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.

MAXINE	Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
LOTTE	Yes, Hi.

LOTTE	Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
MAXINE	Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."

LOTTE	Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
MAXINE	Let her go, Craig. I mean Âhim."

MAXINE	And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
LOTTE	I've never been looked at like this by a woman.

MAXINE	Ah.
LOTTE	After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.

MAXINE	Yes?
LOTTE	I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
MAXINE	When?
LOTTE	Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.

LOTTE	Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
MAXINE	I love you, Lotte.
LOTTE	Maxine...

MAXINE	J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
LOTTE	I have to see you.
MAXINE	Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.

LOTTE	We have to meet.
MAXINE	One hour.

LOTTE	Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
MAXINE	Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
LOTTE	But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
MAXINE	I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.

MANTINI	Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
MALKOVICH	Did you see the reviews?
MANTINI	Yeah, I saw them
MALKOVICH	Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.

MALKOVICH	She's not available.
MANTINI	We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

MALKOVICH	How do we do that?
MANTINI	A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
MALKOVICH	What's the play?
MANTINI	Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
MALKOVICH	Never heard of it.
MANTINI	Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
MALKOVICH	Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
MANTINI	Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
MALKOVICH	I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
MANTINI	Great then.
MALKOVICH	Is there dancing?
MANTINI	No.
MALKOVICH	Who needs dancing?

MALKOVICH	Yeah?
MAXINE	Mr. Malkovich?
MALKOVICH	Who's calling?
MAXINE	You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
MALKOVICH	How'd you get this number?
MAXINE	It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...

MALKOVICH	Can I get you a drink?
MAXINE	Whatever you're having.

MAXINE	Thanks so much for coming over.
MALKOVICH	Oh, I'm really glad you called.

MAXINE	So, do you enjoy being an actor?
MALKOVICH	Oh sure. It's very rewarding...

MALKOVICH	I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
MAXINE	Do you mind?
MALKOVICH	No, I guess not. I'm an actor.

MAXINE	Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
MALKOVICH	Yes, Maxine, yes.

MALKOVICH	Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
MAXINE	Oh, Lotte...

MALKOVICH	Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
MAXINE	Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
MALKOVICH	No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.

MAXINE	Darling!
MALKOVICH	What the fuck is going on?

MALKOVICH	Come on in.
MAXINE	I can explain about the portal, darling.
MALKOVICH	Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
MAXINE	Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?

MALKOVICH	Yes. How did you know it was me?
MAXINE	Lotte called me.
MALKOVICH	Oh, so the bitch escaped.
MAXINE	Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
MALKOVICH	I'm getting better all the time.
MAXINE	I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
MALKOVICH	No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.

MAXINE	You still there, sweets?
MALKOVICH	Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
MAXINE	Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
MALKOVICH	You mean with Malkovich?
MAXINE	I'd love to see your work.
MALKOVICH	Really? Yeah. Okay.

MAXINE	That was incredible. You're brilliant!
MALKOVICH	You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
MAXINE	You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!

MAXINE	Stay in him forever?
MALKOVICH	No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
MAXINE	Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
MALKOVICH	No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
MAXINE	No one would ever have to know its not him.
MALKOVICH	Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
MAXINE	Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!

MALKOVICH	Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
MAXINE	It's okay, my sweet.

MAXINE	Vegas.
MALKOVICH	Vegas. Can you arrange that?

MAXINE	This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
MALKOVICH	I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.

MAXINE	Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
MALKOVICH	He's a selfish bastard.

MALKOVICH	They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
MAXINE	Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
MALKOVICH	Sleepy suddenly.
MAXINE	Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...

MAXINE	Bad dream, darling?
MALKOVICH	I've got to leave Malkovich.
MAXINE	You've got to be kidding.
MALKOVICH	I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.

MALKOVICH	Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
MAXINE	Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.

MAXINE	Yeah what?!
MALKOVICH	Derek Mantini!

MALKOVICH	Good-bye, Maxine.
MAXINE	Whatever.

TINY WOMAN	Captain Mertin?
MERTIN	What want ye, girl child?
TINY WOMAN	I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
MERTIN	I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
TINY WOMAN	I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
MERTIN	Aye. Speak then if ye must.
TINY WOMAN	Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?

DUDE	Hiya Allan.
ALLAN	Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.

DUDE	Sure Allan, I'll be there.
ALLAN	Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
DUDE	Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
ALLAN	Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
DUDE	Yeah, okay.

WOO	Yeah?
BLOND MAN	Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
WOO	Uh?

WOO	Fuck.
BLOND MAN	What do you think?
WOO	He looks like a fuckin' loser.

WOO	Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
BLOND MAN	And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
WOO	Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
BLOND MAN	You're not dealing with morons here.

BRANDT	Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
DUDE	It's the LeBaron.

BRANDT	Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
DUDE	Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.

BRANDT	We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
DUDE	Huh.

BRANDT	Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
DUDE	Why me, man?
BRANDT	He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
DUDE	So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
BRANDT	Well Dude, we just don't know.

BRANDT	They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
DUDE	Oh, nothin', you know.

BRANDT	Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
DUDE	Uh-huh.
BRANDT	Her life is in your hands.
DUDE	Oh, man, don't say that..
BRANDT	Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
DUDE	Shit.
BRANDT	Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.

BRANDT	This is our concern, Dude.
DUDE	No, man, nothing is fucked here--

BRANDT	That had not occurred to us, Dude.
DUDE	Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--

DUDE	Where'd she been?
BRANDT	Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
DUDE	But I guess she told Dieter.

DUDE	I know my rights.
CHIEF	You don't know shit, Lebowski.
DUDE	I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
CHIEF	What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
DUDE	Uh-huh.
CHIEF	Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
DUDE	That guy treats women like objects, man.
CHIEF	Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?

DA FINO	A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
DUDE	I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
DA FINO	Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady--
DUDE	She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
DA FINO	Hey, man, I'm not--
DUDE	Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
DA FINO	The Gundersons.
DUDE	The?  Who the fff--
DA FINO	The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.

DUDE	Jesus fucking Christ.
DA FINO	Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

DA FINO	Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
DUDE	Yeah, it sucks.
DA FINO	Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know--

WALTER	There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
DIETER	Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
WALTER	NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--

DIETER	NUSSING!
WALTER	ANTI-SEMITE!

DONNELLY	Excuse me?
DUDE	Nothing.
DONNELLY	Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.

DUDE	Can we just rent it from you?
DONNELLY	Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.

DONNELLY	Sir, please lower your voice--
DUDE	Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
DONNELLY	That is our most modestly priced receptacle.

WALTER	Yeah.
DONNELLY	We have the urn.

WALTER	What's this?
DONNELLY	That is for the urn.
WALTER	Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
DONNELLY	Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
WALTER	This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
DONNELLY	Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.

DONNELLY	They range up to three thousand.
WALTER	Yeah, but we're--

DONNY	What the fuck is he talking about?
DUDE	My rug.

DUDE	Fuckin' A.
DONNY	And this guy peed on it.

DONNY	His name is Lebowski?  That's your name, Dude!
DUDE	Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.

DONNY	What do you mean, Dude?
DUDE	Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--

DUDE	Yeah.
DONNY	I am the Walrus.

DUDE	Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
DONNY	Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?

DONNY	Sheesh.
DUDE	Walter, how--

DONNY	Where you going, Dude?
DUDE	I'm going home, Donny.
DONNY	Your phone's ringing, Dude.
DUDE	Thank you, Donny.

DUDE	Almost five!
DONNY	I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

DONNY	What tied the room together, Dude?
WALTER	Were you listening to the story, Donny?
DONNY	What--
WALTER	Were you listening to the Dude's story?
DONNY	I was bowling--
WALTER	So you have no frame of reference, Donny.  You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know--

DONNY	Yeah Walter, what's your point?
WALTER	Huh?

DONNY	He peed on the Dude's rug--
WALTER	YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

DONNY	What's a pederast, Walter?
WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny.

DONNY	If what's during league play?
WALTER	Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
DONNY	What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

DONNY	I am the Walrus.
WALTER	That fucking bitch!

WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
DONNY	What the fuck is he talking about?
WALTER	That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

DONNY	They posted the next round of the tournament--
WALTER	Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
DONNY	This Saturday.  Quintana and--
WALTER	Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.

DONNY	Burkhalter.
WALTER	I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
DONNY	It's already posted.
WALTER	WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

DONNY	How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
WALTER	I'm shomer shabbas.
DONNY	What's that, Walter?

DONNY	Oh yeah, how'd it go?
WALTER	Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--

WALTER	Kill that poor woman.
DONNY	Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
WALTER	Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?

DONNY	Who has your undies, Walter?
WALTER	Where's your car, Dude?

DONNY	And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
WALTER	Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.

WALTER	Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
DONNY	They were Nazis, Dude?
WALTER	Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
DONNY	Uh-huh.
WALTER	Are you gonna split hairs?
DONNY	No--
WALTER	Am I wrong?
DONNY	Well--

DONNY	What do you need that for, Dude?
WALTER	You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--

DONNY	Those are good burgers, Walter.
WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.

WALTER	What have you.  We'll, uh--
DONNY	We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.

DONNY	Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
WALTER	Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

DONNY	Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
WALTER	They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.

DRIVER	--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
DUDE	Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.

DUDE	Jesus, man, can you change the station?
DRIVER	Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
DUDE	I've had a--
DRIVER	I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
DUDE	--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
DRIVER	That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

YOUNG MAN	And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
DUDE	Yes, uh, very impressive.
YOUNG MAN	Please, feel free to inspect them.
DUDE	I'm not really, uh.
YOUNG MAN	Please!  Please!
DUDE	Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN	That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
DUDE	Uh-huh.
YOUNG MAN	That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
DUDE	Hey, is this him with Nancy?
YOUNG MAN	That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
DUDE	Lebowski on the right?
YOUNG MAN	Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
DUDE	He's handicapped, huh?
YOUNG MAN	Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
DUDE	Far out.
YOUNG MAN	And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
DUDE	Nancy's pretty good.
YOUNG MAN	Wonderful woman.  We were very--
DUDE	Are these.
YOUNG MAN	These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
DUDE	Different mothers, huh?
YOUNG MAN	No, they--
DUDE	I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
YOUNG MAN	They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
DUDE	I see.
YOUNG MAN	--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
DUDE	Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
YOUNG MAN	One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
DUDE	Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
YOUNG MAN	Heh-heh--
DUDE	--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
YOUNG MAN	Yes, heh--
DUDE	--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

DUDE	1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
YOUNGER COP	Color?
DUDE	Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
YOUNGER COP	And was there anything of value in the car?
DUDE	Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
YOUNGER COP	In the briefcase?
DUDE	Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
YOUNGER COP	And what do you do, sir?
DUDE	I'm unemployed.

DUDE	...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
DUDE	...Also, my rug was stolen.
YOUNGER COP	Your rug was in the car.

DUDE	No.  Here.
YOUNGER COP	Separate incidents?

YOUNGER COP	Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
DUDE	And the, uh, the briefcase?

DUDE	Ahh, not so good, man.
THE STRANGER	One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
DUDE	Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
THE STRANGER	Far from it.
DUDE	Mm.

THE STRANGER	I like your style, Dude.
DUDE	Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
THE STRANGER	Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

THE STRANGER	Take it easy, Dude.
DUDE	Yeah.  Thanks man.

THE STRANGER	Howdy do, Dude.
DUDE	Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
THE STRANGER	Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
DUDE	Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

DUDE	Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
THE STRANGER	Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
DUDE	Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude abides.

DUDE	This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
TREEHORN	What's your drink, Dude?
DUDE	White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
TREEHORN	I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
DUDE	Which one was Logjammin'?
TREEHORN	Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.

TREEHORN	People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
DUDE	On you, maybe.

TREEHORN	Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
DUDE	Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
TREEHORN	Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
DUDE	I thought you might know, man.
TREEHORN	Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
DUDE	But she hasn't run off, she's been--

TREEHORN	I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
DUDE	Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
TREEHORN	Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
DUDE	Does the Pope shit in the woods?
TREEHORN	Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
DUDE	Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.

DUDE	No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
MAN	I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

DUDE	Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
MAN	Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
DUDE	Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
MAN	Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

DUDE	Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
MAN	Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
DUDE	Huh?

MAN	Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
DUDE	Yeah man.
MAN	Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
DUDE	Jeffrey Lebowski.

DUDE	Is that what that's a picture of?
MAUDE	In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
DUDE	Oh yeah?
MAUDE	Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
DUDE	Johnson?
MAUDE	Thank you.

DUDE	Huh?
MAUDE	Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
DUDE	Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
MAUDE	Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
DUDE	Excuse me?
MAUDE	Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
DUDE	I was talking about my rug.
MAUDE	You're not interested in sex?
DUDE	You mean coitus?
MAUDE	I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
DUDE	Oh, no.
MAUDE	Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
DUDE	Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
MAUDE	Take a look at this, sir.

MAUDE	Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
DUDE	He fixes the cable?
MAUDE	Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career

DUDE	Shit yeah, the achievers.
MAUDE	Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive

DUDE	Yeah, but my-
MAUDE	I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
DUDE	Well--sure, I could do that--
MAUDE	If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
DUDE	A hundred.
MAUDE	Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
DUDE	Yeah, but what about--
MAUDE	--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.

DUDE	Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
MAUDE	Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
DUDE	That's really thoughtful but I--
MAUDE	Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.

MAUDE	Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
DUDE	No it's fine, really, uh--
MAUDE	Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
DUDE	I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
MAUDE	She most certainly was not!
DUDE	Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
MAUDE	And please don't call her my mother.
DUDE	Now I got--
MAUDE	She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
DUDE	I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
MAUDE	From who?
DUDE	The main guy, Dieter--
MAUDE	Dieter Hauff?
DUDE	Well--yeah, I guess--
MAUDE	Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
DUDE	Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
MAUDE	Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'

DUDE	Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
MAUDE	Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

DUDE	Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
MAUDE	Is he pretending to be the abductor?
DUDE	Well...yeah--
MAUDE	Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
DUDE	Well yeah...I know that.
MAUDE	So Dieter has the money?
DUDE	Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
MAUDE	Do you still have that doctor's number?
DUDE	Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--

MAUDE	Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
DUDE	Delayed after-eff--
MAUDE	I want you to see him immediately.

MAUDE	Jeffrey.
DUDE	Maude?

MAUDE	Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
DUDE	Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

DUDE	I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
MAUDE	Uh-huh.
DUDE	Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
MAUDE	Mmnun.

DUDE	And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
MAUDE	Oh?
DUDE	Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
MAUDE	Uh-huh.
DUDE	Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
MAUDE	What do you do for fun?
DUDE	Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback.

MAUDE	What happened to your house?
DUDE	Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
MAUDE	Finder's fee?
DUDE	He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
MAUDE	It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
DUDE	Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.

MAUDE	Jeffrey--
DUDE	It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
MAUDE	I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
DUDE	Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
MAUDE	No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
DUDE	But your father--he runs stuff, he--
MAUDE	We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
DUDE	But he's--
MAUDE	He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
DUDE	Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?

DUDE	Increases?
MAUDE	Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
DUDE	Well...no, of course not--
MAUDE	I want a child.
DUDE	Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
MAUDE	Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
DUDE	Huh...

DUDE	So...that doctor.
MAUDE	Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

DUDE	No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
MAUDE	What?

WALTER	This was, uh--
DUDE	Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
WALTER	This was a valued, uh.

DUDE	What's your point, Walter?
WALTER	There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

DUDE	What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
WALTER	Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--

WALTER	Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
DUDE	This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
WALTER	What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
DUDE	Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
WALTER	What the fuck are you--
DUDE	Walter, he peed on my rug--

DUDE	So who--
WALTER	Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
DUDE	No, but--
WALTER	Am I wrong!
DUDE	Yeah, but--
WALTER	Okay. That, uh.

WALTER	Donny!  Please!
DUDE	Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

WALTER	Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
DUDE	You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
WALTER	Theodore Herzel.
DUDE	Huh?
WALTER	State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
DUDE	What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
WALTER	Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
DUDE	What the fuck are you--
WALTER	I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
DUDE	You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
WALTER	What do you mean "brought it bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not buying it a fucking beer.  He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

DUDE	Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself.  Why can't she board it?
WALTER	First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
DUDE	Hey man--
WALTER	Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!

DUDE	Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
WALTER	This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?

WALTER	Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
DUDE	Hey Walter--
WALTER	Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.

DUDE	Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
WALTER	MARK IT ZERO!

DUDE	Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
WALTER	You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
DUDE	And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
WALTER	You mean--beyond pacifism?
DUDE	He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

WALTER	Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
DUDE	No, you're not wrong--
WALTER	Am I wrong!
DUDE	You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.

WALTER	Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
DUDE	Just, just take it easy, Walter.
WALTER	That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
DUDE	Well, just take 't easy, man.
WALTER	I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
DUDE	Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
WALTER	Calmer than you are.

WALTER	Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
DUDE	Huh?
WALTER	The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.

DUDE	Huh.
WALTER	When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.

WALTER	Anyway.  How much they offer you?
DUDE	Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
WALTER	Just for making the hand-off?
DUDE	Yeah.

DUDE	...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
WALTER	What if it's during a game?
DUDE	I told him if it was during league play--

DUDE	I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
WALTER	Huh?

WALTER	That...fucking...bitch!
DUDE	It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--

WALTER	Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
DUDE	I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
WALTER	Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
DUDE	Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
WALTER	Have it your way.  The point is--
DUDE	It's your roll--
WALTER	The fucking point is--
DUDE	It's your roll.

DUDE	The what?
WALTER	The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?

DUDE	What the hell is this?
WALTER	My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
DUDE	Agh--

DUDE	Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
WALTER	Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
DUDE	Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
WALTER	Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
DUDE	We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
WALTER	My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
DUDE	Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
WALTER	It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

DUDE	Oh shit.  Walter.
WALTER	What the fuck is going on there?
DUDE	They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
WALTER	Easy, Dude.
DUDE	We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
WALTER	Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

WALTER	Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
DUDE	Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
WALTER	Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

WALTER	Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
DUDE	Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
WALTER	That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.

WALTER	...Huh?
DUDE	Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
WALTER	Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong.  If there's one thing I learned in Nam--

DUDE	FUCK.
WALTER	What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
DUDE	There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
WALTER	Huh?
DUDE	We throw the money out of the moving car!

WALTER	We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
DUDE	Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
WALTER	Wooden bridge, huh?
DUDE	I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
WALTER	The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
DUDE	Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
WALTER	Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's the bridge--

DUDE	Walter!
WALTER	Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
DUDE	What the fuck?
WALTER	Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
DUDE	Uzi?

WALTER	You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
DUDE	Walter, please--

WALTER	Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
DUDE	What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski?
WALTER	Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

DUDE	Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
WALTER	What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
DUDE	No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
WALTER	That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

DUDE	Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
WALTER	I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
DUDE	Walter--

DUDE	Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
WALTER	C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--

DUDE	Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
WALTER	Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!

DUDE	That's it.  I'm out of here.
WALTER	For Christ's sake, Dude.

DUDE	But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
WALTER	Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

DUDE	Walter--
WALTER	Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
DUDE	Our car, Walter?
WALTER	And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?

DUDE	You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
WALTER	Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
DUDE	It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
WALTER	Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
DUDE	Aw, fuck it.

WALTER	That wasn't her toe.
DUDE	Whose toe was it, Walter?
WALTER	How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
DUDE	The nail polish, Walter.
WALTER	Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
DUDE	Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
WALTER	You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
DUDE	But Walter--
WALTER	I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
DUDE	They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
WALTER	Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
DUDE	What about the toe?
WALTER	FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!

WALTER	Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
DUDE	All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
WALTER	Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

DUDE	I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
WALTER	Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
DUDE	Thanks Walter.
WALTER	Not if I have anything to say about it.
DUDE	Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
WALTER	Dude--
DUDE	That makes me feel all warm inside.
WALTER	Now Dude--
DUDE	This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.

DUDE	They're nihilists.
WALTER	Huh?
DUDE	They kept saying they believe in nothing.
WALTER	Nihilists!  Jesus.

DUDE	Yeah.
WALTER	And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
DUDE	What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
WALTER	No, I'm--
DUDE	Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
WALTER	--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
DUDE	Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!

WALTER	He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
DUDE	The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
WALTER	Near the In-and-Out Burger--

DUDE	Who the fuck is that?
WALTER	Huh?
DUDE	Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
WALTER	Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
DUDE	Yeah.
WALTER	All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
DUDE	Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
WALTER	Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
DUDE	Uh-huh.
WALTER	The bulk of the series.
DUDE	Uh-huh.
WALTER	Not exactly a lightweight.
DUDE	No.
WALTER	And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
DUDE	Uh.
WALTER	Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.

DUDE	Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
WALTER	Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.

WALTER	Is this your homework, Larry?
DUDE	Look, man, did you--
WALTER	Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
DUDE	Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!

WALTER	Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
DUDE	Is the car out front yours?
WALTER	Is this your homework, Larry?
DUDE	We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?

WALTER	Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
DUDE	Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
WALTER	You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
DUDE	And the fucking money!
WALTER	And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.

DUDE	Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
WALTER	Dude?
DUDE	Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
WALTER	I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
DUDE	Huh?
WALTER	Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
DUDE	It is a fucking emergency.
WALTER	I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
DUDE	THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
WALTER	Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
DUDE	WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!

DUDE	I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
WALTER	Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
DUDE	I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
WALTER	What's your point, Dude?
DUDE	His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
WALTER	Yeah?
DUDE	Shit yeah!
WALTER	Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
DUDE	Huh?
WALTER	I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
DUDE	Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
WALTER	What the fuck are you talking about?
DUDE	You're fucking Polish Catholic--
WALTER	What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
DUDE	Yeah, and you were--
WALTER	You know this!
DUDE	And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
WALTER	Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
DUDE	This driveway.
WALTER	I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
DUDE	It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
WALTER	Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?

WALTER	AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
DUDE	You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.

WALTER	It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
DUDE	WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
WALTER	Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!

WALTER	Oh, shit.
DUDE	He can't walk, Walter!
WALTER	Yeah, I can see that, Dude.

DUDE	Walter, you fuck!
WALTER	Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
DUDE	We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

WALTER	Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
DUDE	Uh-huh.
WALTER	I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
DUDE	Yeah.
WALTER	That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.

WALTER	Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
DUDE	Hey, cool it Walter.

DUDE	Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
WALTER	AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!

WALTER	What's mine is mine.
DUDE	Come on, Walter!.

DUDE	Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
WALTER	No Dude.
DUDE	They shot Donny!

WALTER	There weren't any shots.
DUDE	Then what's...
WALTER	It's a heart attack.
DUDE	Wha.
WALTER	Call the medics, Dude.
DUDE	Wha. . . Donny--
WALTER	Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.

WALTER	Walter Sobchak.
DUDE	The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

DUDE	Well can we--
WALTER	A hundred and eighty dollars?!

WALTER	We're scattering the fucking ashes!
DUDE	Walter--
WALTER	JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!

DUDE	Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
WALTER	Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

DUDE	You make everything a fucking travesty!
WALTER	Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

DUDE	What about that shit about Vietnam!
WALTER	Dude, I'm sorry--
DUDE	What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!

WALTER	Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
DUDE	You're a fuck, Walter!

VOICE	WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
DUDE	It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.

VOICE	Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
DUDE	Shit!
VOICE	--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

DUDE	Dude here.
VOICE	Who is this?
DUDE	Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
VOICE	...Us? DUDE

VOICE	Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
DUDE	Yeah?
VOICE	Okay, listen--

DUDE	Dude here.
VOICE	Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
DUDE	Yeah.
VOICE	So no funny stuff.  Okay?
DUDE	Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.

DUDE	Dude.
VOICE	You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.

DUDE	Another Caucasian, Gary.
VOICE	Right, Dude.
DUDE	Friends like these, huh Gary.

DUDE	Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
VOICE	I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?

DUDE	Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
LEBOWSKI	You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
DUDE	Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
LEBOWSKI	I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
DUDE	So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
LEBOWSKI	Did I urinate on your rug?
DUDE	You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
LEBOWSKI	Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
DUDE	Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
LEBOWSKI	Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
DUDE	Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
LEBOWSKI	You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
DUDE	Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
LEBOWSKI	Are you employed, sir?
DUDE	Employed?
LEBOWSKI	You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
DUDE	Is this a--what day is this?
LEBOWSKI	But I do work, so if you don't mind--
DUDE	No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
LEBOWSKI	My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.

DUDE	Ah fuck it.
LEBOWSKI	Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your answer to everything!

LEBOWSKI	It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
DUDE	Dude.
LEBOWSKI	Huh?
DUDE	I don't know, sir.
LEBOWSKI	Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
DUDE	Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

DUDE	Mind if I smoke a jay?
LEBOWSKI	Bunny.

DUDE	'Scuse me?
LEBOWSKI	Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
DUDE	Fuckin' A.
LEBOWSKI	Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.

LEBOWSKI	Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
DUDE	Well we--I don't--
LEBOWSKI	They did not receive the money, you nitwit!  They  did not receive the goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS!

DUDE	C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
LEBOWSKI	WHAT?!
DUDE	I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
LEBOWSKI	What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
DUDE	I'll tell you what I'm blathering about!  I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!

DUDE	Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
LEBOWSKI	No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.

LEBOWSKI	Brandt, give him the envelope.
DUDE	Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.

LEBOWSKI	Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
DUDE	Where's the money, Lebowski?

DUDE	We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
LEBOWSKI	Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.

LEBOWSKI	Well?  Aren't you?
DUDE	Well. . . yeah.
LEBOWSKI	All right, get out.  Both of you.

LEBOWSKI	Put me down, you son of a bitch!
DUDE	Walter!

LEBOWSKI	You monsters!
DUDE	Help me put him back in his chair.

LEBOWSKI	Who the hell is he?
WALTER	I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!

WALTER	Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
LEBOWSKI	I said out.  Now.
WALTER	Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.

WALTER	This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
LEBOWSKI	Stay away from me, mister!

WALTER	Oh, shit.
LEBOWSKI	You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!

WALTER	Shit, sorry man.
LEBOWSKI	Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!

WALTER	Smokey Huh?
WALTER	Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
SMOKEY	Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
WALTER	Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
SMOKEY	Bullshit. Walter!
WALTER	This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.

SMOKEY	Yeah, but--
WALTER	Am I wrong!?
SMOKEY	Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight.

SMOKEY	I'm not--
WALTER	A world of pain.

SMOKEY	Walter--
WALTER	YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
SMOKEY	All right!  There it is!  It's fucking zero!

SMOKEY	You happy, you crazy fuck?
WALTER	This is a league game, Smokey!

TEX	Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
ADAM	Where are you, ol' buddy?
TEX	 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 

ADAM	All right -- where's the letter?
TEX	The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
ADAM	You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
TEX	You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
ADAM	What are you talking about?
TEX	First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!

ADAM	Oh, come on!
REGGIE	-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
ADAM	It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
REGGIE	Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
ADAM	Yes, but --

REGGIE	I could eat a horse.
ADAM	I think that's what you ordered.
REGGIE	Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
ADAM	How was I leading you on?
REGGIE	All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
ADAM	That's right.
REGGIE	Oh!
ADAM	What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
REGGIE	No -- I guess not.
ADAM	It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
REGGIE	What?
ADAM	Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?

ADAM	Oh, you should see your face.
REGGIE	What about it?
ADAM	It's lovely.

ADAM	What's the matter?
REGGIE	I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?

REGGIE	Adam!
ADAM	It's all right -- look.

REGGIE	You don't look so bad in this light.
ADAM	Why do you think I brought you here?
REGGIE	I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
ADAM	Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
REGGIE	Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
ADAM	How do you think I got here?

REGGIE	Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
ADAM	No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.

ADAM	When you come on, you really come on.
REGGIE	Well -- come on.

REGGIE	I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
ADAM	Relax -- you're gaining.

ADAM	That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
REGGIE	You're going to look for him -- now?
ADAM	If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
REGGIE	Adam --
ADAM	There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.

REGGIE	What is it?
ADAM	Open up.

ADAM	I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
REGGIE	Why?
ADAM	I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
REGGIE	I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
ADAM	Where's that airlines bag?
REGGIE	Lord, you're stubborn.
ADAM	I sure am. Get it.

REGGIE	But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
ADAM	Let's look anyway.
REGGIE	Lord, you're stubborn.
ADAM	I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.

ADAM	Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
REGGIE	To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
ADAM	The letter --

ADAM	It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
REGGIE	The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?

ADAM	Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
REGGIE	Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
ADAM	Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
REGGIE	I love you, Adam.
ADAM	Yes, you told me.
REGGIE	No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."

ADAM	Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
REGGIE	No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
ADAM	Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.

REGGIE	You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
ADAM	Can you remember anything at all?
REGGIE	Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
ADAM	With whom? Where?
REGGIE	I think it only said where -- but I can't --
ADAM	Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
REGGIE	That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
ADAM	Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
REGGIE	Of course there is!
ADAM	There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
REGGIE	Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.

REGGIE	as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- ÃlysÃ©es! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
ADAM	It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!

REGGIE	Now what?
ADAM	Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
REGGIE	But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
ADAM	I know, but this is all we've got left.
REGGIE	Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
ADAM	Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.

REGGIE	It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
ADAM	It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
REGGIE	Tex? You mean he's here, too?
ADAM	Look.

ADAM	Reggie -- stop!
REGGIE	Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
ADAM	I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
REGGIE	But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
ADAM	Don't be an idiot!

ADAM	Reggie -- why won't you listen?
REGGIE	I'm through listening to you!

ADAM	But I didn't kill anybody.
REGGIE	Then who did? You're the only one left.

ADAM	Reggie -- please believe me!
REGGIE	No!

REGGIE	He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
ADAM	Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!

ADAM	Reggie -- listen to me!
REGGIE	You lied to me so many times --
ADAM	Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
REGGIE	Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
ADAM	There's not a reason on earth why you should.

REGGIE	You didn't have to chase me so hard --
ADAM	Here, give it to me.

REGGIE	I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
ADAM	And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
REGGIE	The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
ADAM	What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
REGGIE	All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.

REGGIE	I said, tell me to go to the --
ADAM	I heard you, I heard you.
REGGIE	Then say it.
ADAM	Reggie -- listen to me --
REGGIE	Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
ADAM	What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --

BARTHOLOMEW	I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
REGGIE	Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
BARTHOLOMEW	Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.

BARTHOLOMEW	Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
REGGIE	Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
BARTHOLOMEW	Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?  Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.

BARTHOLOMEW	Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
REGGIE	No thanks.

BARTHOLOMEW	Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
REGGIE	I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
BARTHOLOMEW	Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
REGGIE	You mean spies and things like that?
BARTHOLOMEW	Only we call them agents.
REGGIE	We? You mean you're --?
BARTHOLOMEW	Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
REGGIE	I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
BARTHOLOMEW	I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
REGGIE	Agent.
BARTHOLOMEW	Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
REGGIE	What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
BARTHOLOMEW	Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
REGGIE	May I have a sandwich, please?

BARTHOLOMEW	To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
REGGIE	So that was it.
BARTHOLOMEW	Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
REGGIE	His -- real -- ?
BARTHOLOMEW	Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
REGGIE	Very sweet.
BARTHOLOMEW	Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
REGGIE	Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
BARTHOLOMEW	Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.

BARTHOLOMEW	Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
REGGIE	Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
BARTHOLOMEW	You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
REGGIE	Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
BARTHOLOMEW	Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
REGGIE	Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
BARTHOLOMEW	Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
REGGIE	But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
BARTHOLOMEW	Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
REGGIE	Then whose is it? His or theirs?
BARTHOLOMEW	Ours.
REGGIE	Oh, I see.
BARTHOLOMEW	And I'm afraid we want it back.
REGGIE	But I don't have it.
BARTHOLOMEW	That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
REGGIE	I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.

BARTHOLOMEW	I believe you.
REGGIE	Thanks very much.
BARTHOLOMEW	Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
REGGIE	Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
BARTHOLOMEW	Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
REGGIE	You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
BARTHOLOMEW	Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
REGGIE	But --
BARTHOLOMEW	Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?

BARTHOLOMEW	Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
REGGIE	Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
BARTHOLOMEW	We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
REGGIE	Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!

REGGIE	Why not?
BARTHOLOMEW	Because they're still here.
REGGIE	Oh.
BARTHOLOMEW	Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.

BARTHOLOMEW	I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
REGGIE	You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
BARTHOLOMEW	Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
REGGIE	Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.

REGGIE	What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
BARTHOLOMEW	Were you followed?
REGGIE	Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
BARTHOLOMEW	Agents.
REGGIE	He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
BARTHOLOMEW	Who?
REGGIE	Dyle, or whatever his name is.
BARTHOLOMEW	What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
REGGIE	He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
BARTHOLOMEW	Describe him.
REGGIE	Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
BARTHOLOMEW	No.
REGGIE	No, what?
BARTHOLOMEW	That's not Carson Dyle.
REGGIE	Carson?
BARTHOLOMEW	There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
REGGIE	You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?

REGGIE	Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
BARTHOLOMEW	I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
REGGIE	Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.

BARTHOLOMEW	I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
REGGIE	Barely, yes.
BARTHOLOMEW	In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --

BARTHOLOMEW	CafÃ©.
REGGIE	GratinÃ©e, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
BARTHOLOMEW	Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
REGGIE	Can I at least keep the onion soup?

REGGIE	Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
BARTHOLOMEW	Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
REGGIE	Steal it how?
BARTHOLOMEW	By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
REGGIE	May I have a cigarette, please?

BARTHOLOMEW	Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
REGGIE	Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
BARTHOLOMEW	Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --

BARTHOLOMEW	Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
REGGIE	But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
BARTHOLOMEW	We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
REGGIE	But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
BARTHOLOMEW	C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
REGGIE	I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
BARTHOLOMEW	I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
REGGIE	Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
BARTHOLOMEW	That's the spirit.
REGGIE	Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
BARTHOLOMEW	We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
REGGIE	Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
BARTHOLOMEW	No, Mrs. Lampert.
REGGIE	But no one actually saw him die.
BARTHOLOMEW	No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
REGGIE	Oh. Then who's this one?
BARTHOLOMEW	I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
REGGIE	Me? Why me?
BARTHOLOMEW	You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
REGGIE	Agents.

REGGIE	Yes -- ?
BARTHOLOMEW	Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
REGGIE	Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
BARTHOLOMEW	I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.

REGGIE	Are you sure there's no mistake?
BARTHOLOMEW	None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.

BARTHOLOMEW	Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
REGGIE	The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
BARTHOLOMEW	Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
REGGIE	No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
BARTHOLOMEW	The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
REGGIE	Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.

REGGIE'S VOICE	It's Charles!
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Very good.
REGGIE'S VOICE	He looks so young -- when was this taken?
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	1944. The next face, please.

REGGIE'S VOICE	It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
REGGIE'S VOICE	No.
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Next, please.

REGGIE'S VOICE	Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
REGGIE'S VOICE	No.
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	The last one, please.

REGGIE'S VOICE	That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE	Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
REGGIE'S VOICE	No, thank heaven.

REGGIE	Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
CRUIKSHANK	Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
REGGIE	You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
CRUIKSHANK	We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
REGGIE	Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
CRUIKSHANK	When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
REGGIE	Around one.
CRUIKSHANK	The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
REGGIE	Then how do I know this is your office?
CRUIKSHANK	Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
REGGIE	Bartholomew?
CRUIKSHANK	-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
REGGIE	Starting with his own.
CRUIKSHANK	Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
REGGIE	What's your first name today?
CRUIKSHANK	Brian.
REGGIE	Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
CRUIKSHANK	Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
REGGIE	Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
CRUIKSHANK	Yes.
REGGIE	But you're -- divorced?
CRUIKSHANK	No.
REGGIE	Oh.
CRUIKSHANK	My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
REGGIE	Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
CRUIKSHANK	How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
REGGIE	Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
CRUIKSHANK	I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
REGGIE	You'd lie about anything.
CRUIKSHANK	Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
REGGIE	You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
CRUIKSHANK	I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
REGGIE	You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
CRUIKSHANK	Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?

SCOBIE	If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
DYLE	You'll wreck your raincoat.

DYLE	What now?
SCOBIE	We wait -- with our mouths shut.

DYLE	How long do you intend -- ?
SCOBIE	I said with the mouth shut.

DYLE	Sorry about that.
SCOBIE	Okay -- up there.

DYLE	Do I knock or something?
SCOBIE	Open it.

SCOBIE	Keep going.
DYLE	The view had better be worth it.

DYLE	Very pretty. Now what?
SCOBIE	I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
DYLE	Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
SCOBIE	And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
DYLE	Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
SCOBIE	You're out, Dyle -- right now!

DYLE	Back where?
SCOBIE	That's the idea.

DYLE	And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
SCOBIE	Then who does?
DYLE	I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
SCOBIE	Me?
DYLE	Or you --  Or you --

SCOBIE	That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
DYLE	But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.

SCOBIE	He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
DYLE	It's all right with us --

SCOBIE	Not my room!
DYLE	What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.

DYLE	We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
SCOBIE	I'll take that.

REGGIE	Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
DYLE	Reggie?
REGGIE	It's the only name I've got. How about you?
DYLE	No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
REGGIE	Why you lied to me.
DYLE	I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
REGGIE	Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
DYLE	But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
REGGIE	Carson Dyle is dead.
DYLE	Yes, he is. He was my brother.
REGGIE	Your --
DYLE	The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
REGGIE	How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?

REGGIE	Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
DYLE	I met a man with sharp nails.
REGGIE	Scobie?
DYLE	I left him hanging around the American Express.
REGGIE	Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.

DYLE	Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
REGGIE	It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?

REGGIE	Does it hurt?
DYLE	Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?

REGGIE	Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
DYLE	Would you like to see my passport?
REGGIE	Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
DYLE	Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
REGGIE	Sure.
DYLE	Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
REGGIE	Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
DYLE	Alexander.
REGGIE	Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
DYLE	Yes, but we're divorced.
REGGIE	I thought that was Peter Joshua.
DYLE	I'm no easier to live with than he was.
REGGIE	There -- you're a new man.

DYLE	I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
REGGIE	Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
DYLE	You can't.
REGGIE	There must be some way.
DYLE	There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
REGGIE	Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
DYLE	Because he's wearing moccasins.
REGGIE	Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
DYLE	Why not a lying Blackfoot?
REGGIE	Which one are you?
DYLE	Whitefoot, of course.
REGGIE	Come here.

REGGIE	I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
DYLE	Reggie -- listen to me --
REGGIE	Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
DYLE	So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
REGGIE	I'm not fifteen.
DYLE	Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
REGGIE	Why can't you be serious?
DYLE	There, you said it.
REGGIE	Said what?
DYLE	Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
REGGIE	Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?

DYLE	Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
REGGIE	Okay.
DYLE	What are you doing?
REGGIE	Cutting it out.
DYLE	Who told you to do that?
REGGIE	You did.
DYLE	But I'm not through complaining yet.
REGGIE	Oh. 

DYLE	Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
REGGIE	I think I love you, Alex --

DYLE	The phone's ringing --
REGGIE	Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.

REGGIE	They've got Jean-Louis!
DYLE	That sounds like their problem.
REGGIE	I'll be right there.

REGGIE	What day is it?
DYLE	Tuesday.
REGGIE	Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
DYLE	I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.

DYLE	Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
REGGIE	I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.

DYLE	Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
REGGIE	Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
DYLE	He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
REGGIE	Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.

DYLE	Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
REGGIE	No.

REGGIE	Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
DYLE	Maybe.
REGGIE	Or Tex?
DYLE	Maybe.
REGGIE	You're a big help. Can I have one of those?

REGGIE	I think Tex did it.
DYLE	Why?
REGGIE	Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
DYLE	Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
REGGIE	What's so illogical about that?
DYLE	A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
REGGIE	Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
DYLE	Who?
REGGIE	Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
DYLE	What -- like Scobie?
REGGIE	No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?

DYLE	I'd love some, thanks.
REGGIE	I'm sorry.

DYLE	No sense messing up the streets.
REGGIE	Alex --
DYLE	Hm?
REGGIE	I'm scared.
DYLE	Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
REGGIE	No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.

DYLE	Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
REGGIE	What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
DYLE	Yes, I know.
REGGIE	First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
DYLE	What? Assassinate somebody?
REGGIE	No --

REGGIE	Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
DYLE	Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.

REGGIE	Got you.
DYLE	Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
REGGIE	The shower's in there.

DYLE	Reggie -- open the door.
REGGIE	This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
DYLE	Then I suggest you call one of them.
REGGIE	I dare you.

REGGIE	What are you doing?
DYLE	Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.

DYLE	I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
REGGIE	Shut the door!
DYLE	I don't think I know that one.

DYLE	The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
REGGIE	How often do you go through this little ritual?

DYLE	Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
REGGIE	I don't believe it.

DYLE	Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
REGGIE	I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
DYLE	Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
REGGIE	How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
DYLE	No -- not yet.
REGGIE	But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
DYLE	Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?

DYLE	What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
REGGIE	It's a start, anyway.
DYLE	I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
REGGIE	Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.

DYLE	I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
REGGIE	I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
DYLE	Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
REGGIE	Fiction or non-fiction?
DYLE	Why don't you shut up!
REGGIE	Well!
DYLE	Are you going to listen?
REGGIE	Go on.
DYLE	After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
REGGIE	I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
DYLE	It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
REGGIE	What do you mean?
DYLE	When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
REGGIE	You mean, you're a thief?
DYLE	Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
REGGIE	I don't believe it.
DYLE	Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
REGGIE	But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
DYLE	Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
REGGIE	Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
DYLE	The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
REGGIE	No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --

REGGIE	Monsieur FÃ©lix -- ?
FÃLIX	I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
REGGIE	Yes.
FÃLIX	The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.

FÃLIX	Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
REGGIE	I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
FÃLIX	I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
REGGIE	How much is it worth?
FÃLIX	The money is unimportant.
REGGIE	I'm afraid it is important.
FÃLIX	In your money, perhaps $65,000.
REGGIE	Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
FÃLIX	It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
REGGIE	What's its value today?
FÃLIX	In human life? In greed? In suffering?
REGGIE	In money.
FÃLIX	Forty-five thousand.
REGGIE	Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
FÃLIX	A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
REGGIE	And the last one?
FÃLIX	The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
REGGIE	You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur FÃ©lix -- are they for sale now?
FÃLIX	Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
REGGIE	Here's ten.

REGGIE	Please keep it.
FÃLIX	I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.

REGGIE	I'm -- I'm sorry.
FÃLIX	No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.

GIDEON	That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
TEX	And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --

GIDEON	I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
TEX	That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.

GIDEON	What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
TEX	And if it is?
GIDEON	Why bother him?

TEX	You sure nuthin's missin'?
GIDEON	No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.

TEX	There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
GIDEON	Not unless we're blind.
TEX	You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
GIDEON	Meaning what?
TEX	You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
GIDEON	You know I'd tell you if I had it.
TEX	Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
GIDEON	Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.

GIDEON	What do you mean, no?
TEX	The kid said --

GIDEON	Mrs. Lampert --
REGGIE	What do you want?
GIDEON	Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
REGGIE	Tell me what?
GIDEON	It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
REGGIE	I don't know anything.
GIDEON	Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
REGGIE	Leave me alone -- !
GIDEON	Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
REGGIE	Stop it!

GIDEON	I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
REGGIE	But his mother --
GIDEON	She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.

REGGIE	Yes.
GRANDPIERRE	I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?

GRANDPIERRE	You loved him?
REGGIE	I'm very cold.

GRANDPIERRE	We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
REGGIE	Leave?
GRANDPIERRE	Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
REGGIE	I'm very confused.

GRANDPIERRE	He was American?
REGGIE	Swiss.
GRANDPIERRE	Oh. Swiss. His profession?
REGGIE	He didn't have one.
GRANDPIERRE	He was a wealthy man?
REGGIE	I don't know. I suppose so.
GRANDPIERRE	About how wealthy would you say?
REGGIE	I don't know.
GRANDPIERRE	Where did he keep his money?
REGGIE	I don't know.
GRANDPIERRE	Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
REGGIE	I don't know.
GRANDPIERRE	C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
REGGIE	I know.  I'm sorry.
GRANDPIERRE	It is all right.

GRANDPIERRE	Is it all right?
REGGIE	I wish you wouldn't.

GRANDPIERRE	One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- ElysÃ©es"  Why there?
REGGIE	I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
GRANDPIERRE	Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
REGGIE	A letter? May I see it?

REGGIE	My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed.  Not very much, is it?
GRANDPIERRE	We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
REGGIE	Did you?
GRANDPIERRE	Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.

GRANDPIERRE	If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
REGGIE	Is that all? Can I go now?
GRANDPIERRE	One more question. Is this your husband's passport?

REGGIE	Of course it is.
GRANDPIERRE	And this?

REGGIE	I don't understand.
GRANDPIERRE	And this? And this?

REGGIE	I was, too.
GRANDPIERRE	In Mr. Dyle's room?
REGGIE	No -- in my room.
GRANDPIERRE	It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?

JEAN-LOUIS	Oh, la.
REGGIE	Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!

JEAN-LOUIS	Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
REGGIE	-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
JEAN-LOUIS	Okay.

JEAN-LOUIS	Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
REGGIE	What should we give him?

REGGIE	Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
JEAN-LOUIS	I know. I would bury it in the garden.
REGGIE	Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
JEAN-LOUIS	Oh.  Neither do I.  VoilÃ !
REGGIE	VoilÃ  what?
JEAN-LOUIS	Up there! I would put it up there!

REGGIE	I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
JEAN-LOUIS	I found it! I found it!
REGGIE	If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
JEAN-LOUIS	We won! We won!

JEAN-LOUIS	Up there! It is up there!
REGGIE	No, Jean-Louis.

REGGIE	Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
JEAN-LOUIS	A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
REGGIE	Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?

JEAN-LOUIS	But he is gone.
REGGIE	I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur FÃ©lix lives?
JEAN-LOUIS	No -- but I will ask.

PETER	Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
REGGIE	It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
PETER	He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
REGGIE	Why, do you think we're going to?
PETER	I don't know -- how would I know?
REGGIE	I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
PETER	Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
REGGIE	Quitter.
PETER	How's that?
REGGIE	You give up awfully easy, don't you?

PETER	Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
REGGIE	I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
PETER	Sorry. Which view would you like?
REGGIE	The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
PETER	Peter Joshua.
REGGIE	I'm Regina Lampert.
PETER	Is there a Mr. Lampert?
REGGIE	Yes.
PETER	Good for you.
REGGIE	No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
PETER	Please, not on my account.
REGGIE	No, you see, I don't really love him.
PETER	Well, you're honest, anyway.
REGGIE	Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
PETER	I'm not sure I --
REGGIE	Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
PETER	Oh. I guess.
REGGIE	Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
PETER	Yes, but we're divorced.
REGGIE	That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
PETER	Is your husband with you?
REGGIE	Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
PETER	Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
REGGIE	Now you're angry.
PETER	No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
REGGIE	Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
PETER	Shakespeare never said that.
REGGIE	How do you know?
PETER	It's terrible -- you just made it up.
REGGIE	Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
PETER	Are you in the book?
REGGIE	Charles is.
PETER	Is there only one Charles Lampert?

REGGIE	What are you doing here?
PETER	I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
REGGIE	How did you find out?
PETER	It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
REGGIE	Thank you.

PETER	I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
REGGIE	Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.

PETER	Where did everything go?
REGGIE	Charles sold it all -- at auction.
PETER	Do you know what you're going to do?
REGGIE	Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
PETER	Doing what?
REGGIE	I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
PETER	Instant divorce you mean?
REGGIE	Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
PETER	Come on. You can't stay here.
REGGIE	I don't know where to go.
PETER	We'll find you a hotel.
REGGIE	Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
PETER	Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?

REGGIE	Hallo, Peter.
PETER	You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
REGGIE	I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.

PETER	What's going on?
REGGIE	Don't you understand French?
PETER	I'm still having trouble with English.
REGGIE	The man and the woman are married --

PETER	Of course? I thought he was dead.
REGGIE	He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?

PETER	Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
REGGIE	Starting tonight?

PETER	What was all that?
REGGIE	Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
PETER	You mean you and me?
REGGIE	No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!

PETER	En garde.
REGGIE	Lay on, MacDuff.

PETER	What are you doing in here?
REGGIE	Having a nervous breakdown.

PETER	You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
REGGIE	I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
PETER	I don't think I follow you.
REGGIE	He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
PETER	Who said?
REGGIE	That's what I'm not supposed to say.
PETER	Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
REGGIE	Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
PETER	I wasn't --
REGGIE	Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.

PETER	You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
REGGIE	How do you shave in there?
PETER	What was it?
REGGIE	What was what?
PETER	What your husband was mixed up in.
REGGIE	Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
PETER	Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?

PETER	We're here.
REGGIE	Where?
PETER	On the street where you live.
REGGIE	How about once more around the park?

REGGIE	Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
PETER	How would you like a spanking?
REGGIE	How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
PETER	Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
REGGIE	Do you know what's wrong with you?
PETER	What?
REGGIE	Nothing. Good night.
PETER	Good night.

REGGIE	Peter -- are you all right?
PETER	I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
REGGIE	Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.

PETER	Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
REGGIE	Be careful, Peter.
PETER	You took the words right out of my mouth.

PETER	There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
REGGIE	There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
PETER	What?
REGGIE	A quarter of a million dollars.

PETER	Go on.
REGGIE	That's all.
PETER	No, it isn't -- where's the money?
REGGIE	I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
PETER	So they think he left it with you.
REGGIE	But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.

PETER	No, they won't -- I won't let them.
REGGIE	Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
PETER	Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --

REGGIE	I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
PETER	That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
REGGIE	Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
PETER	Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
REGGIE	Do you tell lies?

PETER	Who is it?
REGGIE	The man you had the fight with.

REGGIE	Yes -- that's right.
PETER	What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?

PETER	What'd he say?
REGGIE	He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
PETER	I wouldn't take that too seriously.
REGGIE	I believe what he said.
PETER	They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
REGGIE	How do you know what they're doing?
PETER	I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
REGGIE	What are you talking about?
PETER	You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
REGGIE	Words can hurt very much.
PETER	Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
REGGIE	Don't put yourself out.
PETER	Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
REGGIE	Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
PETER	Good night.

TEX	Miz Lampert, ma'am...
REGGIE	Yes?
TEX	Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
REGGIE	I don't understa--

TEX	Howdy, Miz Lampert.
REGGIE	Wha -- what do you want?

TEX	You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
REGGIE	No -- no, I'm don't.
TEX	Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!

REGGIE	Stop that!
TEX	Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

TEX	It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
REGGIE	Please stop -- please!
TEX	You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?

REGGIE	Can you give me one good reason why I should?
TEX	Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?

REGGIE	Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
SYLVIE	Va jouer, mon ange.

REGGIE	Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
SYLVIE	Ãa alors! From Charles?
REGGIE	He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
SYLVIE	But what?
REGGIE	I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.

SYLVIE	But why do you want a divorce?
REGGIE	Because I don't love him.
SYLVIE	But that is no reason to get a divorce!

SYLVIE	With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
REGGIE	I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,

SYLVIE	He knows everything.
REGGIE	Don't you want me to stay?

REGGIE	It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
SYLVIE	Didn't Charles have any friends?
REGGIE	Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
SYLVIE	At least he knows how to behave at funerals.

SYLVIE	Have you no idea who could have done it?
REGGIE	Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.

SYLVIE	Do you know him?
REGGIE	I've never seen him before.
SYLVIE	He must have known Charles pretty well.
REGGIE	How can you tell?
SYLVIE	He's allergic to him.

SYLVIE	Who is it from?
REGGIE	The American Embassy.

SYLVIE	What is it about?
REGGIE	I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.

REGGIE	I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
SYLVIE	Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
REGGIE	Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
SYLVIE	Oh la vache!

REGGIE	Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
SYLVIE	Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
REGGIE	What's he up to?
SYLVIE	He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
REGGIE	I'm glad. But what's all this?
SYLVIE	The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
REGGIE	Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
SYLVIE	What's the matter, chÃ©rie?
REGGIE	Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
SYLVIE	What?
REGGIE	A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!

REGGIE	I don't see him.
SYLVIE	We will separate -- you look over there.

SCOBIE	We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
TEX	Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
SCOBIE	Yeah? What's that?
TEX	He took care of Charlie for us.

TEX	Shoot no, not after all these years.
SCOBIE	Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!

TEX	Howdy, Miz Lampert.
SCOBIE	Who invited you?

TEX	This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
SCOBIE	We want that money -- now!

ALFREDO	You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
SALVATORE	...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!

ALFREDO	'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
SALVATORE	So I can have these? 
ALFREDO	Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!

ALFREDO	What are you doing here?
SALVATORE	I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 

ALFREDO	Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
SALVATORE	Fifty lire... 
ALFREDO	What you find tonight on the floor between the seats? 

SALVATORE	Alfredo, did you know my father?
ALFREDO	Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.

ALFREDO	'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
SALVATORE	But you don't have any kids!!!
ALFREDO	All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them! 

SALVATORE	I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
ALFREDO	Toto, come here.

ALFREDO	Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
SALVATORE	Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
ALFREDO	Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
SALVATORE	Then why don't you change jobs? 
ALFREDO	Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
SALVATORE	No...
ALFREDO	Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
SALVATORE	But don't you like anything about what you do? 
ALFREDO	With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
SALVATORE	Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 

ALFREDO	You understand which side the gelatin's on?
SALVATORE	It tastes wonderful!

SALVATORE	Will they really find work in Germany?
ALFREDO	Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
SALVATORE	Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.

ALFREDO	It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
SALVATORE	Too bad!

ALFREDO	Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
SALVATORE	Come in, Alfredo.

ALFREDO	How's school?
SALVATORE	OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
ALFREDO	Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
SALVATORE	Why? What do you mean?
ALFREDO	Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?

SALVATORE	Yes. I want proof.
ALFREDO	For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.

SALVATORE	What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
ALFREDO	Progress! It always arrives too late!

ALFREDO	Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
SALVATORE	That's right, Modern Times.
ALFREDO	I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
SALVATORE	Yes. 
ALFREDO	What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
SALVATORE	It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.

ALFREDO	Now what can you see?
SALVATORE	Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
ALFREDO	Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.

SALVATORE	Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
ALFREDO	What's she like? What's she like?...

ALFREDO	Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
SALVATORE	What you say is wonderful! But sad...
ALFREDO	They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.

ALFREDO	I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
SALVATORE	But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
ALFREDO	Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.

SALVATORE	Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
ALFREDO	Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
SALVATORE	You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
ALFREDO	I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
SALVATORE	No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...

ALFREDO	Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
SALVATORE	Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
ALFREDO	Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.

ALFREDO	You weren't expecting me?
SALVATORE	No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
ALFREDO	You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.

ALFREDO	But where'd you go, Toto?!!
SALVATORE	I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
ALFREDO	No, nobody came. 

ALFREDO	You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
SALVATORE	They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
ALFREDO	Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.

ALFREDO	Did you ever see her again? 
SALVATORE	No. And nobody knows where she is.
ALFREDO	It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?

SALVATORE	Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
SALVATORE	Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
ALFREDO	Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
SALVATORE	Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
ALFREDO	No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.

SALVATORE	Thanks for all you've done for me.
ALFREDO	Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 

ALFREDO	Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
PRIEST	Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.

PRIEST	What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
ALFREDO	Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...

PRIEST	But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
ALFREDO	I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...

PRIEST	You understand now? You see it clearly?
ALFREDO	Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
PRIEST	And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!

SALVATORE	My name's Salvatore...And yours?
ELENA	Elena. My name's Elena.

SALVATORE	Hi, Elena!
ELENA	Hi. Why are you running?
SALVATORE	No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
ELENA	Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
SALVATORE	Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!

ELENA	Father, I have sinned...
SALVATORE	We'll talk about that later.
ELENA	But...who...
SALVATORE	Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.

SALVATORE	I don't care. I'll wait.
ELENA	For what?
SALVATORE	For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...

ELENA	You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
SALVATORE	That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...

SALVATORE	Elena!...But when...
ELENA	I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...

ELENA	So what'd they say?
SALVATORE	The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...

ELENA	No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
SALVATORE	Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
ELENA	He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
SALVATORE	Who?
ELENA	The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.

SALVATORE	You're still beautiful...
ELENA	Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
SALVATORE	Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
ELENA	Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.

SALVATORE	I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
ELENA	One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
SALVATORE	No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
ELENA	All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...

ELENA	My husband...you know him.
SALVATORE	Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
ELENA	Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.

SALVATORE	But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
ELENA	Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?

ELENA	It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
SALVATORE	Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
ELENA	I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs... 

SALVATORE	Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
ELENA	He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.

SALVATORE	But I never saw that note!  I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation... 
ELENA	What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.

ELENA	No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
SALVATORE	I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.

SALVATORE	I don't remember him any moreÂMa, where's Russia?
MARIA	It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.

MARIA	I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
SALVATORE	No...
MARIA	Then where's the money?
SALVATORE	Somebody stole it.

SALVATORE	Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
MARIA	It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!

MARIA	Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
SALVATORE	They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!

MARIA	See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
SALVATORE	No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
MARIA	You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...

SALVATORE	No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
MARIA	And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
SALVATORE	You never used to do that!

SALVATORE	Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
SPACCAFICO	So what's that got to do with it?
SALVATORE	The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
SPACCAFICO	What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!

SPACCAFICO	Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
SALVATORE	OK...

SALVATORE	How long's it been shut?
SPACCAFICO	Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...

SALVATORE	But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
SPACCAFICO	Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...

ACTIVIST	Are you sure?
CUSTOMER	Am I sure?
ACTIVIST	Are you sure?
CUSTOMER	Am I sure about what?
ACTIVIST	Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
CUSTOMER	Are you serious?
ACTIVIST	How long have you been smoking?
CUSTOMER	What is this, a poll?

ACTIVIST	I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
CUSTOMER	What the hell is that?
ACTIVIST	That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
CUSTOMER	You're shittin' me.
ACTIVIST	You think I'm shitting you...

CUSTOMER	What's this?
ACTIVIST	It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
CUSTOMER	Unnhh!
ACTIVIST	He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.

CUSTOMER	Well, if it's already too late...
ACTIVIST	It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
CUSTOMER	It's not the same.
ACTIVIST	It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.

CUSTOMER	Jesus!
ACTIVIST	It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
CUSTOMER	I'll just take the gum.

CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
ACTIVIST	This? How long have you been smoking?

DANTE	Thanks. Have a good one.
ACTIVIST	Do you mind if I drink this here?
DANTE	Sure. Go ahead.

DANTE	Beats me.
ACTIVIST	How long have you been a smoker?

DANTE	Excuse me, but...
ACTIVIST	This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?

DANTE	Fifty-five.
ACTIVIST	You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.

DANTE	Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
ACTIVIST	No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
DANTE	If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
ACTIVIST	Okay. I'm sorry about that.

DANTE	Hey, now wait a sec...
ACTIVIST	Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
DANTE	I think you'd better leave now.
ACTIVIST	You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
DANTE	You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
ACTIVIST	You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.

DANTE	That's it, everybody out.
ACTIVIST	We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
DANTE	Yeah, but not in here.
ACTIVIST	What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
DANTE	Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
ACTIVIST	The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!

CAITLIN	Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
RANDAL	Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
CAITLIN	You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
RANDAL	I take it she likes the guy.
CAITLIN	You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
RANDAL	Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
CAITLIN	She said not to come home until graduation.
RANDAL	Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
CAITLIN	What can I say? He does weird things to me.
RANDAL	Can I watch?
CAITLIN	You can hold me down.
RANDAL	Can I join in?
CAITLIN	You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
RANDAL	Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
CAITLIN	A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
RANDAL	Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
CAITLIN	Dick.
RANDAL	Exactly.
CAITLIN	So where is he?
RANDAL	He went home to change for the big date.
CAITLIN	God, isn't he great?
RANDAL	No, this is great.
CAITLIN	Can I use the bathroom?
RANDAL	There's no light back there.
CAITLIN	Why aren't there any lights?
RANDAL	Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
CAITLIN	You're kidding.
RANDAL	Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
CAITLIN	Such a sordid state of affair.
RANDAL	And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
CAITLIN	I'll try to manage.

RANDAL	Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
CAITLIN	You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
RANDAL	Territoriality. He was mine first.
CAITLIN	Awww. That was so cute.

RANDAL	Am I missing something here?
CAITLIN	I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
RANDAL	He was?
CAITLIN	It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
RANDAL	You dog! I didn't see you go back there.

RANDAL	I was here the whole time.
CAITLIN	You two better quit it.

RANDAL	Nobody! I swear!
CAITLIN	I feel nauseous.

RANDAL	Why?
CAITLIN	No, don't!

DANTE	When did you get back?
CAITLIN	Just now.
DANTE	My God. I haven't seen you since... 
CAITLIN	Dante. You've got a customer.

CAITLIN	I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
DANTE	Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
CAITLIN	Train. It took eight hours.
DANTE	I can't believe you're here.

CAITLIN	You're just going to lock the store like that?
DANTE	I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
CAITLIN	You saw it?
DANTE	Very dramatic, I thought.
CAITLIN	It's not what you think.
DANTE	What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
CAITLIN	I'm not pregnant.
DANTE	Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
CAITLIN	I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
DANTE	You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
CAITLIN	I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
DANTE	And you said yes?
CAITLIN	Well... kind of, sort of?
DANTE	Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
CAITLIN	I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
DANTE	How do you know that?
CAITLIN	Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
DANTE	So you're really getting married?
CAITLIN	No.
DANTE	No, you're not really getting married?
CAITLIN	The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
DANTE	How like her.
CAITLIN	Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
DANTE	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
CAITLIN	Was I right?
DANTE	Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
CAITLIN	I love a macho faÃ§ade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
DANTE	And you came here to what? To comfort me?
CAITLIN	The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
DANTE	But you were.
CAITLIN	No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
DANTE	Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
CAITLIN	I'm giving him his ring back.
DANTE	What?
CAITLIN	I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
DANTE	Sang? His name is a past tense?
CAITLIN	Stop it. He's a nice guy.
DANTE	If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
CAITLIN	I just told you.
DANTE	There's more, isn't there?
CAITLIN	Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
DANTE	Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
CAITLIN	You don't have anything to do with it.
DANTE	You lie.
CAITLIN	Look how full of yourself you are.
DANTE	I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
CAITLIN	If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
DANTE	Jesus, you're caustic.
CAITLIN	I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
DANTE	So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
CAITLIN	Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
DANTE	But can we date?
CAITLIN	I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
DANTE	We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
CAITLIN	You're serious. You want to date again.
DANTE	I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
CAITLIN	It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
DANTE	Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
CAITLIN	You work in a market, all right.
DANTE	Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
CAITLIN	The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
DANTE	So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
CAITLIN	I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
DANTE	Let me take you out tonight.
CAITLIN	You mean, on a date?
DANTE	Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
CAITLIN	The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
DANTE	You have a better suggestion?
CAITLIN	How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
DANTE	I hear that's a rather popular date.
CAITLIN	Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
DANTE	What about Sing?
CAITLIN	Sang.
DANTE	Sang.
CAITLIN	He's not invited.
DANTE	He's your fiancÃ©.
CAITLIN	I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.
DANTE	So what are you saying?
CAITLIN	You're such an asshole.
DANTE	I'm just kidding.
CAITLIN	I can already tell this isn't going to work.
DANTE	I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
CAITLIN	Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
DANTE	He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
CAITLIN	You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
DANTE	Who doesn't?
CAITLIN	Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
DANTE	What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
CAITLIN	I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.

CAITLIN	How'd you get here so fast?
DANTE	I left like an hour ago.
CAITLIN	Do you always talk weird after you violate women?

CAITLIN	Promise me it'll always be like that.
DANTE	Like what?
CAITLIN	When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
DANTE	Um... okay.

CAITLIN	And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
DANTE	It wasn't me.
CAITLIN	Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
DANTE	Was it you?

DANTE	I'm serious.
CAITLIN	We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
DANTE	No.

CAITLIN	Stop this. This isn't funny.
DANTE	I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
CAITLIN	This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
DANTE	I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?

DANTE	Are you sure somebody was back there?
CAITLIN	I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!

CAITLIN	I can't believe this! I feel faint...
DANTE	Call the police.

DANTE	There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!
CAITLIN	Oh God...

DANTE	I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
CORONER	What time was this?
DANTE	Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?

CORONER	Wait a second? Who was working here today?
DANTE	Just me.
CORONER	I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
DANTE	We did.
CORONER	Then who operated the store?
DANTE	Nobody. It was closed.
CORONER	With this guy locked in?
DANTE	Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.

DANTE	Was he alive when... Caitlin...
CORONER	No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.

DANTE	Well he asked me for it!
CORONER	I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.

DANTE	What about Caitlin?
CORONER	Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
DANTE	She thought it was me.

CUSTOMER	Are you open?
DANTE	Yeah.
CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes.

CUSTOMER	This is the last time I come to this place.
DANTE	Excuse me?
CUSTOMER	Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
DANTE	We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
CUSTOMER	Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.

DANTE	If you can just wait a few more minutes.
CUSTOMER	Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!

CUSTOMER	What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
DANTE	In a second!
CUSTOMER	Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
DANTE	I can pass!
CUSTOMER	How 'bout covering point!? You suck!

DANTE	Who are you to make assessments?
CUSTOMER	I'll assess all I want!

DANTE	Like you're better!
CUSTOMER	I can whip your ass.

DANTE	That's easy to say from over here.
CUSTOMER	Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.

CUSTOMER	Are you open?
DANTE	Yes.

DANTE	My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
CUSTOMER	Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase.  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
DANTE	They certainly do. Two fifty-five.

CUSTOMER	I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
DANTE	Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
CUSTOMER	Well, he missed!
DANTE	I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
CUSTOMER	This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!

CUSTOMER	Excuse me, do you have...
DANTE	To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?

CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
DANTE	So I'm told.

RANDAL	All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
CUSTOMER	This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
RANDAL	Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?

CUSTOMER	Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
RANDAL	Lenin's Tomb.

RANDAL	I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
CUSTOMER	Are you open?

CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
RANDAL	Annoying Customer.

CUSTOMER	Pack of cigarettes.
RANDAL	What's your point?

CUSTOMER	I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
RANDAL	So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?

CUSTOMER	Cute cat. What's his name.
RANDAL	Peptic ulcer.

CUSTOMER	You open?
RANDAL	Yeah.

RANDAL	What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
CUSTOMER	Oooh! Navy Seals!

SANFORD	Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
DANTE	If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
SANFORD	So?
DANTE	So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
SANFORD	What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
DANTE	I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
SANFORD	What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.

DANTE	All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
SANFORD	Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.

DANTE	You only brought one ball?!
SANFORD	I thought Redding had like three balls!

SANFORD	Shit!
DANTE	We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!

DANTE	You're late.
RANDAL	What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
DANTE	The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
RANDAL	Why are the shutters closed?
DANTE	Someone jammed gum in the locks.
RANDAL	Bunch of savages in this town.
DANTE	That's what I said.
RANDAL	Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.

RANDAL	What time do you have to stay till?
DANTE	He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
RANDAL	What smells like shoe polish?
DANTE	Go open the sore.

RANDAL	Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
DANTE	Shocking abuse of authority.
RANDAL	I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
DANTE	Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
RANDAL	I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.

RANDAL	Want something to drink? I'm buying.
DANTE	No, thanks.
RANDAL	Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
DANTE	Why?
RANDAL	I wanted to use your car.

DANTE	You don't want to know.
RANDAL	You called Caitlin again?
DANTE	She called me.
RANDAL	Did you tell Veronica?
DANTE	One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
RANDAL	What do you two fight about?
DANTE	I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
RANDAL	I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
DANTE	You win.
RANDAL	I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
DANTE	Seven months.
RANDAL	Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
DANTE	Five years.
RANDAL	Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
DANTE	Eight and a half.
RANDAL	Eight and a half?
DANTE	Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
RANDAL	That's cheating?
DANTE	In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
RANDAL	She called you Brad?
DANTE	She called me Brad.
RANDAL	That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
DANTE	I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
RANDAL	What do you mean?
DANTE	She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
RANDAL	Oh, my God.
DANTE	Great story, isn't it?
RANDAL	That girl was vile to you.
DANTE	Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
RANDAL	Your mother.
DANTE	Allan Harris.
RANDAL	Chess team Allan Harris?!
DANTE	The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
RANDAL	That's frightening.
DANTE	It takes different strokes to move the world.
RANDAL	In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
DANTE	Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
RANDAL	Oh yeah.
DANTE	I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
RANDAL	You think things would be any different now?
DANTE	They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
RANDAL	Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
DANTE	I'm talking to myself here.
RANDAL	No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
DANTE	...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
RANDAL	What about Veronica?
DANTE	I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
RANDAL	Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
DANTE	I think it's safe to say yes.
RANDAL	Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
DANTE	All four?
RANDAL	You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancÃ©.

DANTE	Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
RANDAL	You know what I just watched?
DANTE	Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
RANDAL	Return of the Jedi.
DANTE	Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
RANDAL	Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
DANTE	Empire.
RANDAL	Blasphemy.
DANTE	Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
RANDAL	There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.

DANTE	What's that?
RANDAL	All right, Vader's boss...
DANTE	The Emperor.
RANDAL	Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
DANTE	How do you mean?
RANDAL	Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
DANTE	I guess.
RANDAL	Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
DANTE	Yeah.
RANDAL	Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
DANTE	It would stand to reason, yes.
RANDAL	Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
DANTE	More or less.
RANDAL	The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
DANTE	I think they were Catholics.

RANDAL	You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
DANTE	There's more?
RANDAL	So they build another Death Star, right?
DANTE	Yeah.
RANDAL	Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
DANTE	Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
RANDAL	And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
DANTE	Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
RANDAL	Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
DANTE	And you figured it out?
RANDAL	Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
DANTE	Basically.
RANDAL	So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
DANTE	And the second time around...?
RANDAL	The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
DANTE	So?
RANDAL	A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
DANTE	Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
RANDAL	Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
DANTE	All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
RANDAL	All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.

RANDAL	You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
DANTE	Wait.
RANDAL	She's in here?
DANTE	This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.

RANDAL	What's he looking for?
DANTE	He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
RANDAL	Perfect dozen.
DANTE	Each egg has to be perfect.
RANDAL	The quest isn't going well?
DANTE	Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.

RANDAL	Why doesn't he just mix and match?
DANTE	I told him that and he yelled at me.

RANDAL	What did he say?
DANTE	He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
RANDAL	It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
DANTE	I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.

DANTE	Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
RANDAL	You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
DANTE	What's a jizz-mopper?
RANDAL	He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
DANTE	Nudie booth?
RANDAL	Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
DANTE	I guess not.

RANDAL	Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
DANTE	What kind of show?
RANDAL	Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
DANTE	Can we talk about this later?
RANDAL	The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.

DANTE	Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
RANDAL	Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
DANTE	I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
RANDAL	You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
DANTE	What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
RANDAL	Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
DANTE	There aren't.
RANDAL	How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
DANTE	It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
RANDAL	Let's hear it.
DANTE	The milkmaids.
RANDAL	The milkmaids?

DANTE	The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
RANDAL	You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
DANTE	Which ones?
RANDAL	All of them.

DANTE	No.
RANDAL	Why not?
DANTE	Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
RANDAL	Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
DANTE	Veronica!

RANDAL	Thirty-seven!
DANTE	Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.

DANTE	Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
RANDAL	Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
DANTE	The best Burtless movie ever made.

RANDAL	Vermont?
DANTE	Can you believe this?!
RANDAL	He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
DANTE	Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
RANDAL	So, what-you're stuck here all day?
DANTE	FUCK!
RANDAL	Why'd you apologize?
DANTE	What?
RANDAL	I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
DANTE	I know.
RANDAL	That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
DANTE	I don't back down.
RANDAL	Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
DANTE	You know what pisses me off the most?
RANDAL	The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
DANTE	I'm going to miss the game.
RANDAL	Because you buckled.
DANTE	Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
RANDAL	Don't yell at me, pal.
DANTE	Sorry.
RANDAL	See? There you go again.
DANTE	I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
RANDAL	At least we're stuck here together.
DANTE	You've got a customer.

DANTE	Pull my laces tighter.
RANDAL	I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
DANTE	I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
RANDAL	No argument here. Insubordination rules.
DANTE	I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.

RANDAL	He's blunt, but he's got a point.
DANTE	At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.

RANDAL	Design major.
DANTE	Can we not talk about this?

RANDAL	Are you gonna lock the store?
DANTE	I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
RANDAL	Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
DANTE	We're not playing in the street.
RANDAL	Then where're we gonna play?

RANDAL	Helluva game!
DANTE	One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
RANDAL	Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
DANTE	Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
RANDAL	Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
DANTE	Gatorade.

RANDAL	What happened to all the Gatorade?
DANTE	Exactly. They drank it all.
RANDAL	After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
DANTE	It's not like we're gonna sell out.

RANDAL	You know what Sanford told me? 
DANTE	I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
RANDAL	Julie Dwyer died.
DANTE	Yeah, right.
RANDAL	No, I'm serious.

DANTE	Oh, my god.
RANDAL	Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
DANTE	How? When?
RANDAL	Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
DANTE	Jesus.
RANDAL	She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
DANTE	I haven't seen her in almost two years.
RANDAL	Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
DANTE	Number six.
RANDAL	You've had sex with a dead person.
DANTE	I'm gonna go to her wake.
RANDAL	No, you're not.
DANTE	Why not?
RANDAL	It's today.
DANTE	What!?
RANDAL	Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
DANTE	Shit. What about tomorrow?
RANDAL	One night only. She's buried in the morning.
DANTE	You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
RANDAL	Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
DANTE	You hardly knew her!
RANDAL	True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
DANTE	Stop it. This is beneath even you.
RANDAL	I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
DANTE	You hate people.
RANDAL	But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
DANTE	Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
RANDAL	If you go, I go.
DANTE	She meant nothing to you!
RANDAL	She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
DANTE	I'm not taking you to this funeral.
RANDAL	I'm going with you.
DANTE	I can't close the store.
RANDAL	You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
DANTE	Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.

RANDAL	You were saying?
DANTE	Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.

RANDAL	She was pretty young, hunhh?
DANTE	Twenty-two; same as us.
RANDAL	An embolism in a pool.
DANTE	An embarrassing way to die.
RANDAL	That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
DANTE	How'd he die?
RANDAL	Broke his neck.
DANTE	That's embarrassing?
RANDAL	He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.

DANTE	Shut the hell up.
RANDAL	Bible truth.
DANTE	Stop it.
RANDAL	I swear.
DANTE	Oh, my god.
RANDAL	Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
DANTE	No!
RANDAL	Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
DANTE	Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
RANDAL	No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
DANTE	Who found him?
RANDAL	My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
DANTE	His dick was in his mouth?
RANDAL	Balls resting on his lips.
DANTE	He made it, hunhh?
RANDAL	Yeah, but at what a price.

DANTE	I could never reach.
RANDAL	Reach what?
DANTE	You know.
RANDAL	What, your dick?
DANTE	Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
RANDAL	I never tried it.

DANTE	I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
RANDAL	Listen to you.
DANTE	I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
RANDAL	Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?

DANTE	I can't fucking believe you!!
RANDAL	I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
DANTE	You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
RANDAL	I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
DANTE	Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
RANDAL	So the casket fell over! Big deal!
DANTE	Her fucking body fell out!
RANDAL	So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
DANTE	Just... go! Go open the video store.

RANDAL	Let me borrow your car.
DANTE	I don't want to talk to you.
RANDAL	Fine. Just lend me your car.
DANTE	Why should I loan you my car?
RANDAL	I want to rent a movie.
DANTE	You want to rent a movie.

RANDAL	What's that for?
DANTE	You work in a video store!

DANTE	Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
RANDAL	Let me borrow your car.
DANTE	May I be blunt with you?
RANDAL	If you must.
DANTE	We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
RANDAL	I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
DANTE	There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.

RANDAL	You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
DANTE	It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?

RANDAL	So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
DANTE	What?
RANDAL	The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
DANTE	Exactly.

DANTE	That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
RANDAL	Not yet. 

DANTE	What the fuck did you do that for?
RANDAL	Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
DANTE	Jesus!
RANDAL	And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
DANTE	What?
RANDAL	If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
DANTE	You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
RANDAL	I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
DANTE	Please, get the hell out of here.
RANDAL	I know I'm your hero.

RANDAL	Get to work.
DANTE	What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
RANDAL	Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
DANTE	And this is what you rented?
RANDAL	I like to expand my horizons.
DANTE	I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
RANDAL	No way!
DANTE	Five hundred dollars.
RANDAL	You're bullshitting.

RANDAL	I didn't think they even enforced this.
DANTE	Living proof.
RANDAL	I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
DANTE	I don't; you did.
RANDAL	Really?
DANTE	Little girl. Maybe five years old?
RANDAL	Holy shit. That girl?
DANTE	As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
RANDAL	Then how come you got the fine?
DANTE	Because I'm here.
RANDAL	You're lying.
DANTE	I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
RANDAL	Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
DANTE	Because I'm happy.
RANDAL	You're happy?
DANTE	I'm happy.
RANDAL	You're happy to get a fine?
DANTE	No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
RANDAL	Now I know you're lying.
DANTE	I'm not. She just left.
RANDAL	What did she say?
DANTE	She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
RANDAL	You're kidding.
DANTE	I'm not.
RANDAL	Wow. You've had quite an evening.
DANTE	She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
RANDAL	I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
DANTE	Watch the store while I go home and change.
RANDAL	What happened to title dictates behavior?
DANTE	This is my way of spitting water at life.
RANDAL	Hey, what about Veronica?
DANTE	No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
RANDAL	You're a snake.
DANTE	In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
RANDAL	You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
DANTE	I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
RANDAL	All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
DANTE	I'll read the book.

DANTE	Who eats cock?
RANDAL	Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
DANTE	There's no lights back there.
RANDAL	I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
DANTE	I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
RANDAL	Fuck you.

RANDAL	Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
DANTE	Could be.

RANDAL	You just fucked a total stranger?
DANTE	Shut the fuck up!

RANDAL	She said she did all the work.
DANTE	WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?

RANDAL	Around three or something.
DANTE	What time did we go to the funeral?
RANDAL	I think four.

RANDAL	What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
DANTE	This life.
RANDAL	This life?
DANTE	Why do I have this life?
RANDAL	Have some chips; you'll feel better.
DANTE	I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
RANDAL	Thirty-seven.
DANTE	My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.

RANDAL	That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
DANTE	I was born.

RANDAL	You should shit or get off the pot.
DANTE	I should shit or get off the pot.
RANDAL	Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
DANTE	What are you talking about?
RANDAL	I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
DANTE	Fuck you.
RANDAL	It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
DANTE	What responsibility?
RANDAL	All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
DANTE	As if it's that easy.
RANDAL	It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
DANTE	Leave me alone.
RANDAL	You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
DANTE	Oh, like your life's any better?
RANDAL	I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
DANTE	Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
RANDAL	It's the same thing with Veronica.
DANTE	Leave her out of this.
RANDAL	You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
DANTE	Leave me alone.
RANDAL	If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
DANTE	...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
RANDAL	Am I right or what?
DANTE	You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
RANDAL	What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
DANTE	Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
RANDAL	Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
DANTE	What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
RANDAL	Make them change.
DANTE	I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
RANDAL	Who're you kidding? You can so.
DANTE	Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
RANDAL	So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
DANTE	My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
RANDAL	Lovely story.
DANTE	Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.

RANDAL	How's your eye?
DANTE	The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
RANDAL	It's hard to swallow.

RANDAL	You didn't have to choke me.
DANTE	Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
RANDAL	I thought I was doing you a favor.
DANTE	Thanks.
RANDAL	You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
DANTE	Jesus.

RANDAL	You still didn't have to choke me.
DANTE	Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
RANDAL	Why do you say that?
DANTE	Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
RANDAL	No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
DANTE	What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
RANDAL	How do you figure?
DANTE	What time did you get to work today?
RANDAL	Like ten after.
DANTE	You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
RANDAL	To talk to you.
DANTE	Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
RANDAL	It's not like I'm miles away.
DANTE	Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
RANDAL	Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
DANTE	You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
RANDAL	Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "I'm not even supposed to be here today."  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?

RANDAL	I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
DANTE	You need a ride?
RANDAL	Got one. Just pulled up.

DANTE	Do you work tomorrow?
RANDAL	Same time. What about you?
DANTE	I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
RANDAL	You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
DANTE	I'll call you. Let you know.
RANDAL	All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
DANTE	No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
RANDAL	Helluva day.
DANTE	To say the least.
RANDAL	Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
DANTE	Get the fuck outta here already.
RANDAL	I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

HEATHER	Are you open?
DANTE	Yes.
HEATHER	Just the paper.
DANTE	Thirty-fire.

HEATHER	I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
DANTE	I know I can bench more than that!

HEATHER	He's got those love handles.
DANTE	I don't have love handles.

DANTE	Do I know you?
HEATHER	You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
DANTE	Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
HEATHER	I'm her sister.
DANTE	You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
HEATHER	Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.

DANTE	You know him?
HEATHER	Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.

HEATHER	I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
DANTE	THE GLADES MOTEL?

HEATHER	I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
DANTE	Jesus Christ, what next?

TRAINER	Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
DANTE	Excuse me?
TRAINER	I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
DANTE	I didn't strain. I sighed.
TRAINER	I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
DANTE	I don't think so.
TRAINER	Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
DANTE	They are not.
TRAINER	Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
DANTE	What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
TRAINER	No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.

DANTE	I am not.
TRAINER	How much can you bench?
DANTE	I don't know.

DANTE	Oh for God's sake!
TRAINER	See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.

TRAINER	Did you say Caitlin Bree?
DANTE	Yeah.
TRAINER	Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
DANTE	Yeah?
TRAINER	And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
DANTE	How do you know that?
TRAINER	Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
DANTE	No, she's getting married.
TRAINER	To you?

DANTE	What?
TRAINER	While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.

DANTE	Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
TRAINER	All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
DANTE	I... I don't believe this...

DANTE	What? When? When did all this shit happen?
TRAINER	Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.

DANTE	But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
TRAINER	Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

DANTE	Are there any balls down there?!
JAY	'Bout the biggest pair you ever seen! NYNNE!!

DANTE	Go open the video store.
JAY	Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
DANTE	How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
JAY	I'm not dealing.

JAY	Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
DANTE	Done poisoning the youth for the day?
JAY	Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
DANTE	One seventy-nine.
JAY	Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
DANTE	A half hour.
JAY	We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
DANTE	I should start.
JAY	Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
DANTE	With you? I don't think so.
JAY	Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
DANTE	Nothing personal.

JAY	I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
DANTE	How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
JAY	Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
DANTE	It's not my store.
JAY	And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
DANTE	The difference is you exploit a weakness.
JAY	What's that mean?
DANTE	You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
JAY	All right. How much is Pepsi here?
DANTE	A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
JAY	At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
DANTE	So.
JAY	So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
DANTE	I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
JAY	Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
DANTE	He died in the bathroom.
JAY	That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
DANTE	I don't know. I wasn't watching.
JAY	Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
DANTE	Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
JAY	You used to go out with her?
DANTE	We were going to start again, I think.
JAY	Don't you already have a girlfriend?
DANTE	Veronica.
JAY	Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
DANTE	Lasagne.
JAY	And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
DANTE	Maybe.
JAY	I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
DANTE	I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
JAY	Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
DANTE	She's my girlfriend.
JAY	I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
DANTE	Meaning?
JAY	I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
DANTE	I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	You calling me a liar?
DANTE	No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
DANTE	Actually, that's his night job.
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
DANTE	If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER	Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.

OLD MAN	Be careful.
DANTE	I'm trying.
OLD MAN	You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
DANTE	So I'm told.
OLD MAN	I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.

DANTE	And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
OLD MAN	No, he got hit by a bus.
DANTE	Oh... Can I help you?
OLD MAN	Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
DANTE	Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
OLD MAN	I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
DANTE	Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
OLD MAN	Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
DANTE	The white kind.
OLD MAN	I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
DANTE	Actually, it is kind of rough.
OLD MAN	Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
DANTE	Yeah, but...
OLD MAN	Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
DANTE	Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
OLD MAN	Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.

OLD MAN	Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
DANTE	Jesus... go ahead.
OLD MAN	Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.

DANTE	You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
OLD MAN	Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
DANTE	I said go ahead.
OLD MAN	No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.

DANTE	The porno mags?
OLD MAN	Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
DANTE	Here. Now leave me alone.
OLD MAN	Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.

VERONICA	All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
DANTE	Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
VERONICA	At least they weren't lit.
DANTE	I hate this fucking place.
VERONICA	Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
DANTE	Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
VERONICA	All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
DANTE	I'm not even supposed to be here today!
VERONICA	I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
DANTE	The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
VERONICA	Don't you have a hockey game at two?
DANTE	Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
VERONICA	Why did you agree to come in then?
DANTE	I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
VERONICA	Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
DANTE	Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
VERONICA	You're kidding.
DANTE	Bunch of savages in this town.
VERONICA	You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
DANTE	I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
VERONICA	What were you doing up so late?
DANTE	Hunhh? Nothing.
VERONICA	What were you doing?
DANTE	Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
VERONICA	Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
DANTE	Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.

DANTE	What? What is that?
VERONICA	She called you, didn't she?
DANTE	Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.

VERONICA	How much money did you leave up there?
DANTE	Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
VERONICA	You're trusting.
DANTE	Why do you say that?
VERONICA	How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
DANTE	Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
VERONICA	Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
DANTE	I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
VERONICA	Do you think anyone can see us down here?
DANTE	Why? You wanna have sex or something?
VERONICA	Ooh! Can we?!
DANTE	Really?
VERONICA	I was kidding.
DANTE	Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
VERONICA	Typically male point of view.
DANTE	How do you figure?
VERONICA	You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
DANTE	Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
VERONICA	Be there?
DANTE	Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
VERONICA	How flattering.
DANTE	Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
VERONICA	Oh, you think so?
DANTE	A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
VERONICA	And I actually date you?
DANTE	Something wrong?
VERONICA	I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
DANTE	I touched a nerve.
VERONICA	I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
DANTE	It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
VERONICA	You were making a generalization about "broads!"
DANTE	These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
VERONICA	How many?
DANTE	How many what?
VERONICA	How many girls have you slept with?
DANTE	How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
VERONICA	We might have; I don't remember. How many?
DANTE	Including you?
VERONICA	It better be up to and including me.
DANTE	Twelve.
VERONICA	You've slept with twelve different girls?
DANTE	Including you; yes.

DANTE	What the hell was that for?
VERONICA	You're a pig.
DANTE	Why'd you hit me?
VERONICA	Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
DANTE	Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
VERONICA	Three.
DANTE	Three?
VERONICA	Three including you.
DANTE	You've only had sex with three different people?
VERONICA	I'm not the pig you are.
DANTE	Who?
VERONICA	You!
DANTE	No; who were the three, besides me?
VERONICA	John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
DANTE	Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
VERONICA	I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
DANTE	Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
VERONICA	Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
DANTE	They put up the least amount of struggle.
VERONICA	After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
DANTE	All right. Name it.
VERONICA	I want you to come with me on Monday.
DANTE	Where?
VERONICA	To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
DANTE	Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
VERONICA	It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
DANTE	Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.

DANTE	Shit! Why are we getting up?
VERONICA	Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.

DANTE	Why do you call him that?
VERONICA	Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
DANTE	What do you mean?
VERONICA	After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
DANTE	He requested this?
VERONICA	He gets off on it.
DANTE	Sylvan can be talked into anything.
VERONICA	Why do you say that?
DANTE	Like you said-she snowballed him.
VERONICA	Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
DANTE	Yeah, right.
VERONICA	I'm serious...

DANTE	You sucked that guy's dick?
VERONICA	Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
DANTE	But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
VERONICA	That's because I never had sex with him!
DANTE	You sucked his dick!
VERONICA	We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
DANTE	Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
VERONICA	Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
DANTE	Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
VERONICA	I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
DANTE	I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
VERONICA	Please calm down.
DANTE	How many?
VERONICA	Dante...
DANTE	How many dicks have you sucked?!
VERONICA	Let it go...
DANTE	HOW MANY?
VERONICA	All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
DANTE	This is different. This is important. How many?!

DANTE	Well...?
VERONICA	Something like thirty-six.
DANTE	WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
VERONICA	Lower your voice!
DANTE	What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
VERONICA	Um. Thirty-seven.
DANTE	I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
VERONICA	I'm going to class.
DANTE	Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!

DANTE	Hey! Where are you going?!
VERONICA	Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
DANTE	No, but you sucked enough dick!
VERONICA	Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
DANTE	A few?
VERONICA	...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
DANTE	Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
VERONICA	Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
DANTE	I feel sick.
VERONICA	I love you. Don't feel sick.
DANTE	Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.

VERONICA	I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
DANTE	Thirty-seven. I just can't...
VERONICA	Goodbye, Dante.

DANTE	He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
VERONICA	Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
DANTE	What is it?
VERONICA	Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
DANTE	Really?  You're the best.
VERONICA	I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.

VERONICA	You had to tell him.
DANTE	I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
VERONICA	What did he say?
DANTE	At least he wasn't thirty-six.
VERONICA	And that made you feel better?
DANTE	And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
VERONICA	The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
DANTE	...it isn't there. Yes.
VERONICA	Thank you for being rational.
DANTE	Thank you for the lasagne.
VERONICA	You couldn't get these shutters open?
DANTE	I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
VERONICA	Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
DANTE	What time do you get finished?
VERONICA	Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
DANTE	Sure.
VERONICA	Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.

DANTE	What the fuck did you do that for?
VERONICA	If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
DANTE	What're you talking about?
VERONICA	You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
DANTE	It was only a few times...
VERONICA	And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
DANTE	A couple...?
VERONICA	I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
DANTE	Would you let me explain...
VERONICA	Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
DANTE	Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...

VERONICA	You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
DANTE	I don't want Caitlin...
VERONICA	You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
DANTE	I don't want to go back with her...
VERONICA	Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
DANTE	Randal...?
VERONICA	And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
DANTE	Veronica, I love you...
VERONICA	Fuck you.

DANTE	You hold the counter and I'll pull.
MAN	Usually I just turn the can upside down.
DANTE	Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
MAN	They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
DANTE	I think it's coming now...

MAN	Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
DANTE	I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
MAN	It stings a little.
DANTE	A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.

SUITED MAN	You open?
DANTE	Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
SUITED MAN	Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
DANTE	What?

SUITED MAN	Were you working here at about four o'clock?
DANTE	I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?

DANTE	I'm not out of shape!
SUITED MAN	Can I have your name please?
DANTE	Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?

SUITED MAN	Here you go.
DANTE	What's this?
SUITED MAN	A fine, for five hundred dollars.
DANTE	WHAT?

DANTE	What are you talking about?
SUITED MAN	According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
DANTE	I didn't do that!
SUITED MAN	You said you were here all day?
DANTE	Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
SUITED MAN	An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
DANTE	But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!

DANTE	I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
SUITED MAN	The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.

JAY	Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
GIRL 1	Scumbag. What are you doing?
JAY	Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
GIRL 1	He's your cousin?
JAY	Check this out, he's from Russia.
GIRL 1	No way.
JAY	I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?

GIRL 1	He only speaks Russian?
JAY	He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.

GIRL 1	No way!
JAY	Swear.  Olaf, metal!

GIRL 1	What did he say?
JAY	I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.

GIRL 1	That doesn't sound metal.
JAY	You gotta hear him sing.  Olaf, "Berserker!"

GIRL 1	Did he say "making fuck?"
JAY	Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 

GIRL 2	What part of Russia?
JAY	I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?

GIRL 2	Is he staying here?
JAY	He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.

GIRL 2	He really wants to play metal?
JAY	He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.

JAY	Come on, man, "Berserker!"
GIRL 2	Does he sing in English or Russian?
JAY	English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.

TRAINER	Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
HEATHER	I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
TRAINER	He is.

TRAINER	I think the lady called it.
HEATHER	My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
TRAINER	I do about three-fifty, four.
HEATHER	No way!
TRAINER	Feel that.
HEATHER	That's tight. Solid.
TRAINER	Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.

TRAINER	It's probably from being around all this food every day.
HEATHER	Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.

HEATHER	You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
TRAINER	Because he's out of shape.

HEATHER	To an Asian design major.
TRAINER	Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.

HEATHER	Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
TRAINER	Yeah!

TRAINER	Really?
HEATHER	Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...

TRAINER	Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
HEATHER	She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.

TRAINER	To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
HEATHER	That's sick, Dante.

HEATHER	Sure. How about the beach?
TRAINER	I like the way you think.

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
RANDAL	I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Well, how about these two movies? 

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
RANDAL	No, I wasn't.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	I don't think your manager would appreciate...
RANDAL	I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	I beg your pardon!
RANDAL	Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
RANDAL	I hope it feels good.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	You hope what feels good?
RANDAL	I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
RANDAL	You'll be missed.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER	Screw you!

JAY	That's the price, my brother.
JOHN	Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
JAY	For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
JOHN	How long you gonna be here?
JAY	Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
JOHN	You're gonna be at John K's party?
JAY	My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
JOHN	Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
JAY	The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
JOHN	Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
JAY	I'll see you there.

VERONICA	And... he told you all of this?
RANDAL	Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
VERONICA	I... I don't know what to say.
RANDAL	Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
VERONICA	I'm not sad.
RANDAL	You're not?
VERONICA	No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
RANDAL	He didn't ask me to...
VERONICA	After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
RANDAL	Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
VERONICA	I'm going to have a word with that asshole.

V.A. CUSTOMER	The guy ain't here yet.
RANDAL	You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
V.A. CUSTOMER	I know. I've been here since eleven.
RANDAL	Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
V.A. CUSTOMER	I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
RANDAL	Which one?
V.A. CUSTOMER	Dental School.
RANDAL	You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
V.A. CUSTOMER	I have first dibs.
RANDAL	Says who?
V.A. CUSTOMER	Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
RANDAL	Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
V.A. CUSTOMER	Like hell you are!
RANDAL	I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
V.A. CUSTOMER	Twenty bucks?
RANDAL	Twenty bucks.
V.A. CUSTOMER	All right, asshole, you're on.

VERONICA	Willam!
WILLAM	Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
VERONICA	No, I'm just visiting my man.  Dante, this is Willam Black.  This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

VERONICA	No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
WILLAM	Do you still talk to Sylvan?
VERONICA	I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
WILLAM	That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
VERONICA	I will. Take it easy.
WILLAM	Bye. 
VERONICA	Bye  That was Snowball.

BELA	Greetings.  I am the Count.
HOST	Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.

HOST	Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
BELA	It is my home.
HOST	Oh, tract housing, huh?  I guess I shouldn't complain about my duplex in Burbank.  What a dump. Some places have a Murphy bed, this place has a Murphy <u>shower</u>.  I still don't know where to hang the towels!

BELA	Uh, beg to differ.
HOST	Beg to differ?!  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
BELA	Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...

CRISWELL	Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
BELA	It's a pleasure...
CRISWELL	Ah, cheer up!   Don't lose heart over what happened tonight.  I predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!

CRISWELL	Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
BELA	No.  I never drink -- wine.

CRISWELL	So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
BELA	Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
CRISWELL	I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
BELA	No.
CRISWELL	YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!

BELA	Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
CRISWELL	I predict we're lost.

ED	Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
BELA	I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
ED	No.  I don't work here.
BELA	Huh?

BELA	Who are you?  What do you want?
ED	I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
BELA	Ha!

ED	Why were you buying a coffin?
BELA	Because I'm planning on dying soon.
ED	Really?
BELA	Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andÃ³truck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.

ED	You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
BELA	Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
ED	I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
BELA	Thank you.
ED	I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
BELA	I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.

BELA	Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
ED	Don't you bave a car?
BELA	I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.

ED	Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
BELA	I have no next picture.
ED	Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
BELA	Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.

ED	But you're a big star!
BELA	No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.

BELA	They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
ED	The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
BELA	They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
ED	The <u>women</u>?
BELA	The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
ED	I never thought of that.
BELA	Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."

BELA	Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
ED	Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
BELA	Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.

ED	Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
BELA	I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.

BELA	Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
ED	Hey Bela, how do you do that?
BELA	You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.

BELA	I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
ED	Do you want me to get it for you?
BELA	No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.

ED	Are you sure this is okay?
BELA	Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.

BELA	Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
ED	Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!

BELA	Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
ED	Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
BELA	Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.

ED	Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
BELA	I don't understand.
ED	Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
BELA	Ah, so I pull the strings!
ED	Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!

ED	Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
BELA	I am always on time.
ED	Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
BELA	Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
ED	Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.

ED	You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
BELA	Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --

ED	Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
BELA	BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!

ED	How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
BELA	But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
ED	Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
BELA	Who do I play?
ED	Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
BELA	Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...

ED	Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
BELA	That's good.  I could use the money.
ED	But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
BELA	Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
ED	Of course!

BELA	Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
ED	So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
BELA	We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
ED	They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...

ED	Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
BELA	Dracula?
ED	No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
BELA	Ah!  This is very exciting.
ED	I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!

ED	Bela, what happened?!
BELA	I didn't feel well...
ED	Let me take you to the hospital.
BELA	No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...

ED	Should I call a doctor?
BELA	Nah.  This happens all the time...

ED	Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
BELA	Goulash.
ED	I don't know how to make goulash.

ED	What's in the needle?
BELA	Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
ED	Don't worry.  I'll do something.

BELA	Greetings.  I am the Count.
ED	Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure. Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
BELA	It is my home.
ED	Oh, tract housing, huh?  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
BELA	Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --

ED	No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
BELA	Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!

ED	Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
BELA	I never said I could ad-lib...
ED	Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.

ED	Goodbye!  Goodbye!
BELA	So how'd we do?
ED	We didn't make a dime.

ED	Bela, are you ready?
BELA	Mmph?  Where am I?
ED	You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.

ED	You'll be sitting on the right.
BELA	I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
ED	Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.

BELA	Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
ED	That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
BELA	Dear, you're lovely.  "Strap her to the table."

ED	Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
BELA	Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.

ED	What is this place?
BELA	This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.

ED	Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
BELA	Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
ED	But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
BELA	Eddie, you screwed up.
ED	Yeah, I did.

BELA	In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
ED	Really?
BELA	It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
ED	So why didn't you do it?
BELA	I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
ED	But maybe not.
BELA	Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.

BELA	Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
ED	Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.

BELA	Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
ED	You'll be fighting with the octopus.
BELA	Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
ED	This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
BELA	Oh, for Christ's sake.

BELA	Goddamn, it's cold!
ED	Once you're in it, it warms up.
BELA	Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.

BELA	Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
ED	Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.

BELA	Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
ED	Huh?
BELA	After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me.

ED	Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
BELA	Don't let me slow you down.
ED	Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!

ED	Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
BELA	That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
ED	No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
BELA	Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
ED	I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.

BELA	Eddie, this is quite a scene.
ED	I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.

BELA	Why are you here??
ED	Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
BELA	Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
ED	Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?

ED	What are you doing?
BELA	I was thinking about killing myself.
ED	Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
BELA	Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
ED	Don't you have any savings?
BELA	I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.

ED	Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
BELA	It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
ED	Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
BELA	Formaldehyde.

ED	Don't worry.
BELA	I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
ED	Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.

ED	What happened?!
BELA	Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
ED	Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
BELA	Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!

ED	I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
BELA	Really?  I don't feel so great.
ED	No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...

BELA	Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
ED	Soon, Bela... Soon.

BELA	So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
ED	No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
BELA	Oh.  So what is the scene about?
ED	Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.

BELA	Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
ED	That's great.  Let's do a take.

ED	And, cut...
BELA	Eddie, how was I?
ED	Perfect.

BELA	Sorry...
ED	Has anyone ever been to Downey?

BELA	Last night was quite a romp.
ED	Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
BELA	I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
ED	Yeah, she's really somethin'.
BELA	I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.

BELA	Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
ED	I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
BELA	No problem.  I know it by heart...

BUNNY	So guess where I'm going next weekend?
ED	I don't know.  Where?
BUNNY	Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
ED	I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
BUNNY	WRONG!  I'm getting my first series of hormone shots!  And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!

ED	Jesus!  Are you serious?
BUNNY	Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!

ED	I've never seen anything like him!
BUNNY	And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
ED	Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?

ED	This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
BUNNY	You mean a Tesla coil?
ED	If you say so.

ED	PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
CAMERAMAN BILL	Rolling.

ED	And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
CAMERAMAN BILL	Don't you want a second take, for protection?
ED	What's to protect?  It was perfect!

ED	Um, okay... roll camera
CAMERAMAN BILL	Rolling.
ED	Sound!

CAMERAMAN BILL	Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
ED	What do you mean?
CAMERAMAN BILL	I mean I can't see the difference. I'm color-blind.  But I like the dark gray one.

CAMERAMAN BILL	Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
ED	No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.

CONRAD	I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
ED	This is the big moment...!

CONRAD	You really think so?
ED	Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.

ED	What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
CONRAD	Nothin'!  I told him he was great.

ED	What do you think you're doin'?!
CONRAD	These shoes are itchy.
ED	You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.

ED	You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
CONRAD	This is kind of a stream--
ED	NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!

ED	Wow.
CRISWELL	And who may you be?
ED	Edward Wood, Sir.
CRISWELL	Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
ED	H-how'd you know?!
CRISWELL	I'm Criswell.  I know all.

ED	Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
CRISWELL	I guessed.
ED	I don't understand.
CRISWELL	I made it up.  It's horseshit!

CRISWELL	There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
ED	It's that easy?
CRISWELL	Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.

CRISWELL	Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
ED	Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
CRISWELL	My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.

CRISWELL	Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
ED	I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.

CRISWELL	Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
ED	Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.

ED	Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
DOCTOR	Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
ED	Will he be okay?
DOCTOR	We'll do our best.

DOCTOR	We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
ED	Isn't he?
DOCTOR	No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
ED	Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.

ED	Dolores, give me your shoes.
DOLORES	What?
ED	The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!

ED	Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
DOLORES	Ed, it was only one review.
ED	Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
DOLORES	Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
ED	I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...

DOLORES	Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
ED	Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.

ED	Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
DOLORES	You got the job?!!
ED	Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
DOLORES	Better than not getting a job?
ED	Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
DOLORES	Who?  Robert Taylor?!
ED	No!  A horror movie star!
DOLORES	Boris Karloff!?
ED	Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
DOLORES	You met Basil Rathbone!
ED	Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
DOLORES	I thought he was dead.

ED	No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
DOLORES	Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
ED	It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
DOLORES	So did you get his autograph?

DOLORES	Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
ED	Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...

DOLORES	How long have you been doing this?
ED	Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
DOLORES	Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
ED	This is my way of telling you --
DOLORES	What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?

DOLORES	And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
ED	Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
DOLORES	Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.

ED	It's a damn good role.
DOLORES	<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
ED	It takes me comfortable.
DOLORES	Oh, just like in the script!

DOLORES	How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
ED	Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
DOLORES	Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
ED	Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.

DOLORES	Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
ED	Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.

ED	From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
DOLORES	I don't know.  It's so much money...
ED	Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
DOLORES	But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
ED	But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!

ED	Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
DOLORES	Toss us out on our ass.
ED	Exactly.

ED	I'm no good.
DOLORES	Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
ED	Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
DOLORES	That's ridiculous.

ED	All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
DOLORES	Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.

DOLORES	Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
ED	Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
DOLORES	Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
ED	That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
DOLORES	Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
ED	Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
DOLORES	All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!

ED	It was the only way I could get the movie made!
DOLORES	Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
ED	I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
DOLORES	I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
ED	But there's plenty of other parts.
DOLORES	Like <u>what</u>?!
ED	The secretary.  Or the file clerk.

ED	Goddamn landlord.
DOLORES	I told you this was gonna happen.
ED	Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
DOLORES	That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
ED	Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
DOLORES	That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
ED	<u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!

DOLORES	You're a fuckin' mess.
ED	So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
DOLORES	I'm going to my mother's.
ED	Does she have room for me?

ED	Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
DOLORES	Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
ED	That's right...
DOLORES	I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?

ED	That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
DOLORES	Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
ED	None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
DOLORES	Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
ED	Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.

DOLORES	Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
ED	Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
DOLORES	But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
ED	Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.

ED	Dolores, wait!
DOLORES	Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
ED	Did you really mean those things you said..?

DOLORES	I'm tired of living on the fringe.
ED	But you used to say --
DOLORES	Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.

LORETTA	Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
ED	I understand you just moved here?
LORETTA	Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.

ED	So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
LORETTA	Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
ED	For this one, we need $60,000.
LORETTA	That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.

ED	Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
LORETTA	Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
ED	Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
LORETTA	Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.

LORETTA	Eddie, which dress do you like better?
ED	I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?

ED	Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
LORETTA	Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
ED	Yeah.  Exactly!

ED	I kinda need it now.
LORETTA	What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
ED	Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
LORETTA	What other sixty-thousand?
ED	The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
LORETTA	You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.

RUDE BOSS	Hey big shot, get off your ass.  They need a potted palm over in the Carl Laemmle Building.
ED	Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.

RUDE BOSS	He's a <u>bum</u>.
ED	No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
RUDE BOSS	Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
ED	That's not true --
RUDE BOSS	He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
ED	Well, uh, if I could I would...

MR. FELDMAN	Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
ED	It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
MR. FELDMAN	Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?

MR. FELDMAN	So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
ED	Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
MR. FELDMAN	Really?!  Well good for you.
ED	I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
MR. FELDMAN	Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
ED	Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
MR. FELDMAN	I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?

ED	Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
MR. FELDMAN	Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
ED	<u>Dr. Acula</u>!

MR. FELDMAN	Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
ED	But Bela Lugosi's in it!
MR. FELDMAN	Lugosi's washed-up.  What else you got?

ED	Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
MR. FELDMAN	Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.

REYNOLDS	Mr. Wood?!
ED	Hruphh...?
REYNOLDS	Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?

ED	Yeah...?
REYNOLDS	Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
ED	I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.

REYNOLDS	Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
ED	You could say that --
REYNOLDS	<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
ED	Raising money is tough.
REYNOLDS	Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...

ED	Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
REYNOLDS	Would that work?
ED	Absolutely!  You see this script..?

ED	Graverobbers From Outer Space! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
REYNOLDS	Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
ED	From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.

REYNOLDS	I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
ED	It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
REYNOLDS	Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
ED	Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
REYNOLDS	<u>Lugosi</u>??!  Didn't be pass on?

ED	Yes, but I've got the last footage he ever shot!
REYNOLDS	Just, it doesn't look like very much.
ED	It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"

REYNOLDS	What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
ED	Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.

ED	And PERFECT.  CUT!
REYNOLDS	Perfect?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
ED	I like to think so.
REYNOLDS	That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
ED	People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
REYNOLDS	Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???

ED	Mr. Reynolds!
REYNOLDS	Yes?
ED	We are gonna finish this film <u>just</u> <u>the way I want it</u>!  Because you can't compromise an artist's vision!

ED	Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
TOR	Da pleasure be mine.

TOR	Could we moovf to table?
ED	Oh, of course!

ED	So, Mr. Johnson --
TOR	Tor!
ED	Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
TOR	Mm, not good-lookink enough.
ED	I think you're quite handsome.
TOR	No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.

ED	Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
TOR	But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
ED	Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.

ED	So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
TOR	I like.  When do movie shoot?
ED	Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.

TOR	Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
ED	Really?  Was the third act too intense?
TOR	No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
ED	But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
TOR	Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.

ED	Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
TOR	But Greta say --

ED	Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
TOR	Okey-dokey.

TOR	Hey!  You're not eatink.
ED	Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
TOR	The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!

ED	I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
TOR	Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.

ED	Tor, I should be getting home.
TOR	Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.

TOR	My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
ED	But I thought me and Dolores had something.
TOR	Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.

TOR	My eyes are killink me.
ED	Don't worry.  We're almost there.

TOR	What is happening?
ED	We're escaping!

ED	Excuse me, Sir...?
ORSON WELLES	Yes?
ED	Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
ORSON WELLES	My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
ED	Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
ORSON WELLES	Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.

ED	I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
ORSON WELLES	It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
ED	Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
ORSON WELLES	Ugh, I hate when that happens.
ED	And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
ORSON WELLES	Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!

ED	Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
ORSON WELLES	It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?

GEORGIE	Can I help you?
ED	Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
GEORGIE	Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
ED	So you're not gonna make the movie?
GEORGIE	No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preÃ³sold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.

ED	Is there a script?
GEORGIE	Fuck no!  But there's a poster.

GEORGIE	It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
ED	Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
GEORGIE	Hmm.  There's five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. You said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."

ED	Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
GEORGIE	Are you a fruit?
ED	No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
GEORGIE	So you're not a fruit?
ED	Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
GEORGIE	You gotta be kiddin' me.
ED	Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.

GEORGIE	And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
ED	Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.

ED	Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
GEORGIE	Tits.
ED	No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!

GEORGIE	Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
ED	Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
GEORGIE	Yeah.  Crap with a star.
ED	No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
GEORGIE	Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.

ED	What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
GEORGIE	Who?

GEORGIE	Lugosi?
ED	Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!
GEORGIE	Isn't he dead?
ED	No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
GEORGIE	OUR picture?
ED	Uh, yeah.  Our picture.

GEORGIE	Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
ED	Because he's <u>my friend</u>.

GEORGIE	I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
ED	There's still a sex-change --
GEORGIE	Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
ED	I don't think he's a schmuck.
GEORGIE	And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
ED	So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.

GEORGIE	Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
ED	Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
GEORGIE	<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
ED	I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.

GEORGIE	I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
ED	Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
GEORGIE	Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
ED	Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
GEORGIE	They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
ED	Um, I guess --
GEORGIE	Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
ED	Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
GEORGIE	And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.

ED	But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
GEORGIE	Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!

ED	Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
GEORGIE	I did.  I established some tits and ass.

GEORGIE	Where's the ads?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
ED	Why not??
GEORGIE	Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
ED	Maybe it needs special handling.
GEORGIE	Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
ED	You can't talk that way about my movie.
GEORGIE	Your movie?!  I wish it was your movie!  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again, I'll kill you!!!

ED	Hello.
KATHY	Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
ED	I got married last night.
KATHY	Oh.  Congratulations.
ED	The marriage already ended.
KATHY	Oh.  My condolences.

ED	What are you making?
KATHY	Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
ED	How long's he been here?
KATHY	This is my thirteenth pair.

KATHY	Oh, it's you again.
ED	Oh, hi.
KATHY	You look beat.
ED	I am.  How's your father?
KATHY	He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
ED	Not good...

KATHY	Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
ED	I just picked them up on the way over...
KATHY	They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.

KATHY	So have you always lived in L.A.?
ED	No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
KATHY	Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.

KATHY	Did you find it boring?
ED	Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...

KATHY	Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
ED	Yeah!  Don't forget "Mercury Theatre"... And then every Saturday, I'd go to the little movie theater down the street.  I even started ushering there.

KATHY	You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
ED	What do you mean?
KATHY	Dracula.

KATHY	That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
ED	I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
KATHY	A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.

ED	Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
KATHY	Huh?
ED	I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.

KATHY	Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
ED	No! I love sex with girls.
KATHY	Oh.  Okay.
ED	Okay?

ED	Stop!
KATHY	STOP!

KATHY	Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
ED	Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?

KATHY	What was that?
ED	Bela died.

ED	I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
KATHY	Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
ED	I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
KATHY	Well you tried --
ED	I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...

ED	You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
KATHY	Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
ED	The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
KATHY	Uh, atomic energy?
ED	No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
KATHY	Dynamite --
ED	No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
KATHY	The sun.
ED	Yes!  BINGO!  Solar energy!  Oh that's gonna seem so scientific.  This movie's gonna be the ultimate Ed Wood film.  <u>No compromises</u>.

ED	Those assholes.
KATHY	The poor girl's out of a job.
ED	Yeah...  I should give her a call.

KATHY	You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
ED	Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.

KATHY	Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
ED	Who's Dr. Tom?
KATHY	My chiropractor!

ED	I can't get it to go up.
KATHY	Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
ED	C'mon!  Let's just go.

KATHY	Ed, I'm so happy for you.
ED	Let's get married.
KATHY	Huh?!
ED	<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
KATHY	But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
ED	So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.

ED	Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
VAMPIRA	Yes?
ED	You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!

VAMPIRA	I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
ED	No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
VAMPIRA	You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
ED	No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?

VAMPIRA	Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and we're about to eat --
ED	Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
VAMPIRA	Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!

ED	No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
VAMPIRA	Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
ED	It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!

ED	I'm really sorry...
VAMPIRA	It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
ED	I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
VAMPIRA	The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...

VAMPIRA	Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
ED	You don't wanna be noticed?
VAMPIRA	Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!

ED	<u>It's uncanny</u>.
VAMPIRA	What's uncanny?
ED	LOOK AT HIS SKULL!

ED	Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
PAUL MARCO	Lines around the block.
ED	So don't take it too seriously. We're all doin' great work.

ED	The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
PAUL MARCO	I don't know.
ED	Well it looks good.  Let's use it!

ED	Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
PAUL MARCO	Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.

PAUL MARCO	Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
ED	Yeah...?
PAUL MARCO	Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!

ED	Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
PAUL MARCO	We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
ED	Nah, it'll work.  Where's Bela?

PAUL MARCO	Ed, you said you were getting permission.
ED	Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!

PAUL MARCO	You're sure this is gonna work?
ED	Yes!
PAUL MARCO	You're <u>sure</u>???
ED	YES!  JUST DO IT!

ED	Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
PAUL MARCO	What octopus motor?
ED	You know, to make the legs move --
PAUL MARCO	Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!

ED	Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
PAUL MARCO	So how long have you known Eddie?

PAUL MARCO	Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
ED	Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.

ED	Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
PAUL MARCO	Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
ED	That was Karloff.  Paul, you gotta try harder.  I don't want this film to be haif-assed. This time, we go for the quality.

REVEREND LEMON	...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
ED	I do.

ED	What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
REVEREND LEMON	Mr. Wood!

ED	Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
REVEREND LEMON	Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
ED	No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!

REVEREND LEMON	This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
ED	Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
REVEREND LEMON	I thought this was a group effort.
ED	NOOOOO!!!

REVEREND LEMON	Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
ED	I'm directing.

REVEREND LEMON	B-but it's our money --
ED	And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!

NORMA	Why... yes.
ED	Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
NORMA	I suppose.  It's very expensive.
ED	It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
NORMA	What are you, an angora wholesaler?
ED	No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
NORMA	Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
ED	Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
NORMA	Wow.
ED	You know, you're a very attractive girl.

NORMA	My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
ED	You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?

NORMA	Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
ED	Don't worry, I'll teach you.

NORMA	What the heck is THIS?!!
ED	Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.

ED	Please, be compassionate.  I'm your husband!
NORMA	No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!

ED'S VOICE	Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
VAMPIRA	Who?
ED'S VOICE	Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
VAMPIRA	Oh.  Yeah.  You.

ED'S VOICE	Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
VAMPIRA	You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
ED'S VOICE	ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
VAMPIRA	Isn't that the same thing?
ED'S VOICE	No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
VAMPIRA	Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.

ANNE	This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
LYDIA	But now it's free, right?
ANNE	Yeah.

ANNE	You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
LYDIA	Well did you or didn't you?
ANNE	Yes!  They'll be in soon.
LYDIA	Well, I guess I'll come back then.

LYDIA	I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
ANNE	Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.

LYDIA	I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
ANNE	Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
LYDIA	No, thank you.

LYDIA	Will it hurt?
ANNE	That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?

ANNE	...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
LYDIA	You threw him out?

LYDIA	My parents were divorced.
ANNE	It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".

ANNE	...SO...anybody special in your life?
LYDIA	Do I look like I have someone special?

ANNE	Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
LYDIA	Well, there's nobody special!
ANNE	Fine.
LYDIA	I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
ANNE	What?
LYDIA	Meeting ... people.
ANNE	Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
LYDIA	I never really...went through a... dating period.
ANNE	It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.

LYDIA	...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
ANNE	I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
LYDIA	I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
ANNE	I don't understand you. What is the problem?
LYDIA	I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
ANNE	That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
LYDIA	I'm paying you.

ANNE	You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
LYDIA	Really?
ANNE	Yeah!

LYDIA	Oh, no..I have to get home...
ANNE	The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.

LYDIA	No really..I can't.
ANNE	Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.

ANNE	Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
PARRY	Got any more bread crust?

ANNE	I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
PARRY	This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
ANNE	Jack, he's starting a conversation...

ANNE	<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
PARRY	I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
ANNE	Most men are.
PARRY	Why this is outrageous!...

PARRY	Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
ANNE	<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!

PARRY	Yep! Right on it!
ANNE	Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...

ANNE	Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
JACK	Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
ANNE	Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.

ANNE	Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
JACK	It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
ANNE	Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
JACK	Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.

ANNE	It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
JACK	Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.

JACK	I'm sorry.
ANNE	I smell gas... Do you smell gas...

ANNE	I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
JACK	I was attacked.
ANNE	<u>What</u>!
JACK	Two kids tried to set me on fire.
ANNE	<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!

ANNE	You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
JACK	No, I'm fine... really...
ANNE	You're all right... you sure...

ANNE	... So... where did you sleep last night?
JACK	I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
ANNE	Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.

JACK	I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
ANNE	Okay.  ... I love you...

ANNE	Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
JACK	You still believe in God?
ANNE	Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.

JACK	... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
ANNE	Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...

JACK	I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
ANNE	Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
JACK	I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
ANNE	You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
JACK	I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.

ANNE	Can I have my desk please.
JACK	Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
ANNE	Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
JACK	I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
ANNE	You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
JACK	What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
ANNE	... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
JACK	...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!

JACK	I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
ANNE	The moron?
JACK	He's not a moron.
ANNE	And who's Lydia?
JACK	Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
ANNE	What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
JACK	I... You're not going to understand this.
ANNE	Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
JACK	All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
ANNE	What does that mean?
JACK	See, I told you!
ANNE	Well, what the hell does that mean?
JACK	I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.

ANNE	Hello....congratulations.
JACK	And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....

ANNE	I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
JACK	He just needs some clothes?

JACK	Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
ANNE	Thank you very much.

ANNE	What are you two up to?
JACK	Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?

JACK	What do you think?
ANNE	I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.

JACK	You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
ANNE	Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
JACK	Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
ANNE	Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
JACK	You were great. Thanks alot.

ANNE	So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
JACK	My agent.  I called my agent.
ANNE	You're kidding!  What did he say?
JACK	He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
ANNE	<u>Whoah</u>!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!

JACK	I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
ANNE	<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!

ANNE	It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
JACK	Thanks.
ANNE	Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.

JACK	Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
ANNE	... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...

ANNE	... What?... You don't want to commute?
JACK	No, it's not... Come here...

JACK	What?
ANNE	I'm an incredible woman?  What is this, a death sentence?
JACK	No, I... I think we should talk about this.
ANNE	You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
JACK	No... it's just...

JACK	... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
ANNE	Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
JACK	Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.

JACK	... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
ANNE	First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
JACK	No.
ANNE	No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?

ANNE	You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
JACK	I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
ANNE	Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
JACK	All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.

ANNE	What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
JACK	<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
ANNE	Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
JACK	Then what do you want to stay with me for?

ANNE	Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
JACK	How have you been?
ANNE	Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..

JACK	I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
ANNE	Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!

JACK	Parry?
DOCTOR	He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
JACK	Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
DOCTOR	I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
JACK	But..How could that happen?
DOCTOR	Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
JACK	What if I was a relative?
DOCTOR	You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.

JACK	So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
EDWIN	I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...

JACK	Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
EDWIN	Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...

JACK	Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
EDWIN	I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
JACK	Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...

EDWIN	No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
JACK	She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
EDWIN	She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!

FRANK	Where you comin' from?!
JACK	Uh... basement I think...
FRANK	<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!

FRANK	You a friend of Parry's?
JACK	No...  He is supposed to live there?
FRANK	Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
JACK	Tragedy?
FRANK	He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.

FRANK	Can I help you?
JACK	I'm... just looking for Parry...
FRANK	He's not here.

GAY BUM	I wanna go...Just let me go...
JACK	Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
GAY BUM	A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
JACK	Where?  Maybe we can.
GAY BUM	No...no...we can't...we can't..
JACK	Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
GAY BUM	Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...

JACK	Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
GAY BUM	Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.

JACK	Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
GAY BUM	Oh please!...I was born a Catholic in Brooklyn... I've been to hell and back.... I'll be fine...  ....Thanks...You're a gem.

JACK	Remember. One chorus and out.
GAY BUM	I'm a man with a mission, Jack.

PARRY	It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
GAY BUM	NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
PARRY	Come on now...You can't sit here.
GAY BUM	NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!

GAY BUM	Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
PARRY	It was a crime.
GAY BUM	Leave me alone...I wanna go...

LEATHER	You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
JACK	I... I was just leaving.
LEATHER	People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
JACK	Yes... I... I agree...
LEATHER	Good.  You believe this drunk?

LEATHER	.....Me neither.
JACK	<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!

JACK	Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
SONDRA	You can ask.

JACK	About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
SONDRA	You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
JACK	You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
SONDRA	Fine.  I'll say no.
JACK	They're putting me on film tomorrow.
SONDRA	Fine.
JACK	... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
SONDRA	Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
JACK	I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
SONDRA	No, I have to work.
JACK	How un-sixties of you.
SONDRA	I was nine in the sixties.
JACK	I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...

JACK	Hello Lydia?
LYDIA	Yeah?  Who is this?

LYDIA	Yes.
JACK	Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
LYDIA	Huh-huh.
JACK	Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
LYDIA	Which ones?
JACK	All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.

JACK	Your name was picked.
LYDIA	Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
JACK	A list.
LYDIA	Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
JACK	Well there....  What's the difference?
LYDIA	Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
JACK	You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
LYDIA	Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
JACK	<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!

LYDIA	Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
JACK	Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.

LYDIA	So how do we do this?
JACK	Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...

LYDIA	Now what?
JACK	Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
LYDIA	Free?
JACK	Yes.  They're free.

JACK	You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
LYDIA	How much?
JACK	Well, since you're a member, we could...

LYDIA	Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
JACK	Tonight!  How's tonight?

JACK	Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
RECEPTIONIST	What girl?  I didn't notice.
JACK	Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...

RECEPTIONIST	Oh, Lydia!
JACK	Lydia.  Lydia what?
RECEPTIONIST	God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
JACK	No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...

PARRY	OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!

JACK	I need a drink.
PARRY	I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!

JACK	This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
PARRY	Great place huh?

JACK	Have I died?
PARRY	Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
JACK	If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.

JACK	Where am I?
PARRY	My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
JACK	No... thanks... Listen --
PARRY	My name is Parry.
JACK	Hi... Where are my shoes?
PARRY	They're --  -- What?
JACK	Where -- ?
PARRY	<u>What</u>!?
JACK	<u>What</u>?!
PARRY	Sshhhh!

PARRY	Do you know what the Little People just told me?
JACK	The Little People?
PARRY	They said you're The One.
JACK	I'm the one what?
PARRY	<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!

PARRY	... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
JACK	I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...

PARRY	... Do you know who I am?
JACK	Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
PARRY	Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.

JACK	Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
PARRY	No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
JACK	A quest?
PARRY	But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
JACK	The Little...
PARRY	They work for Him.
JACK	Him...?
PARRY	God... I'm the janitor of God.

JACK	The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
PARRY	I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
JACK	Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...

JACK	I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
PARRY	Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
JACK	I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
PARRY	But I can't get it... He's...

PARRY	See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
JACK	Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
PARRY	Parry.
JACK	Parry... I'm Jack.
PARRY	I know...

JACK	Thanks... You can keep the doll.
PARRY	Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.

JACK	I'm not married.
PARRY	Funny -- you look married.

PARRY	Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee....
JACK	Parry!

JACK	Do you follow her every day?
PARRY	Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
JACK	What's her name?
PARRY	I don't know.

JACK	Why did you do that?
PARRY	Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...

JACK	Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
PARRY	Fifty dollars?

JACK	Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
PARRY	No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...

JACK	That's O.K.
PARRY	Can I take you to lunch?
JACK	No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.

PARRY	Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
JACK	What are you doing?  Give that back!

JACK	But I gave it to you!
PARRY	Well what am I gonna do with it?
JACK	I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
PARRY	You really want to help me?

PARRY	Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
JACK	You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
PARRY	O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
JACK	All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
PARRY	Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
JACK	Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
PARRY	I don't need a job. I have a quest.
JACK	I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
PARRY	Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
JACK	No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.

PARRY	...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
JACK	Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
PARRY	I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!

JACK	Will you shut-up!!!
PARRY	You're a true <u>friend</u>.
JACK	I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
PARRY	You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
JACK	I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
PARRY	That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
JACK	I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
PARRY	So what? You going to help me?
JACK	WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...                               

PARRY	He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!
JACK	You're totally gone, aren't you?

PARRY	Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
JACK	WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!

JACK	SAW WHO!!?
PARRY	The Red Knight!
JACK	The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?

JACK	Parry...
PARRY	Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.

JACK	Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
PARRY	Who?
JACK	Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?

JACK	It's such a great song.
PARRY	It's a classic.

JACK	Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
PARRY	Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
JACK	Yes. I think that's very fair.

JACK	.....What are you doing?
PARRY	Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.

JACK	You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
PARRY	Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
JACK	NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!

JACK	..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
PARRY	Who are you talking to Jack?
JACK	YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
PARRY	Bingo!

PARRY	Are there any questions?
JACK	What?
PARRY	Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.

PARRY	I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
JACK	Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
PARRY	Maybe, when we get the Grail...
JACK	Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
PARRY	Happily married, probably.
JACK	Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
PARRY	Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
JACK	Sure...

PARRY	Holdin' my penis...
JACK	<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...

JACK	Will you stand still so I can do this!
PARRY	I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
JACK	In a bar called Hellfire.
PARRY	Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
JACK	No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
PARRY	What are the other reasons?

PARRY	...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
JACK	No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
PARRY	I'm still scared.

JACK	Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
PARRY	I know!

PARRY	Beautiful night huh?
JACK	Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?

PARRY	Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
LEATHER	It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
PARRY	Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...

LEATHER	You a fag too?











LYDIA	Parry Parry?
PARRY	No just Parry.
LYDIA	Oh...like Moses.

PARRY	How about the "Hell Merchants"?
LYDIA	I don't like horror movies!
PARRY	How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
LYDIA	I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
PARRY	Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
LYDIA	Got any Ethel Merman?

PARRY	... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
LYDIA	What a gyp.
PARRY	Yeah.

LYDIA	...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
PARRY	It sounds exciting.
LYDIA	Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.

LYDIA	We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
PARRY	Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...

LYDIA	How do you know him?
PARRY	We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.

LYDIA	What do you do - for a living I mean?
PARRY	Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.

PARRY	Tell me more. I want to know everything.
LYDIA	There isn't any more to tell.
PARRY	Don't say that.
LYDIA	No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
PARRY	Well, it's enough for me.
LYDIA	You don't have to say that.
PARRY	I never say anything I have to.
LYDIA	I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
PARRY	What are we about to do?
LYDIA	Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
PARRY	I don't drink coffee...
LYDIA	... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
PARRY	I don't drink coffee...
LYDIA	And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..

PARRY	Excuse me...
LYDIA	Listen, I'm not feeling well.
PARRY	Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
LYDIA	Listen, you're very nice... b...
PARRY	So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
LYDIA	Oh... You mean you don't want to.
PARRY	Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
LYDIA	You're married.
PARRY	No.
LYDIA	Divorced.
PARRY	No, I...
LYDIA	You have a disease.
PARRY	Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...

PARRY	... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
LYDIA	Shhh...

APRIL	...any sister talk?
HANNAH	Mm-mm!

APRIL	Oh, good...
HANNAH	Come in, come in.
APRIL	...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
HANNAH	Oh, listen...

APRIL	Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
HANNAH	Mmm?
APRIL	He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?

APRIL	I love that.  That's my type.
HANNAH	I can't believe it!

APRIL	We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
DAVID	I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
APRIL	Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crÃªpes caviar.

DAVID	And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
APRIL	Well, let's hope so.

DAVID	Hi.
APRIL	Oh.

APRIL	Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
DAVID	Are you really interested?
APRIL	Yeah.

DAVID	You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
APRIL	Oh--

APRIL	What are your favorite buildings, David?
DAVID	You want to see some?
APRIL	Oh, yeah.
DAVID	Well, let's do it.
APRIL	Great.

APRIL	That's just --
DAVID	Look at this.

DAVID	Yeah.
APRIL	A lot of works.

DAVID	Uh, who gets dropped first?
APRIL	Uh --

APRIL	Yeah.
DAVID	And then, uh, April...huh?
APRIL	Great.

HOLLY	I know.  It's terrible!
APRIL	I mean, I've looked everywhere.

APRIL	No, really, I really like him a lot.
HOLLY	No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.

HOLLY	Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
APRIL	Mmm.

HOLLY	We're a big hit.
APRIL	Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.

HOLLY	Wow, it's the red one?
APRIL	Oh, it's magnificent!

HOLLY	Oh!
APRIL	Oh, is that what it is?
HOLLY	Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
HOLLY	Right.
APRIL	It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.

APRIL	It's French, though.  It really is.
HOLLY	Yeah.
APRIL	It feels like you're in France.

HOLLY	That's disgusting!
APRIL	...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
HOLLY	It's really terrible.

APRIL	Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
HOLLY	Yeah.

APRIL	Oh, geez, yeah.
HOLLY	Okay.

APRIL	Well, I live downtown.
HOLLY	Yeah, I, we both live downtown.

APRIL	Uh...
HOLLY	It depends on what way you want to go.
APRIL	Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
HOLLY	Uh...
APRIL	If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?

APRIL	Well, sometimes, some, uh...
HOLLY	I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...

HOLLY	I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
APRIL	Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
HOLLY	Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
APRIL	Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
HOLLY	What?
APRIL	Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
HOLLY	You're joking.
APRIL	No, he called late last night.
HOLLY	I, uh, I'm very surprised.
APRIL	He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
HOLLY	And you, you-you're going?
APRIL	Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
HOLLY	But I'm seeing him.
APRIL	I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
HOLLY	Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
APRIL	Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?

CAROL	Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
NORMAN	No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.

NORMAN	Mm-hm.
CAROL	Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.

NORMAN	We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
CAROL	Right.
NORMAN	Hmm?
CAROL	Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.

NORMAN	I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
CAROL	Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
NORMAN	And maybe my lawyer.

DAVID	Excuse me, are there any more claims?
HOLLY	Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
DAVID	I can't resist.
HOLLY	Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
DAVID	Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
HOLLY	We're actresses.
DAVID	Is this your first job?
HOLLY	Really?  Is the food that bad?
DAVID	Oh no.  Not at all.

HOLLY	Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
DAVID	Ah! HOLLY  Now.

DAVID	You're Holly.
HOLLY	Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
DAVID	Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
HOLLY	What makes you think we're more interesting?

HOLLY	We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
DAVID	I cry at the opera.

HOLLY	Oh, what, what do you do?
DAVID	I'm an architect.

HOLLY	Yeah.
DAVID	What time do you get off?

DAVID	Yeah.
HOLLY	It's terrific!

DAVID	The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
HOLLY	Uh-huh.
DAVID	And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 

HOLLY	Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
DAVID	Yes.
HOLLY	...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --

DAVID	And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
HOLLY	Yeah.
DAVID	They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...

DAVID	It's really sad.
HOLLY	And it ruins everything else.
DAVID	It does.

HOLLY	Yeah.
DAVID	Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
HOLLY	Fast.

HOLLY	Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
DAVID	Well...

DAVID	We could...we could do that.
HOLLY	Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?

DAVID	Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
HOLLY	Yes.
DAVID	Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
HOLLY	Oh, okay.

DR. ABEL	So what's the, uh, problem this time?
MICKEY	This time I really think I have something.

MICKEY	So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
DR. ABEL	You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
MICKEY	Mm-hm.
DR. ABEL	...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
MICKEY	Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
DR. ABEL	You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
MICKEY	Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.

MICKEY	Now I ca-can't remember.
DR. ABEL	Let's take a look.

DR. ABEL	Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
MICKEY	Really?!

DR. ABEL	Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
MICKEY	No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.

MICKEY	I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
DR. ABEL	When did you first notice this?
MICKEY	Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?

DR. ABEL	You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
MICKEY	Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
DR. ABEL	And it's just in one ear?
MICKEY	Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?

DR. ABEL	What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
MICKEY	The hospital?  What kind of tests?

DR. ABEL	Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
MICKEY	Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
DR. ABEL	You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
MICKEY	Like what?
DR. ABEL	It's nothing.  Will you trust me?

ELLIOT	Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
DUSTY	Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 

DUSTY	How ya doin', man?
ELLIOT	I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
DUSTY	Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  Big, weird...you know.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.

DUSTY	What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
ELLIOT	Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
DUSTY	It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
ELLIOT	Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
DUSTY	Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.

LEE	Hi, Dusty.
DUSTY	Hi.

LEE	Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
LEE	Yeah?
DUSTY	I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
LEE	Uh-huh.

LEE	Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
DUSTY	Well, are...are they big?
LEE	Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
DUSTY	'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 

MICKEY	You--  Standards and Practices?
ED	Ed Smythe, yes.
MICKEY	Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 

ED	Child molestation is a touchy subject...
MICKEY	Could you--
ED	...with the affiliates.
MICKEY	Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
ED	Yes, but you name names.
MICKEY	We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.

MICKEY	We--
ED	...cannot go on the air.

LEE	Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
ELLIOT	How's Frederick?  He didn't come.

LEE	Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
ELLIOT	Oh, great.

ELLIOT	Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
LEE	Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.

ELLIOT	Like, uh...?
LEE	I don't know exactly.

ELLIOT	Yeah.
LEE	...ex-husband on the street the other day.

ELLIOT	Oh, my goodness!
LEE	Oh, Elliot!
ELLIOT	Hi.
LEE	What are you doing here?
ELLIOT	Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
LEE	Oh, what, in this section of town?
ELLIOT	Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
LEE	You're out looking here?
ELLIOT	Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
LEE	Ohhhh!
ELLIOT	How about you?
LEE	Oh.  Well, I live--
ELLIOT	Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
LEE	Yes, I do.
ELLIOT	Where are you headed?
LEE	Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.

LEE	Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
ELLIOT	Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
LEE	Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.

ELLIOT	I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
LEE	Oh, God.
ELLIOT	I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
LEE	Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
ELLIOT	Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
ELLIOT	Yes?
LEE	Yeah, you would.
ELLIOT	Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
LEE	Yeah, sure. 

LEE	Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
ELLIOT	Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
LEE	What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?

ELLIOT	Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
LEE	Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.

ELLIOT	Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
LEE	No, I don't have time.

ELLIOT	No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
LEE	You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
ELLIOT	No!  No...
LEE	No?
ELLIOT	Uh, yes!
LEE	Yes?

ELLIOT	Yes.
LEE	Everything's okay? 

ELLIOT	Yeah.  How are you?
LEE	I'm...all right.
ELLIOT	How-how's Frederick?

LEE	Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
ELLIOT	Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!

ELLIOT	e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
LEE	Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
ELLIOT	Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
LEE	No, I don't think so.
ELLIOT	I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
LEE	Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
ELLIOT	Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
LEE	Well, sure.
ELLIOT	And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.

LEE	Well, thanks a lot.
ELLIOT	Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
LEE	Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
ELLIOT	And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.

ELLIOT	Page a hundred and twelve.
LEE	Bye.
ELLIOT	Bye.

ELLIOT	How's everything?
LEE	Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
ELLIOT	Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
LEE	Oh, yeah.
ELLIOT	But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.

LEE	I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
ELLIOT	Oh, that's nice.

ELLIOT	I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
LEE	Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
ELLIOT	Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
LEE	Oh.
ELLIOT	He's got like six gold records.
LEE	Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...

ELLIOT	Oh, you-you have that one?
LEE	Yeah.
ELLIOT	Oh, I would love to hear it.

LEE	Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
ELLIOT	Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 

LEE	Isn't that beautiful?
ELLIOT	I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.

ELLIOT	Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
LEE	Yes, he's just adorable.

LEE	They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
ELLIOT	Oh, right.

ELLIOT	Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
LEE	Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.

ELLIOT	And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
LEE	Did you ever read this one--?

LEE	Elliot!  Don't!
ELLIOT	Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.

ELLIOT	Oh!
LEE	What are you doing?!
ELLIOT	I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.

LEE	Elliot!
ELLIOT	I have been in love with you for so long.

LEE	I was looking for you.
ELLIOT	I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
LEE	Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?

ELLIOT	Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
LEE	Oh, don't say those words!
ELLIOT	I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
LEE	Why, you know the situation.

ELLIOT	I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
LEE	What do you expect me to say?
ELLIOT	Hannah and I are in the last stages.
LEE	Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
ELLIOT	Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
LEE	Not because of me, I hope.
ELLIOT	Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
LEE	Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
ELLIOT	Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
LEE	Why?
ELLIOT	Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
LEE	But not over me?
ELLIOT	Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
LEE	Poor Hannah.
ELLIOT	But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
LEE	I can't say anything!
ELLIOT	W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
LEE	Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?

ELLIOT	O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
LEE	Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
ELLIOT	Yes, but you, you do care about me.
LEE	Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!

ELLIOT	Your guilt is because you feel the same.
LEE	Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.

ELLIOT	I thought you weren't coming.
LEE	I almost didn't.
ELLIOT	Lee... uh...
LEE	I didn't sleep all night.
ELLIOT	No, no-no-no, I'm sure.

ELLIOT	I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
LEE	I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.

ELLIOT	This is not an easy situation.
LEE	I know it isn't.

LEE	That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
ELLIOT	I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
LEE	I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
ELLIOT	Oh, my God.

ELLIOT	You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
LEE	Oh, all the time.

LEE	I know she must be a really passionate person.
ELLIOT	Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
LEE	I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.

ELLIOT	You've been very cold to me tonight.
LEE	No.
ELLIOT	Is something wrong?
LEE	Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.

LEE	It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
ELLIOT	Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
LEE	Look, I'm just as much at fault.
ELLIOT	If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
LEE	I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.

ELLIOT	But it hasn't been forever. 
LEE	It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
ELLIOT	Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
LEE	Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.

ELLIOT	And you're in love overnight?
LEE	I care a great deal about him, yes.
ELLIOT	Lee...
LEE	Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!

ELLIOT	Mm-hm?
HANNAH	Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.

ELLIOT	They're fantastic.
HANNAH	Aren't they great?
ELLIOT	Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
HANNAH	I know!  I know!

HANNAH	She has all the cooking talent.
ELLIOT	No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
HANNAH	Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.

ELLIOT	Great idea.
HANNAH	I know.
ELLIOT	That's where your talent lies.

HANNAH	God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
ELLIOT	Let's go have dinner, shall we?
HANNAH	Mmm.

ELLIOT	You bet.
HANNAH	Holly and April, thanks for helping.

HANNAH	Where're you going?
ELLIOT	I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
HANNAH	It's so late.
ELLIOT	Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.

HANNAH	Are you in a bad mood?
ELLIOT	I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.

HANNAH	Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
ELLIOT	Was I?
HANNAH	Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
ELLIOT	Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
HANNAH	Why not?
ELLIOT	Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
HANNAH	Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
ELLIOT	I don't know.
HANNAH	Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
ELLIOT	But, you got four children!
HANNAH	I want one with you.
ELLIOT	Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
HANNAH	But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
ELLIOT	You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
HANNAH	Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
ELLIOT	I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.

ELLIOT	Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
HANNAH	Are you angry with me?
ELLIOT	No!
HANNAH	Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
ELLIOT	I didn't say that.
HANNAH	Are you in love with someone else?
ELLIOT	My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.

HANNAH	Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
ELLIOT	What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
HANNAH	Are you?
ELLIOT	No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
HANNAH	What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!

HANNAH	Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
ELLIOT	Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.

HANNAH	I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
ELLIOT	No.

HANNAH	Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
ELLIOT	Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.

HANNAH	Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
ELLIOT	Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.

HANNAH	Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
ELLIOT	Leave me alone, can you?!

HANNAH	You matter to me.  Completely.
ELLIOT	It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!

HANNAH	It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
ELLIOT	You're not lost.

EVAN	...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
HANNAH	Get his wine away.
EVAN	This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...

HANNAH	I am... I did slave all day.
EVAN	And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!

HANNAH	I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
EVAN	Yeah.
HANNAH	...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.

HANNAH	Hi.  How's she doing?
EVAN	I am glad to see you.

HANNAH	Don't make it worse, Dad.
EVAN	Always.

HANNAH	Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
EVAN	We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...

EVAN	I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
HANNAH	It's on the table, Dad.

HANNAH	Oh, Mom!
EVAN	Oh, honey!

MICKEY	I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
FATHER	How can we be happy?

MICKEY	Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
FATHER	But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
MICKEY	Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
MICKEY	I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
FATHER	But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
MICKEY	So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.

FATHER	Why should I be afraid?
MICKEY	Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
FATHER	So?
MICKEY	That thought doesn't terrify you?

FATHER	Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
MICKEY	I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
FATHER	Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
MICKEY	Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
FATHER	How do you know?
MICKEY	Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.

FATHER	I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
MICKEY	Mom, come out!

LEE	Want some coffee or tea?
FREDERICK	No, thank you.

LEE	How about something to eat?
FREDERICK	No, nothing.

LEE	Are you sure?
FREDERICK	Absolutely.
LEE	Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? 

LEE	God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
FREDERICK	I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
LEE	You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
FREDERICK	Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 

FREDERICK	Isn't it enough that I can love you?
LEE	Mmm...
FREDERICK	Hmm?
LEE	...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 

FREDERICK	Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
LEE	Mm-hm.
FREDERICK	Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.

LEE	Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
FREDERICK	Because he likes you.
LEE	Me?
FREDERICK	Yeah.

FREDERICK	Elliot lusts after you.
LEE	Based on what?  You never even see him.

FREDERICK	...or films you must see or... 
LEE	Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.

LEE	Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
FREDERICK	They're in the basement.

FREDERICK	I don't sell my work by the yard!
LEE	Oh, Frederick!

LEE	What's the problem?
FREDERICK	I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!

LEE	Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
FREDERICK	You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.

FREDERICK	You know, you've been very nervous lately.
LEE	I can't take this anymore.
FREDERICK	I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
LEE	I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
FREDERICK	When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.

FREDERICK	Like what?
LEE	Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
FREDERICK	Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
LEE	Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
FREDERICK	Why?
LEE	Because I have to!
FREDERICK	What are you going to use for money?!
LEE	I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
FREDERICK	Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
LEE	Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
FREDERICK	Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
LEE	No.
FREDERICK	Oh, yes, you have!
LEE	No.
FREDERICK	You've been with someone!
LEE	Stop accusing me!

FREDERICK	Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
LEE	I'm sorry.
FREDERICK	Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
LEE	I'm saying it now!
FREDERICK	So you met somebody else?
LEE	Yeah.

LEE	But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
FREDERICK	Who is it?
LEE	What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
FREDERICK	But who?  Where did you meet him?
LEE	It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
FREDERICK	You are, you are my only connection to the world!

LEE	Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
FREDERICK	Jesus...Jesus!
LEE	Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
FREDERICK	Oh...
LEE	Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--

GAIL	Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
MICKEY	You know... 

GAIL	In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
MICKEY	No--

MICKEY	Look at this guy.
GAIL	Yeah?

MICKEY	Oh, Jesus!
GAIL	Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.

MICKEY	N-n-no, not that.
GAIL	Hello?
MICKEY	Like-- 

GAIL	You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
GAIL	But not you.
MICKEY	Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?

GAIL	Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
MICKEY	I can't keep my mind on the show.
GAIL	But there's nothing wrong with you.
MICKEY	If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
GAIL	Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
MICKEY	Like what?!  What?
GAIL	I don't know.  Cancer, I--
MICKEY	Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
GAIL	But you don't have any symptoms!
MICKEY	You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!

GAIL	Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
MICKEY	Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
GAIL	It was on your shirt!
MICKEY	I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.

GAIL	Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
MICKEY	No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.

MICKEY	Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
GAIL	Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
MICKEY	Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
GAIL	Yeah...but you're not dying!
MICKEY	No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.

GAIL	You're just realizing this now?
MICKEY	Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...

GAIL	Yeah.  What?
MICKEY	Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
GAIL	Yes, please.
MICKEY	A week ago, I bought a rifle.
GAIL	No.
MICKEY	I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
GAIL	Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
MICKEY	Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...

MICKEY	...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
GAIL	I know, I know, and your hamster.
MICKEY	Yes!
GAIL	Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.

GAIL	Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
MICKEY	I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.

HANNAH	Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
LEE	I think they're fantastic.
HANNAH	You've outdone yourself.

HANNAH	Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
LEE	Okay.

LEE	Oh, great.
HANNAH	You look so beautiful.
LEE	Come on.
HANNAH	Doesn't she look pretty?
LEE	I bumped into your...

HANNAH	Oh, yeah?
LEE	He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 

HANNAH	Hi.  Where's Holly?
LEE	Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
HANNAH	Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?

HANNAH	I hope you tell her it was your idea...
LEE	Why?
HANNAH	...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
LEE	Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.

HANNAH	So how are you?
LEE	Oh, me, I'm okay.
HANNAH	Do you miss Frederick?
LEE	No.
HANNAH	I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
LEE	How are you?
HANNAH	I'm okay.
LEE	You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
HANNAH	Y-yeah.

HANNAH	Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
LEE	Really?
HANNAH	Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
LEE	Oh...
HANNAH	I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
LEE	Like what?

HANNAH	I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
LEE	Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.

HANNAH	What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
LEE	You are, Holly.  Stop it.

LEE	Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
HANNAH	Oh, now-- 
LEE	She's going through a really rough time right now.

HANNAH	What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
LEE	I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
HANNAH	Yeah?
LEE	I think we need to eat.

LEE	Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
HANNAH	I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
LEE	Yeah.  I'll get some ice.

HANNAH	Hi!  Hi!
MICKEY	I know...I know.
HANNAH	Glad you could put in an appearance.
MICKEY	I got two minutes.
HANNAH	Very good.

MICKEY	I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
HANNAH	Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.

MICKEY	Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
HANNAH	Huh?
MICKEY	...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?

MICKEY	How is everything?
HANNAH	Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
MICKEY	Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
HANNAH	Here, you guys.  Open them up.

MICKEY	Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
HANNAH	He's fine.
MICKEY	Yeah?
HANNAH	Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
MICKEY	Oh!
HANNAH	I think he'll find that satisfying.
MICKEY	Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
HANNAH	I think so.
MICKEY	I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
HANNAH	Yeah.
MICKEY	The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?

HANNAH	Ohh!
MICKEY	H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
HANNAH	I know, I know.
MICKEY	...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
HANNAH	That's really nice!
MICKEY	...you know?  I, uh...
HANNAH	You know, he's been wanting a mitt.

MICKEY	You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
HANNAH	Thanks, thanks.
MICKEY	Mh-hm.
HANNAH	That's a beauty!
MICKEY	Isn't that great?
HANNAH	Oh!
MICKEY	Go right over there.
HANNAH	Football!

MICKEY	Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
HANNAH	Wow!
MICKEY	Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.

MICKEY	Gee.
HANNAH	Is there no chance?

HANNAH	This is the second opinion.
MICKEY	Well, then a third opinion.

MICKEY	I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
HANNAH	Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
MICKEY	How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
HANNAH	I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
MICKEY	Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!

MICKEY	Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
HANNAH	Well, what about artificial insemination?
MICKEY	What are you talking about?
HANNAH	You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
MICKEY	What, by a st-stranger?

HANNAH	Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
MICKEY	Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
HANNAH	I want to experience childbirth.
MICKEY	With a, with a stranger?  With a--
HANNAH	Just think about it.  That's all I ask.

MICKEY	Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
HANNAH	W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.

HANNAH	Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
MICKEY	Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...

NORMA	Hey!
HANNAH	...from Mavis, also.

HANNAH	Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
NORMA	No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
HANNAH	You promised to stay on the wagon.
NORMA	The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
HANNAH	Okay, stop being so dramatic.
NORMA	He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
HANNAH	Okay, okay.
NORMA	Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
HANNAH	Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!

HANNAH	I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
NORMA	Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
HANNAH	Now, Holly's not shy.

NORMA	No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
HANNAH	True.
NORMA	I'd have been a great dope addict.

HANNAH	What?  You're kidding!
HOLLY	No, no, we decided!

HANNAH	Perfect!
HOLLY	Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.

HOLLY	Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
HANNAH	Oh, sure.

HOLLY	Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
HANNAH	Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
HOLLY	This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.

HANNAH	Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
HOLLY	Someday, I'll pay it all back.
HANNAH	I know.  H-how much do you need?
HOLLY	Two thousand dollars.

HANNAH	Uh-huh.
HOLLY	Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.

HOLLY	You admit that we're great cooks, right?
HANNAH	Yeah.
HOLLY	Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
HANNAH	Will you just tell me one thing?
HOLLY	Okay.
HANNAH	Are we talking about cocaine again?
HOLLY	I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.

HANNAH	Ohh?
HOLLY	Uh-oh.

HANNAH	Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
HOLLY	Yeah.

HANNAH	Don't you think she does?
HOLLY	She really does, though.

HANNAH	Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
HOLLY	I should get a garter belt.

HOLLY	Frederick didn't come with her.
HANNAH	When does Frederick ever come with her?
HOLLY	Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!

HANNAH	Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
HOLLY	Oh, your kids are so adorable.

HOLLY	Oh, Hannah!
HANNAH	It's, uh, you never know--
HOLLY	He's such a loser!
HANNAH	He's not a loser at all!
HOLLY	Oh, he's such a loser!
HANNAH	He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
HOLLY	Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.

HOLLY	Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
HANNAH	Here.  Be careful with those.
HOLLY	Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.

HOLLY	Ouch!
HANNAH	Oh!

HOLLY	You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
HOLLY	Well, how about this?
HANNAH	Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
HOLLY	Oh, yeah. 

HOLLY	He's married...
HANNAH	Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.

HOLLY	Sometimes she's terrific...
HANNAH	Oooo.
HOLLY	...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
HANNAH	Oh?
HOLLY	...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...

HANNAH	You found all this, all this out on one date?
HOLLY	Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?

HOLLY	I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
HANNAH	Singing?
HOLLY	Yeah, can you believe it?
HANNAH	Really?
HOLLY	Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
HANNAH	Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.

HOLLY	Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
HANNAH	No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.

HANNAH	Ohh!
HOLLY	You know.
HANNAH	I know, no--  I know.
HOLLY	I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
HANNAH	No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.

HOLLY	Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
HANNAH	Uh-huh.
HOLLY	Easily.

HOLLY	W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
HANNAH	No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
HOLLY	Yeah.

HANNAH	...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
HOLLY	Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
HANNAH	I hope.

HOLLY	Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
HANNAH	What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
HOLLY	Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!

HOLLY	Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
HANNAH	Look, everything's going your way.

HANNAH	Hey, hi!
HOLLY	Well, I just came from an audition...

HANNAH	Awwww...
HOLLY	So what's new?

HANNAH	Boy--
HOLLY	They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
HANNAH	Oh, what do they know?

HANNAH	Oh, gosh.
HOLLY	You got it.

HANNAH	Oh, God...
HOLLY	Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 

HANNAH	Well, that...th-that's fine.
HOLLY	But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.

HANNAH	Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
HOLLY	Well-well, like what?

HANNAH	Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
HOLLY	Yeah, that's clerical.
HANNAH	No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.

HOLLY	Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
HANNAH	I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
HOLLY	Yeah, you mean not at my age.

HOLLY	You treat me like a loser.
HANNAH	How?
HOLLY	You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.

HANNAH	Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
HOLLY	Hmm!
HANNAH	I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
HOLLY	Uh, losers!  All losers!
HANNAH	You're too demanding.
HOLLY	You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!

HANNAH	You're crazy!  That's not true.
HOLLY	Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.

HOLLY	What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
HANNAH	Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
HOLLY	What's the matter?
HANNAH	Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
HOLLY	Good.
HANNAH	Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.

HOLLY	Hey, what's the matter?
HANNAH	I'm real upset about what you wrote.

HOLLY	My script?
HANNAH	It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
HOLLY	Oh, so loosely.
HANNAH	No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
HOLLY	Well--
HANNAH	Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?

HOLLY	Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
HANNAH	You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
HOLLY	Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
HANNAH	You're grateful, but you resent me.
HOLLY	Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.

HOLLY	Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
HANNAH	Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!

HOLLY	Well, why don't you share them with us?
HANNAH	I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
HOLLY	That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
HANNAH	I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
HOLLY	No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.

HOLLY	Oh, why are you making those faces?
MICKEY	I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
HOLLY	Listen, you are witnessing genius!
MICKEY	I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
HOLLY	Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!

MICKEY	Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
HOLLY	You want some?

HOLLY	Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
MICKEY	But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.

MICKEY	Can we, can we go?
HOLLY	No!
MICKEY	My--uh...

HOLLY	I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
MICKEY	Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
HOLLY	Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
HOLLY	Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
MICKEY	Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
HOLLY	Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
MICKEY	Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.

HOLLY	Thanks for a swell time.
MICKEY	Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
HOLLY	I was so bored!
MICKEY	Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
HOLLY	At least I'm open to new concepts!
MICKEY	And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
HOLLY	This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
MICKEY	Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.

HOLLY	Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
MICKEY	Yeah.  Me, too.
HOLLY	You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
MICKEY	Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
HOLLY	God!
MICKEY	...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.

MICKEY	Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
HOLLY	I remember you.
MICKEY	Yes, you do recall, right?
HOLLY	I recall you.
MICKEY	I was walking past and I saw you in here...
HOLLY	Yeah.
MICKEY	...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
HOLLY	We didn't hit it off.
MICKEY	Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
HOLLY	How are you?
MICKEY	Good.  How are you?
HOLLY	I'm fine.
MICKEY	You look wonderful.
HOLLY	Oh, no.
MICKEY	Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
HOLLY	Yeah?
MICKEY	It was a terrible evening.
HOLLY	Yeah, it was.
MICKEY	Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... 

HOLLY	I'd never do that.
MICKEY	...in a really horrible way.
HOLLY	Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
MICKEY	You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
HOLLY	People change...you know.
MICKEY	Well, I hope you've changed.
HOLLY	Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
HOLLY	Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
MICKEY	...namely a personality.

MICKEY	So how are you?
HOLLY	I'm okay.
MICKEY	You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
HOLLY	Oh, nothing much.  You know...
MICKEY	Well...
HOLLY	...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
MICKEY	Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
HOLLY	Probably not.
MICKEY	Are you, are you out of work or something?
HOLLY	No, well...I've been trying to write.
MICKEY	Have you?
HOLLY	Yeah.
MICKEY	Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
HOLLY	Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
MICKEY	No, you can tell me.
HOLLY	Come on.
MICKEY	No, I am.  I am.
HOLLY	Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
MICKEY	Nobody ever said it.
HOLLY	Really?
MICKEY	This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
MICKEY	Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
HOLLY	No, the reason I ask is--
MICKEY	You've always hated my taste in the past.
HOLLY	No, I haven't.
MICKEY	You have.
HOLLY	I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
MICKEY	I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
HOLLY	You're kidding me.
MICKEY	I've done no television whatsoever. No.

MICKEY	I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
HOLLY	Oh.  Oh.
MICKEY	...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--

HOLLY	You're okay, though, huh?
MICKEY	I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
HOLLY	Oh, I'm fine.
MICKEY	What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
HOLLY	Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
MICKEY	You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.

HOLLY	But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
MICKEY	Hmm.
HOLLY	Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
MICKEY	Yeah.
HOLLY	...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--

MICKEY	Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
HOLLY	Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.

MICKEY	Really?
HOLLY	So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.

MICKEY	Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
HOLLY	Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
MICKEY	Come over tomorrow and read it to me?

MICKEY	You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
HOLLY	Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
MICKEY	Well, what about me?
HOLLY	Oh, well.
MICKEY	I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...

HOLLY	No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
MICKEY	It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
HOLLY	Really?
MICKEY	Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
HOLLY	Oh, it just came to me one day.
MICKEY	Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
HOLLY	Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
MICKEY	I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
HOLLY	Right.
MICKEY	...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
HOLLY	Oh!
MICKEY	Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.

HOLLY	Oh, God!
MICKEY	I am.  You-you made my day.
HOLLY	Oh, wow!
MICKEY	It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
HOLLY	Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
MICKEY	I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
HOLLY	Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
MICKEY	Oh, who cares?
HOLLY	Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!

HOLLY	Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
MICKEY	Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...

HOLLY	Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
MICKEY	Oh, yeah?  What?
HOLLY	That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
MICKEY	Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
HOLLY	It's all right.
MICKEY	I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 

MICKEY	So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
HOLLY	Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
MICKEY	Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
HOLLY	Yeah.

MICKEY	Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
HOLLY	Hi.
MICKEY	Hi.  How you doin'?
HOLLY	Okay.
MICKEY	When'd you get here?
HOLLY	Just a few minutes ago.
MICKEY	Oh.  You look so beautiful.

HOLLY	Thanks.
MICKEY	You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
HOLLY	Tch.
MICKEY	I don't know how you're gonna top that.

HOLLY	Mickey?
MICKEY	Mmm, what?
HOLLY	I'm pregnant.

HOLLY	Oh, my God.  Thank you.
LEE	I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...

HOLLY	Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
LEE	At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
HOLLY	Mm-hm.

LEE	Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
HOLLY	God.

LEE	Yeah.
HOLLY	Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
LEE	Where are the antihistamines?

HOLLY	Dad...
LEE	Oh...
HOLLY	Dad!

LEE	Hi.
HOLLY	...which I did not get.

HOLLY	Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
LEE	April?

HOLLY	Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
LEE	Hmm.

LEE	Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
HOLLY	Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?

LEE	Boy...Holly...Holly.
HOLLY	I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?

HOLLY	Why are you so upset?
LEE	You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 

KRISHNA LEADER	What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
MICKEY	Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
KRISHNA LEADER	Yeah, well, what's your religion?
MICKEY	Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
KRISHNA LEADER	You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
KRISHNA LEADER	Take our literature...
MICKEY	Uh-huh.
KRISHNA LEADER	...read it over, and think about it.
MICKEY	Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
KRISHNA LEADER	You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.

BEDEVERE	How do you know she is a witch?
ALL	She looks like one. Yes, she does.
BEDEVERE	Bring her forward.

ALL	A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
BEDEVERE	Did you dress her up like this?

ALL	Burn her anyway.
BEDEVERE	Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.

ALL	There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
BEDEVERE	Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
ALL	Burn them.
BEDEVERE	And what do you burn, apart from witches?

ALL	I see.  Yes, of course.
BEDEVERE	So how can we tell if she is made of wood?

ALL	Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
BEDEVERE	Does wood sink in water?
ALL	No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
BEDEVERE	Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
ALL	Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...

SOLDIER	Halt!  Who goes there?
ARTHUR	It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!

SOLDIER	Get away!
ARTHUR	I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
SOLDIER	What?  Ridden on a horse?
ARTHUR	Yes!
SOLDIER	You're using coconuts!
ARTHUR	...What?
SOLDIER	You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
ARTHUR	So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
SOLDIER	Where did you get the coconuts?
ARTHUR	Through ... We found them.
SOLDIER	Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
ARTHUR	What do you mean?
SOLDIER	Well, this is a temperate zone.
ARTHUR	The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
SOLDIER	Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
ARTHUR	Not at all.  They could be carried.
SOLDIER	What? A swallow carrying a coconut?

SOLDIER	It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
ARTHUR	Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.

SOLDIER	Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
ARTHUR	Please!
SOLDIER	Am I right?
ARTHUR	I'm not interested.

ARTHUR	Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
SOOTHSAYER	He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
ARTHUR	And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?

SOOTHSAYER	There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
ARTHUR	But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
SOOTHSAYER	Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
ARTHUR	The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?

OLD WOMAN	Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
ARTHUR	How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
OLD WOMAN	King of the WHO?
ARTHUR	The Britons.
OLD WOMAN	Who are the Britons?
ARTHUR	All of us are ... we are all Britons.

ARTHUR	Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
OLD WOMAN	No one live there.
ARTHUR	Well, who is your lord?
OLD WOMAN	We don't have a lord.
ARTHUR	What?

OLD WOMAN	Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
ARTHUR	I am your king!
OLD WOMAN	Well, I didn't vote for you.
ARTHUR	You don't vote for kings.
OLD WOMAN	Well, how did you become king, then?
ARTHUR	The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

TALL KNIGHT	The same!
ARTHUR	Who are they?
TALL KNIGHT	We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee ... Wom!

ARTHUR	Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
TALL KNIGHT	NI!
ARTHUR	Oh!
TALL KNIGHT	NI!   NI!
ARTHUR	Oh!
TALL KNIGHT	We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
ARTHUR	All right!  What do you want?
TALL KNIGHT	We want ... a shrubbery!
ARTHUR	A what?
TALL KNIGHT	Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!

ARTHUR	All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
TALL KNIGHT	You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
ARTHUR	Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
TALL KNIGHT	One that looks nice.
ARTHUR	Of course.
TALL KNIGHT	And not too expensive.
ARTHUR	Yes ...
TALL KNIGHT	Now - go!

ARTHUR	Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
TALL KNIGHT	That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
ARTHUR	What is that?
TALL KNIGHT	We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!

ARTHUR	We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
TALL KNIGHT	Oh, please!
ARTHUR	Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!

ARTHUR	What word?
TALL KNIGHT	I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
ARTHUR	How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
TALL KNIGHT	You said it again!
ARTHUR	What, "is"?
TALL KNIGHT	No, no ... not "is"!

BLACK KNIGHT	None shall pass.
ARTHUR	What?
BLACK KNIGHT	None shall pass.
ARTHUR	I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
BLACK KNIGHT	Then you shall die.
ARTHUR	I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
BLACK KNIGHT	I move for no man.
ARTHUR	So be it!

ARTHUR	Now stand aside worthy adversary.
BLACK KNIGHT	'Tis but a scratch.
ARTHUR	A scratch?  Your arm's off.
BLACK KNIGHT	No, it isn't.
ARTHUR	Well, what's that then?
BLACK KNIGHT	I've had worse.
ARTHUR	You're a liar.
BLACK KNIGHT	Come on you pansy!

ARTHUR	Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
BLACK KNIGHT	Come on then.
ARTHUR	What?

ARTHUR	You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
BLACK KNIGHT	Had enough?
ARTHUR	You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
BLACK KNIGHT	Course I have.
ARTHUR	Look!
BLACK KNIGHT	What!  Just a flesh wound. 
ARTHUR	Stop that.
BLACK KNIGHT	Had enough ... ?
ARTHUR	I'll have your leg.

BLACK KNIGHT	I'll do you for that.
ARTHUR	You'll what ... ?
BLACK KNIGHT	Come Here.
ARTHUR	What are you going to do. bleed on me?
BLACK KNIGHT	I'm invincible!
ARTHUR	You're a looney.
BLACK KNIGHT	The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!

BLACK KNIGHT	All right, we'll call it a draw.
ARTHUR	Come, Patsy.

ARTHUR	Hello.
MAN	'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
ARTHUR	I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
MAN	This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
ARTHUR	Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
MAN	Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
ARTHUR	What?

ARTHUR	Are you sure he's got one?
MAN	Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
ARTHUR	Well ... can we come up and have a look?
MAN	Of course not!  You are English pigs.
ARTHUR	Well, what are you then?
MAN	I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.

BEDEVERE	Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
ARTHUR	I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
BEDEVERE	My liege ... forgive me ...

ARTHUR	Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
BEDEVERE	My liege,  I am honored.

ARTHUR	What is your name?
BEDEVERE	Bedevere, my Liege.
ARTHUR	Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!

BEDEVERE	And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
ARTHUR	This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
BEDEVERE	OF course, my Liege ...

ARTHUR	Now what happens?
BEDEVERE	Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
ARTHUR	Who ... Who breaks out?
BEDEVERE	Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...

ARTHUR	Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
BEDEVERE	No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!

BEDEVERE	Nu!
ARTHUR	No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
BEDEVERE	Ni, ni, ni!
ARTHUR	|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
BEDEVERE	Ni!
ARTHUR	That's it.  Ni!  Ni!

BEDEVERE	Ni!
ARTHUR	No.  No.  No!

BEDEVERE	They're nervous, sire.
ARTHUR	Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.

BEDEVERE	What with?
ARTHUR	Just keep me covered.

ARTHUR	There!  Look!
BEDEVERE	What does it say?

ARTHUR	What?
BEDEVERE	It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...

ARTHUR	What?
BEDEVERE	It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand |      well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              HECTOR |      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              ROBIN |      Look out. | |  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.  The KNIGHTS retreat |  into the darkness of the cave. | |                              GAWAIN |           |      It's only a cartoon. | |                              ARTHUR |      Sh!

ARTHUR	We shall attack at once.
BEDEVERE	Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!

ARTHUR	Who are they?
BEDEVERE	Oh, just some friends!

ARTHUR	What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
TIM	I am an enchanter.

ARTHUR	By what name are you known?
TIM	There are some who call me Tim?
ARTHUR	Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
TIM	Greetings King Arthur.
ARTHUR	You know my name?
TIM	I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
ARTHUR	That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
TIM	Quite.

TIM	What?
ARTHUR	A G...g...g...
TIM	A Grail?

ARTHUR	Look, you're a busy man ...
TIM	Yes, I can help you with your guest.

TIM	... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
ARTHUR	How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
TIM	Follow!

TIM	Too late.
ARTHUR	What?
TIM	There he is!

ARTHUR	Where?
TIM	There.
ARTHUR	Behind the rabbit?
TIM	It is the rabbit.
ARTHUR	... You silly sod.
TIM	What?
ARTHUR	You got us all worked up.

ARTHUR	Je...sus Christ!
TIM	I warned you!

ARTHUR	Oh, shut up.
TIM	It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
ARTHUR	Charge!

TIM	Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
ARTHUR	Who did we lose?

ARTHUR	Old woman!
DENNIS	Man!
ARTHUR	Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
DENNIS	I'm thirty-seven.
ARTHUR	What?

DENNIS	:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
ARTHUR	:Well - I can't just say:  "Hey, Man!'

DENNIS	Well you could say: "Dennis"
ARTHUR	I didn't know you were called Dennis.
DENNIS	You didn't bother to find out, did you?
ARTHUR	I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
DENNIS	What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
ARTHUR	Well ... I AM king.
DENNIS	Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...

DENNIS	I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
ARTHUR	Yes.
DENNIS	... But all the decision of that officer ...
ARTHUR	Yes, I see.
DENNIS	... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
ARTHUR	Be quiet!
DENNIS	... but a two-thirds majority ...
ARTHUR	Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.

DENNIS	You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
ARTHUR	Shut up!
DENNIS	I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
ARTHUR	Shut up, will you. Shut up!
DENNIS	Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
ARTHUR	Shut up!

DENNIS	Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
ARTHUR	Bloody peasant! 
DENNIS	Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
ARTHUR	Come on, patsy.

ARTHUR	Sorry ...
GOD	And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
ARTHUR	I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
GOD	Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
ARTHUR	Yes, Lord.
GOD	Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
ARTHUR	Good idea, O Lord!
GOD	Course it's a good idea.

BEDEVERE	Well?
FIRST VILLAGER	... Well, we did do the nose.
BEDEVERE	The nose?
FIRST VILLAGER	And the hat.  But she is a witch.

FIRST VILLAGER	... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
BEDEVERE	Why do you think she is a witch?

FIRST VILLAGER	Make a bridge out of her.
BEDEVERE	Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?

BEDEVERE	Exactly.  So... logically ...
FIRST VILLAGER	If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
BEDEVERE	And therefore?

LARGE MAN	Nothing... There's your ninepence.
BODY	I'm not dead!

LARGE MAN	He will be soon. He's very ill.
BODY	I'm getting better!
LARGE MAN	You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.

BODY	I feel fine.
LARGE MAN	Do me a favour.

BODY	I think I'll go for a walk.
LARGE MAN	You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
BODY	I feel happy... I feel happy.

BRIDGEKEEPER	Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
LAUNCELOT	Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
BRIDGEKEEPER	What is your name?
LAUNCELOT	My name is Sir Launcelot.
BRIDGEKEEPER	What is your quest?
LAUNCELOT	To find the Holy Grail.
BRIDGEKEEPER	What is your favorite colour?
LAUNCELOT	Blue.
BRIDGEKEEPER	Right.  Off you go.

ROBIN	That's easy!
BRIDGEKEEPER	Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
ROBIN	Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
BRIDGEKEEPER	What is your name?
ROBIN	My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
BRIDGEKEEPER	What is your quest?
ROBIN	To seek the Grail!
BRIDGEKEEPER	What is the capital of Assyria?
ROBIN	I don't know that!

CART DRIVER	Bring out your dead!
LARGE MAN	Here's one!
CART DRIVER	Ninepence.

CART DRIVER	'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
LARGE MAN	Yes he is.

LARGE MAN	Don't be such a baby.
CART DRIVER	I can't take him.

CART DRIVER	I can't.
LARGE MAN	Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
CART DRIVER	I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
LARGE MAN	When's your next round?
CART DRIVER	Thursday.

LARGE MAN	Thanks very much.
CART DRIVER	That's all right.  See you on Thursday.

LARGE MAN	Who's that then?
CART DRIVER	I dunno, Must be a king.
LARGE MAN	Why?
CART DRIVER	He hasn't got shit all over him.

LAUNCELOT	Well taken, Concorde!
CONCORDE	Thank you, sir, most kind ...
LAUNCELOT	And another!

LAUNCELOT	At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
CONCORDE	I'm not quite dead, sir ...
LAUNCELOT	Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
CONCORDE	I think I could pull through, sir.
LAUNCELOT	Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.

CONCORDE	I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
LAUNCELOT	I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
CONCORDE	Really, I feel fine, sir.
LAUNCELOT	Farewell, Concorde!
CONCORDE	It just seems silly ... me lying here.

FATHER	Did you kill all those guards?
LAUNCELOT	Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
FATHER	They cost fifty pounds each!
LAUNCELOT	Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...

FATHER	You killed eight wedding guests in all!
LAUNCELOT	Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
FATHER	I can understand that.

LAUNCELOT	Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
FATHER	Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
LAUNCELOT	Gosh - Is he all right?
FATHER	You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
LAUNCELOT	I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
FATHER	Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?

FATHER	'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
LAUNCELOT	Is it?

FATHER	Do you want to come and have a drink?
LAUNCELOT	Oh ... that's awfully nice.

LAUNCELOT	It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
FATHER	Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?

FATHER	One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
PRINCE	What - the curtains?
FATHER	No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
PRINCE	But, Mother ...
FATHER	Father, lad.
PRINCE	But, Father, I don't really want any of that.
FATHER	Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
PRINCE	But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
FATHER	Rather what?
PRINCE	I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
FATHER	You're not going to do a song while I'm here!

PRINCE	I don't want land.
FATHER	Listen, Alice ...
PRINCE	Herbert.
FATHER	Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
PRINCE	But I don't like her.
FATHER	Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
PRINCE	I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...

PRINCE	But, Father.
FATHER	Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!

FATHER	Who are you?
PRINCE	I'm ... your son ...
FATHER	Not you.

PRINCE	Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
FATHER	Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -

FATHER	You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
PRINCE	I was saved at the last minute.
FATHER	How?
PRINCE	Well ... I'll tell you ...

FATHER	Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
FIRST GUARD	Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
FATHER	No.  Until I come and get him.

FATHER	No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
FIRST GUARD	... and you'll come and get him.

FIRST GUARD	We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
FATHER	Leaving the room.
FIRST GUARD	Leaving the room ... yes.
FATHER	Got it?

FIRST GUARD	Er ... if ... we ... er ...
FATHER	Yes?
FIRST GUARD	If we ... er ... 
FATHER	Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.

FIRST GUARD	Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
FATHER	No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
FIRST GUARD	Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
FATHER	No ... just keep him in here.
FIRST GUARD	Until you, or anyone else ...
FATHER	No, not anyone else - just me.
FIRST GUARD	Just you ...

FATHER	Right.
FIRST GUARD	Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
FATHER	And make sure he doesn't leave.
FIRST GUARD	What?
FATHER	Make sure he doesn't leave.
FIRST GUARD	The Prince ... ?
FATHER	Yes ...  make sure ...
FIRST GUARD	Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
FATHER	Is that clear?

FATHER	Where are you going?
FIRST GUARD	We're coming with you.
FATHER	No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
FIRST GUARD	Oh, I see,  Right.

GALAHAD	The Castle Anthrax?
ZOOT	Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
GALAHAD	Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
ZOOT	The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!

GALAHAD	Well, look er, I ...
ZOOT	What is your name, handsome knight?
GALAHAD	Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
ZOOT	Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.

GALAHAD	Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...
ZOOT	Sir Galahad!!

GALAHAD	Well ...
ZOOT	I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....

ZOOT	We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
GALAHAD	No, It's nothing!
ZOOT	You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.

GALAHAD	Camelot ...
LAUNCELOT	Camelot ...

LAUNCELOT	Sir Galahad!
GALAHAD	Oh ... hello ...
LAUNCELOT	Quick!
GALAHAD	Why?
LAUNCELOT	You are in great peril.

GALAHAD	Well, she's got a point.
LAUNCELOT	We'll cover your escape!
GALAHAD	Look - I'm fine!

LAUNCELOT	Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
GALAHAD	No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!

LAUNCELOT	We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
GALAHAD	I don't think I was.
LAUNCELOT	You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
GALAHAD	Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
LAUNCELOT	It's too perilous.

GALAHAD	Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
LAUNCELOT	No, no, we must find the Grail.

GALAHAD	Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
LAUNCELOT	No.  It's unhealthy.
GALAHAD	... I Bet you're gay.
LAUNCELOT	No, I'm not.

LAUNCELOT	Sir Gawain.
GALAHAD	Ector.

PIGLET	Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
GALAHAD	They're doctors?

GALAHAD	No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
PIGLET	We must examine you.
GALAHAD	There's nothing wrong with ... that.
PIGLET	Please ... we are doctors.

GALAHAD	No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
PIGLET	Back to your bed!  At once!
GALAHAD	I'm sorry, I must go.

LAUNCELOT	Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
PRINCE	You got my note!
LAUNCELOT	Well ... yes ...
PRINCE	You've come to rescue me?
LAUNCELOT	Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
PRINCE	I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...

LAUNCELOT	I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
PRINCE	He's come to rescue me, father.
LAUNCELOT	Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...

PRINCE	Hurry!
LAUNCELOT	I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.

TALL KNIGHT	When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
OTHER KNIGHTS	A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!

TALL KNIGHT	When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
OTHER KNIGHTS	Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!

OTHER KNIGHTS	Oh!
TALL KNIGHT	Don't say that word.

TALL KNIGHT	Stop saying the word!
OTHER KNIGHTS	Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...

OTHER KNIGHTS	They're all saying the word ...
TALL KNIGHT	Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
OTHER KNIGHTS	You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.

ROBIN	You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
TIM	That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!

ROBIN	|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
TIM	Look.  I'm warning you.
ROBIN	What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
TIM	Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.

ROBIN	I done it again.
TIM	Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.

ROBIN	Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
SINGERS	Brave, Sir Rob ...
ROBIN	Shut up.

SINGERS	He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
ROBIN	Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.

SINGERS	Brave Sir Robin ran away.
ROBIN	I didn't.
SINGERS	Bravely ran away, away.
ROBIN	No, no, no.
SINGERS	When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.

ALBINO	Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
WESTLEY	Then I'm here till I die?
ALBINO	Till they kill you. Yeah.
WESTLEY	Then why bother curing me?
ALBINO	The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
WESTLEY	So it's to be torture.

WESTLEY	You don't believe me?
ALBINO	You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.

BUTTERCUP	If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
HUMPERDINCK	May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
BUTTERCUP	He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
HUMPERDINCK	I swear it will be done.

BUTTERCUP	My Westley will always come for me.
HUMPERDINCK	I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?

BUTTERCUP	He will come for me.
HUMPERDINCK	Of course.

HUMPERDINCK	Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
BUTTERCUP	Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.

BUTTERCUP	Every ship but the four you sent.
HUMPERDINCK	Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.

BUTTERCUP	You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
HUMPERDINCK	You're a silly girl.
BUTTERCUP	Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
HUMPERDINCK	I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
BUTTERCUP	Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.

HUMPERDINCK	You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
BUTTERCUP	Should I be?
HUMPERDINCK	Brides often are, I'm told.
BUTTERCUP	I do not marry tonight.

HUMPERDINCK	I killed him myself.
BUTTERCUP	Then why is there fear behind your eyes?

BUTTERCUP	Who are you?
MAN IN BLACK	I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.

BUTTERCUP	To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
MAN IN BLACK	They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.

MAN IN BLACK	Catch your breath.
BUTTERCUP	If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
MAN IN BLACK	And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
BUTTERCUP	I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
MAN IN BLACK	You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.

BUTTERCUP	I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
MAN IN BLACK	You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
BUTTERCUP	He knows I do not love him.
MAN IN BLACK	Are not capable of love is what you mean.
BUTTERCUP	I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.

MAN IN BLACK	Rest, Highness.
BUTTERCUP	I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.

BUTTERCUP	You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
MAN IN BLACK	With pride. What can I do for you?
BUTTERCUP	You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
MAN IN BLACK	Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?

BUTTERCUP	On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
MAN IN BLACK	I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
BUTTERCUP	You mock my pain!
MAN IN BLACK	Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?

MAN IN BLACK	Does it bother you to hear?
BUTTERCUP	Nothing you can say will upset me.
MAN IN BLACK	He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.

MAN IN BLACK	I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
BUTTERCUP	And what am I?
MAN IN BLACK	Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
BUTTERCUP	You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!

MAN IN BLACK	... as ... you ... wish...
BUTTERCUP	Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?

BUTTERCUP	Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
WESTLEY	As you wish.

BUTTERCUP	Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
WESTLEY	As you wish.

BUTTERCUP	I fear I'll never see you again.
WESTLEY	Of course you will.
BUTTERCUP	But what if something happens to you?
WESTLEY	Hear this now: I will come for you.
BUTTERCUP	But how can you be sure?
WESTLEY	This is true love. You think this happens every day?

WESTLEY	Can you move at all?
BUTTERCUP	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
WESTLEY	I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
BUTTERCUP	Well ... you were dead.
WESTLEY	Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
BUTTERCUP	I will never doubt again.
WESTLEY	There will never be a need.

BUTTERCUP	We'll never survive.
WESTLEY	Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.

WESTLEY	Singed a bit, were you?
BUTTERCUP	You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.

WESTLEY	This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
BUTTERCUP	But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
WESTLEY	I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.

WESTLEY	Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
BUTTERCUP	What? -- go on --

BUTTERCUP	We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
WESTLEY	No. No. We have already succeeded.

WESTLEY	I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
BUTTERCUP	Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
WESTLEY	Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...

BUTTERCUP	We did it.
WESTLEY	Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.

BUTTERCUP	Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
WESTLEY	Gently.
BUTTERCUP	At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
WESTLEY	Gently!!

BUTTERCUP	Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
WESTLEY	What hideous sin have you committed lately?
BUTTERCUP	I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
WESTLEY	It never happened.
BUTTERCUP	What?
WESTLEY	It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.

BUTTERCUP	But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
WESTLEY	Did you say, "I do"?
BUTTERCUP	Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
WESTLEY	Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?

FEZZIK	I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
MAN IN BLACK	I believe you -- So what happens now?
FEZZIK	We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
MAN IN BLACK	You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
FEZZIK	I could kill you now.

MAN IN BLACK	Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
FEZZIK	It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.

MAN IN BLACK	Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
FEZZIK	I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.

FEZZIK	You're quick.
MAN IN BLACK	And a good thing too.
FEZZIK	Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.

MAN IN BLACK	Why is that, do you think?
FEZZIK	Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.

MAN IN BLACK	Why should that make such a difference?
FEZZIK	Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.

VIZZINI	It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
FEZZIK	Who's Guilder?
VIZZINI	The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!

VIZZINI	Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
FEZZIK	You never said anything about killing anyone.

VIZZINI	I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
FEZZIK	I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
VIZZINI	Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.

VIZZINI	No more rhymes now, I mean it.
FEZZIK	Anybody want a peanut?

FEZZIK	I only dog paddle.
VIZZINI	Veer left. Left. Left!

VIZZINI	Faster!
FEZZIK	I thought I was going faster.
VIZZINI	You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
FEZZIK	Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
VIZZINI	-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
FEZZIK	Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

FEZZIK	You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
VIZZINI	I'm waiting!

VIZZINI	Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
FEZZIK	What do I do?
VIZZINI	Finish him, finish him. Your way.
FEZZIK	Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?

INIGO	Probably he means no harm.
FEZZIK	He's really very short on charm.
INIGO	Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
FEZZIK	Yes, some of the time. 

INIGO	FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
FEZZIK	If there are, we'll all be dead.

FEZZIK	Hello.
INIGO	It's you.
FEZZIK	True!

FEZZIK	You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
INIGO	Perhaps not. I feel fine.
FEZZIK	Yeah?

FEZZIK	He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
INIGO	How many could you handle?
FEZZIK	I don't think more than ten.
INIGO	That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.

INIGO	No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
FEZZIK	-- what? --
INIGO	-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
FEZZIK	-- where?
INIGO	To find the Man in Black, obviously.
FEZZIK	But you don't know where he is.
INIGO	Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.

FEZZIK	The Man in Black?
INIGO	His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --

INIGO	-- Fezzik, please --
FEZZIK	Everybody ... MOVE!!

INIGO	Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
FEZZIK	The body?
INIGO	Have you any money?
FEZZIK	I have a little.
INIGO	I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.

FEZZIK	Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
INIGO	What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
FEZZIK	Has it been fifteen minutes?
INIGO	We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.

INIGO	Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
FEZZIK	How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?

FEZZIK	You've been mostly dead all day.
INIGO	We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.

INIGO	Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
FEZZIK	Over the Albino, I think.

FEZZIK	Will this do?
INIGO	Where did you get that?
FEZZIK	At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.

FEZZIK	Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
INIGO	Right, right, sorry.

FEZZIK	Inigo.
INIGO	What?
FEZZIK	I hope we win...

INIGO	He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
FEZZIK	I'll be right back.

GRANDFATHER	I brought you a special present.
THE KID	What is it?
GRANDFATHER	Open it up.

THE KID	A book?
GRANDFATHER	That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
THE KID	Has it got any sports in it?

THE KID	It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
GRANDFATHER	Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.

GRANDFATHER	Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
THE KID	Yeah. It's really good.
GRANDFATHER	Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.

THE KID	-hold it, hold it-
THE KID	What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
GRANDFATHER	-- wait, just wait --
THE KID	-- well, when does it get good?
GRANDFATHER	Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.

GRANDFATHER	It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
THE KID	I don't be-leeve this.

GRANDFATHER	Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
THE KID	-- murdered by pirates is good --

THE KID	What?
GRANDFATHER	The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
THE KID	Well, I wasn't nervous.

THE KID	Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
GRANDFATHER	Because I can stop now if you want.
THE KID	No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.

THE KID	Oh no. No, please.
GRANDFATHER	What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.

THE KID	They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
GRANDFATHER	Someday, you may not mind so much.
THE KID	Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
GRANDFATHER	Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.

THE KID	You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
GRANDFATHER	Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
THE KID	I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
GRANDFATHER	Do you want me to go on with this?
THE KID	Yes.
GRANDFATHER	All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.

GRANDFATHER	It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
THE KID	See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
GRANDFATHER	-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

THE KID	Westley's only faking, right?
GRANDFATHER	You want me to read this or not?
THE KID	Who gets Humperdinck?
GRANDFATHER	I don't understand.
THE KID	Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
GRANDFATHER	Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.

THE KID	No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
GRANDFATHER	Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.

THE KID	What? What?
GRANDFATHER	No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
THE KID	I don't mind so much.

GRANDFATHER	Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
THE KID	Okay.
GRANDFATHER	Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.

THE KID	Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
GRANDFATHER	As you wish...

HUMPERDINCK	Yellin.
YELLIN	Sire.
HUMPERDINCK	As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
YELLIN	My spy network has heard no such news.

HUMPERDINCK	She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
YELLIN	Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
HUMPERDINCK	Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
YELLIN	It won't be easy, Sire.
HUMPERDINCK	Try ruling the world sometime.

HUMPERDINCK	Rise and report.
YELLIN	The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
HUMPERDINCK	Double it. My Princess must be safe.
YELLIN	The gate has but one key, and I carry that.

WESTLEY	You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
HUMPERDINCK	I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
WESTLEY	Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
HUMPERDINCK	I tell you once again -- surrender!
WESTLEY	It will not happen!

HUMPERDINCK	For the last time -- SURRENDER!
WESTLEY	DEATH FIRST!!

HUMPERDINCK	A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
WESTLEY	No.  To the pain.
HUMPERDINCK	I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
WESTLEY	I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
HUMPERDINCK	That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.

HUMPERDINCK	-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
WESTLEY	I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
HUMPERDINCK	-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
WESTLEY	Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --

HUMPERDINCK	There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
RUGEN	Who won? How did it end?
HUMPERDINCK	The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
RUGEN	Shall we track them both?
HUMPERDINCK	The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.

RUGEN	Could this be a trap?
HUMPERDINCK	I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.

HUMPERDINCK	Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
RUGEN	I swear it will be done.

HUMPERDINCK	She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
RUGEN	Of course.

HUMPERDINCK	I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
RUGEN	Yes.
HUMPERDINCK	Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.

RUGEN	Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
HUMPERDINCK	Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.

RUGEN	Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
HUMPERDINCK	Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.

INIGO	Your guess is as good as mine --
WESTLEY	I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.

WESTLEY	Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
INIGO	Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.

INIGO	Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
WESTLEY	That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.

INIGO	And it is guarded by sixty men.
WESTLEY	And our assets?
INIGO	Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.

WESTLEY	Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
INIGO	There we cannot help you.

INIGO	Why? You can't even lift one.
WESTLEY	True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
INIGO	I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --

INIGO	Now?
WESTLEY	Not yet.

INIGO	Now?
WESTLEY	Light him.

INIGO	Where's Fezzik?
WESTLEY	I thought he was with you.
INIGO	No.
WESTLEY	In that case --

INIGO	You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
WESTLEY	Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.

INIGO	Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
RUGEN	Stop saying that!

RUGEN	No --
INIGO	-- offer me money --

RUGEN	-- yes --
INIGO	-- power too -- promise me that --

RUGEN	-- all that I have and more please --
INIGO	-- offer me everything I ask for --
RUGEN	-- anything you want --
INIGO	I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!

MIRACLE MAX	What? What?
INIGO	Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
MIRACLE MAX	The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!

MIRACLE MAX	Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
INIGO	He's already dead.
MIRACLE MAX	He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.

INIGO	Sir. Sir.
MIRACLE MAX	Hah?
INIGO	We're really in a terrible rush.
MIRACLE MAX	Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
INIGO	Sixty-five.
MIRACLE MAX	Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.

INIGO	This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
MIRACLE MAX	Are you a rotten liar.
INIGO	I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
MIRACLE MAX	Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.

INIGO	He's dead. He can't talk.
MIRACLE MAX	Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.

MIRACLE MAX	Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
INIGO	What's that?

INIGO	True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
MIRACLE MAX	Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated

INIGO	Humiliations galore!
MIRACLE MAX	That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

INIGO	Thank you for everything.
MIRACLE MAX	Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.

INIGO	Slow going?
MAN IN BLACK	Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
INIGO	Sorry.
MAN IN BLACK	Thank you.

INIGO	I do not suppose you could speed things up?
MAN IN BLACK	If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.

INIGO	I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
MAN IN BLACK	That does put a damper on our relationship.

INIGO	But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
MAN IN BLACK	That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
INIGO	I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
MAN IN BLACK	No good. I've known too many Spaniards.

INIGO	You don't know any way you'll trust me?
MAN IN BLACK	Nothing comes to mind.

INIGO	We'll wait until you're ready.
MAN IN BLACK	Again. Thank you.

MAN IN BLACK	Do you always begin conversations this way?
INIGO	My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.

MAN IN BLACK	How old were you?
INIGO	I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
MAN IN BLACK	You've done nothing but study swordplay?
INIGO	More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
MAN IN BLACK	Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
INIGO	You are ready, then?
MAN IN BLACK	Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.

INIGO	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
MAN IN BLACK	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
INIGO	Begin!

MAN IN BLACK	I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
INIGO	Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.

INIGO	You are wonderful!
MAN IN BLACK	Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.

INIGO	I admit it -- you are better than I am.
MAN IN BLACK	Then why are you smiling?

INIGO	Because I know something you don't know.
MAN IN BLACK	And what is that?
INIGO	I am not left-handed.

MAN IN BLACK	You're amazing!
INIGO	I ought to be after twenty years.

MAN IN BLACK	There's something I ought to tell you.
INIGO	Tell me.
MAN IN BLACK	I am not left-handed either.

INIGO	Who are you?!
MAN IN BLACK	No one of consequence.
INIGO	I must know.
MAN IN BLACK	Get used to disappointment.
INIGO	Okay.

INIGO	Kill me quickly.
MAN IN BLACK	I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --

INIGO	Making sure nobody's following us.
VIZZINI	That would be inconceivable.

VIZZINI	Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
INIGO	You're sure nobody's following us?
VIZZINI	As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
INIGO	No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
VIZZINI	What?

VIZZINI	Go in, get after her!
INIGO	I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.

INIGO	Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
VIZZINI	Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.

INIGO	He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
VIZZINI	Inconceivable!

VIZZINI	He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
INIGO	You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.

INIGO	I want to duel him left-handed.
VIZZINI	You know what a hurry we're in.
INIGO	Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
VIZZINI	Oh, have it your way.

MAN IN BLACK	Let me explain-
VIZZINI	-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.

MAN IN BLACK	Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
VIZZINI	There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!

MAN IN BLACK	But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
VIZZINI	I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
MAN IN BLACK	You're that smart?
VIZZINI	Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
MAN IN BLACK	Yes.
VIZZINI	Morons.
MAN IN BLACK	Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
VIZZINI	For the Princess?

VIZZINI	I accept.
MAN IN BLACK	Good. Then pour the wine.

MAN IN BLACK	Inhale this, but do not touch.
VIZZINI	I smell nothing.
MAN IN BLACK	What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
VIZZINI	Hmm.

VIZZINI	Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
MAN IN BLACK	You've made your decision then7
VIZZINI	Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
MAN IN BLACK	Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
VIZZINI	Wait till I get going! Where was I?
MAN IN BLACK	Australia.
VIZZINI	Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.

MAN IN BLACK	You're just stalling now.
VIZZINI	You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

MAN IN BLACK	You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
VIZZINI	It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
MAN IN BLACK	Then make your choice.
VIZZINI	I will. And I choose --

MAN IN BLACK	What's so funny?
VIZZINI	I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.

MAN IN BLACK	You guessed wrong.
VIZZINI	You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.

MIRACLE MAX	-- get back, witch --
VALERIE	I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
MIRACLE MAX	You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.

VALERIE	True love. He said, "true love," Max. My God --
MIRACLE MAX	Don't say another word, Valerie.
VALERIE	He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
MIRACLE MAX	Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
VALERIE	What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
MIRACLE MAX	I'm not listening.
VALERIE	A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
MIRACLE MAX	Nobody's hearing nothing!
VALERIE	Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!

VALERIE	The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
MIRACLE MAX	An hour.
VALERIE	Yeah, an hour.
MIRACLE MAX	A good hour. Yeah.

VALERIE	Bye-bye, boys.
MIRACLE MAX	Have fun storming the castle.
VALERIE	Think it'll work?
MIRACLE MAX	It would take a miracle. Bye!
VALERIE	Bye.

MOTHER	You feeling any better?
THE KID	A little bit.
MOTHER	Guess what.
THE KID	What?
MOTHER	Your grandfather's here.
THE KID	Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?
MOTHER	You are sick, that's why he's here.
THE KID	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
MOTHER	Maybe he won't.

DE BRIS	How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
BIALYSTOCK	Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
DE BRIS	Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
BIALYSTOCK	I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
DE BRIS	Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
BIALYSTOCK	That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.

DE BRIS	Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
BIALYSTOCK	Congratulations.
DE BRIS	Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.

BIALYSTOCK	Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
DE BRIS	What are you saying?
BIALYSTOCK	Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?

BIALYSTOCK	Of the silvery moon,
L452855	u7161	m481	BLOOM AND DRUNK	By the light, by the light,
BIALYSTOCK	I want to croon,
L452857	u7161	m481	BLOOM AND DRUNK	Of the silvery mooooon,
BIALYSTOCK	To my honey I'll croon,
L452859	u7161	m481	BLOOM AND DRUNK	He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
BIALYSTOCK	Honeymoon,
L452861	u7161	m481	BLOOM AND DRUNK	He's gonna croon love's tune,
BIALYSTOCK	Keep a shining in...
L452863	u7161	m481	BLOOM AND DRUNK	Honeymoon, honeymoon,

BIALYSTOCK	Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
BLOOM	How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
BIALYSTOCK	You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
BLOOM	I'll wait in the hall ...
BIALYSTOCK	Oooooooops!
BLOOM	Ooooooops.

BLOOM	Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
BIALYSTOCK	Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
BLOOM	Scared.  Can't talk.

BIALYSTOCK	All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
BLOOM	I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 

BLOOM	Yes sir.
BIALYSTOCK	Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?

BLOOM	But sir, I'm not condem ...
BIALYSTOCK	Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.

BIALYSTOCK	You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
BIALYSTOCK	Do the books!  Do the books!
BLOOM	Yes, sir.  Thank you.
BIALYSTOCK	Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.

BIALYSTOCK	Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
BLOOM	Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...

BIALYSTOCK	I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
BIALYSTOCK	I have hurt your feelings.
BIALYSTOCK	Good, what is it?
BLOOM	Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
BIALYSTOCK	Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
BLOOM	Well, sir, it seems ...
BIALYSTOCK	You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
BLOOM	In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
BIALYSTOCK	Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.

BIALYSTOCK	What is that?  A handkerchief?
BLOOM	It's nothing ... nothing.

BIALYSTOCK	Here, don't panic.
BLOOM	I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
BIALYSTOCK	They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
BLOOM	Mr. Bialystock ...
BIALYSTOCK	Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?

BLOOM	This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
BIALYSTOCK	Where?  What?
BLOOM	According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
BIALYSTOCK	I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
BLOOM	It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
BIALYSTOCK	Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
BLOOM	But that's cheating!
BIALYSTOCK	It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!

BIALYSTOCK	Help!
BLOOM	All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
BIALYSTOCK	Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
BLOOM	Oh, it's all right ... wha?
BIALYSTOCK	Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
BLOOM	Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
BIALYSTOCK	Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
BLOOM	Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...

BLOOM	Yes, what?
BIALYSTOCK	What you were saying.  Keep talking.
BLOOM	What was I saying?
BIALYSTOCK	You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
BLOOM	Yes, it's quite possible.
BIALYSTOCK	You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?

BIALYSTOCK	Assume away!
BLOOM	Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
BIALYSTOCK	What do you mean?
BLOOM	You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
BIALYSTOCK	What did I do?
BLOOM	You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
BIALYSTOCK	So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
BLOOM	Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
BIALYSTOCK	But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
BLOOM	Exactly.  And how long did it run?
BIALYSTOCK	One night.

BLOOM	See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
BIALYSTOCK	But what if the play was a hit?
BLOOM	Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
BIALYSTOCK	Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
BLOOM	What scheme?
BIALYSTOCK	What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
BLOOM	Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
BIALYSTOCK	Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!

BLOOM	Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
BIALYSTOCK	No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
BLOOM	Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.

BLOOM	Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
BIALYSTOCK	You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
BLOOM	You're going to jump on me.
BLOOM	You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
BIALYSTOCK	What???
BLOOM	Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
BIALYSTOCK	I'm not going to jump on you!
BLOOM	Aaaaaaaaaa!

BIALYSTOCK	Will you get a hold on yourself.
BLOOM	Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
BIALYSTOCK	What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
BLOOM	I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.

BIALYSTOCK	What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
BLOOM	Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.

BIALYSTOCK	Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
BLOOM	It's a little better, but you still look angry.
BIALYSTOCK	How's this? 

BLOOM	Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
BIALYSTOCK	Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
BLOOM	Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
BIALYSTOCK	They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
BLOOM	That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...

BLOOM	I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
BIALYSTOCK	Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
BLOOM	Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
BIALYSTOCK	I already have.  Come on.
BLOOM	Oh.

BIALYSTOCK	Where would you like to eat?
BLOOM	Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
BIALYSTOCK	Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
BLOOM	Coney Island??
BIALYSTOCK	What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
BLOOM	I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
BIALYSTOCK	Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
BLOOM	Right.
BIALYSTOCK	Then stick with Bialystock!

BIALYSTOCK	What kind now, Leo?
BLOOM	I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
BIALYSTOCK	Two pistachios, my good man.

BIALYSTOCK	Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
BLOOM	I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
BIALYSTOCK	Maybe you're happy.
BLOOM	Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.

BIALYSTOCK	You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
BLOOM	You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!

BIALYSTOCK	You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
BLOOM	I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
BIALYSTOCK	This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!

BIALYSTOCK	You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
BLOOM	Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
BIALYSTOCK	I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
BLOOM	You found a flop!
BIALYSTOCK	A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!

BLOOM	It won't run a week!
BIALYSTOCK	Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
BLOOM	Who wrote it?

BLOOM	Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
BIALYSTOCK	Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.

BIALYSTOCK	There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
BLOOM	Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
BIALYSTOCK	Okay, take it off, take it off.

BLOOM	Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
BLOOM	Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
BLOOM	Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
BIALYSTOCK	Leo, what if this play is a hit?
BLOOM	Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
BIALYSTOCK	OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.

BLOOM	What are you doing?
BIALYSTOCK	I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.

BLOOM	How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
BIALYSTOCK	They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
BLOOM	What is she gonna do here?
BIALYSTOCK	I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.

BLOOM	Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
BIALYSTOCK	Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
BLOOM	But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
BIALYSTOCK	Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
BLOOM	Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
BIALYSTOCK	Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
BLOOM	Do you think he'll take the job?
BIALYSTOCK	Only if we ask him.

BLOOM	Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
BIALYSTOCK	It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.

BIALYSTOCK	So much for Nutsy Fagin.
BLOOM	Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
BIALYSTOCK	Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.

BIALYSTOCK	To failure!
BLOOM	To failure!

BIALYSTOCK	Maybe it's not true!
BLOOM	No way out.  No way out.
BIALYSTOCK	Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
BLOOM	No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
BIALYSTOCK	Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
BLOOM	The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.

BIALYSTOCK	What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
BLOOM	I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.

BIALYSTOCK	I never should have listened to you.
BLOOM	Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
BIALYSTOCK	Double.  Double.  Double.

BIALYSTOCK	Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
BLOOM	What???
BIALYSTOCK	Shut up.

BIALYSTOCK	They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
BLOOM	Liebkind, no!
BIALYSTOCK	What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?

BLOOM	Max, I...
BIALYSTOCK	What is it?

BLOOM	Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
BIALYSTOCK	Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.

BIALYSTOCK	Don't help me.
BLOOM	He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 

LIEBKIND	I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
BIALYSTOCK	Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
LIEBKIND	I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
L452456	u7158	m481	BIALYSTOCK	Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
L452455	u7165	m481	LIEBKIND	Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
BIALYSTOCK	Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
LIEBKIND	My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
BIALYSTOCK	Yes.
LIEBKIND	Vat about it?
BIALYSTOCK	We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
LIEBKIND	You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?

LIEBKIND	I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
BIALYSTOCK	With whom?

LIEBKIND	Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
BIALYSTOCK	No kidding?
LIEBKIND	Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
BIALYSTOCK	Really, I never dreamed ...
LIEBKIND	That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
BIALYSTOCK	That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 

LIEBKIND	Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
BIALYSTOCK	We swear it!
LIEBKIND	Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
BIALYSTOCK	Yes.  We would!
LIEBKIND	Good.  I will make the preparations.

BIALYSTOCK	You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
LIEBKIND	It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.

LIEBKIND	Vaaaat???
BIALYSTOCK	Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
LIEBKIND	But he has long hair!
BIALYSTOCK	Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
LIEBKIND	I don't know.  I don't know.

BIALYSTOCK	Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
LIEBKIND	All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.

BIALYSTOCK	Not.
LIEBKIND	Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!

BIALYSTOCK	Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
LIEBKIND	I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.

LIEBKIND	Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
BIALYSTOCK	You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
LIEBKIND	Always.
BIALYSTOCK	Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
LIEBKIND	It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...

LIEBKIND	Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
BIALYSTOCK	You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.

LIEBKIND	Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
BIALYSTOCK	Come on.  Let's get going.
LIEBKIND	Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.

LIEBKIND	Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
BIALYSTOCK	You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
LIEBKIND	Yes.  Amazing isn't it?

LIEBKIND	Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
BIALYSTOCK	All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.

BIALYSTOCK	Do it!  Do it!
LIEBKIND	I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.

BIALYSTOCK	Do you need us?
LIEBKIND	Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.

BIALYSTOCK	Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
BIALYSTOCK	Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
BIALYSTOCK	Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
ULLA	Got dag pa dig.

ULLA	Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
BIALYSTOCK	Hey, Blum, have a cigar.

ULLA	Min Bialystock.
BIALYSTOCK	Nice girl.

BIALYSTOCK	Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.
BIALYSTOCK	Call chauffeur.  Get car.
ULLA	Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
BIALYSTOCK	No.  We go. 

ULLA	You, Blum go Motel.
BIALYSTOCK	No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
ULLA	Get car.  Get car.
BIALYSTOCK	Very nice girl.

ULLA	We make love?
BIALYSTOCK	No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.

BIALYSTOCK	Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
LITTLE OLD LADY	You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.

LITTLE OLD LADY	Finder's keepers.
BIALYSTOCK	Here I come, ready or not.

LITTLE OLD LADY	Feeling better?
LITTLE OLD LADY	Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
BIALYSTOCK	Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
LITTLE OLD LADY	We can't play today?
BIALYSTOCK	Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
LITTLE OLD LADY	Oh, the best one.
BIALYSTOCK	Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
LITTLE OLD LADY	Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
BIALYSTOCK	All right.  All right.

LITTLE OLD LADY	So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
BIALYSTOCK	I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
LITTLE OLD LADY	Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
BIALYSTOCK	Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.

BIALYSTOCK	Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
LITTLE OLD LADY	Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
BIALYSTOCK	Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
LITTLE OLD LADY	And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.

BIALYSTOCK	Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
LITTLE OLD LADY	And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.

BIALYSTOCK	Like clockwork.
LITTLE OLD LADY	I shall count the minutes.
BIALYSTOCK	Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!

LITTLE OLD LADY	Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
LITTLE OLD LADY	I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
LITTLE OLD LADY	Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
BIALYSTOCK	Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
LITTLE OLD LADY	Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
LITTLE OLD LADY	Ta.  Ta.
BIALYSTOCK	Ta.  Ta.

BIALYSTOCK	Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
LITTLE OLD LADY	Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.

LIEBKIND	Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.

LIEBKIND	Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
BLOOM	Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.

BLOOM	Okay.
LIEBKIND	Where are you going vit the light?
BLOOM	I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
LIEBKIND	Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.

LSD	Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
DE BRIS	What have you done, LSD?
LSD	Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
DE BRIS	I mean in show business.
LSD	Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
DE BRIS	What do you do best?
LSD	Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
DE BRIS	Oh, sing.  Sing!
LSD	Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
DE BRIS	Sing a song!  Just sing a song!

GENERAL	We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
LSD	No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
GENERAL	Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
LSD	Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
GENERAL	We can't... we keep our money there!

LSD	Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
GENERAL	Send for Goebbels.

LSD	He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
GOEBBELS	Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
LSD	What did you tell the people?
GOEBBELS	I told them we invaded England.
LSD	Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
GOEBBELS	We won.
LSD	Groovy!

DOLORES	We don't serve formula. Snookums.
BABY HERMAN	You serve martinis, doncha?
DOLORES	Yeah...

DOLORES	Oh, a ladies man, huh?
BABY HERMAN	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.

BABY HERMAN	No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
DOLORES	Well, I'll be...
BABY HERMAN	So what's your next move, Valiant?

BABY HERMAN	Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
VALIANT	I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
BABY HERMAN	Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
VALIANT	You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
BABY HERMAN	You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.

VALIANT	My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
BABY HERMAN	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?

BABY HERMAN	And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
VALIANT	So where is it then?
BABY HERMAN	Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.

BABY HERMAN	My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
VALIANT	Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?

BETTY BOOP	Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
VALIANT	Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
BETTY BOOP	Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
VALIANT	Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
BETTY BOOP	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
VALIANT	Shoulda guessed.
BETTY BOOP	He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
VALIANT	Big on the musical comedy, huh?
BETTY BOOP	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.

DIRECTOR	What's this, Roger?
ROGER RABBIT	A tweeting bird?
DIRECTOR	That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!

ROGER RABBIT	Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
DIRECTOR	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
DIRECTOR	I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.

DOLORES	So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
VALIANT	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.

DOLORES	This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
VALIANT	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
DOLORES	Is this paper even good?
VALIANT	Check the scrawl.
DOLORES	R.K. Maroon.

DOLORES	Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
VALIANT	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.

DOLORES	A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
VALIANT	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
DOLORES	Bastards put him on notice.

DOLORES	Do you think the rabbit did it?
VALIANT	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.

DOLORES	Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
VALIANT	Thanks for the vote of confidence.

DOLORES	The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
VALIANT	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?

DOLORES	So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
VALIANT	He's a Toon... who cares?

DOLORES	Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
VALIANT	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.

DOLORES	He's a riot.
VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
DOLORES	It's all yours.

DOLORES	So you decided to help him after all?
VALIANT	I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?

DOLORES	Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
VALIANT	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.

DOLORES	So what's the scam, Eddie?
VALIANT	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.

DOLORES	Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
VALIANT	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.

DOLORES	Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
VALIANT	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.

DOLORES	What was <u>that</u>?
VALIANT	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
DOLORES	The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
VALIANT	Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
DOLORES	I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
VALIANT	Maroon, right?
DOLORES	Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
VALIANT	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
DOLORES	Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.

VALIANT	What's that comin' from the bar?
DOLORES	Sounds like singin'.
VALIANT	Oh, no...

DOLORES	I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
VALIANT	I'll bet.
DOLORES	Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
VALIANT	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
DOLORES	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
VALIANT	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
DOLORES	Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.

VALIANT	He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
DOOM	Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
VALIANT	Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?

VALIANT	Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
DOOM	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
VALIANT	Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
DOOM	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
VALIANT	Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.

DOOM	Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
VALIANT	Ask her...

DOOM	Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
VALIANT	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.

VALIANT	They must've taken it off me.
DOOM	They?
VALIANT	The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.

DOOM	Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
VALIANT	Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
DOOM	Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.

VALIANT	You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
DOOM	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
VALIANT	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
DOOM	You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...

VALIANT	I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
DOOM	Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.

DOOM	Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
VALIANT	Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.

DOOM	These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
VALIANT	The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
DOOM	I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.

DOOM	No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
VALIANT	So you're Cloverleaf?
DOOM	No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.

VALIANT	Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
DOOM	It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.

VALIANT	Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
DOOM	They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?

DOOM	Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
VALIANT	What the hell's a freeway?
DOOM	A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
VALIANT	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
DOOM	Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.

VALIANT	Holy shit, he's a Toon!
DOOM	Surprised?
VALIANT	Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.

VALIANT	You?
DOOM	That's right, me.

EARL	Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
VALIANT	Earl... it's me, Valiant.
EARL	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
VALIANT	Toon cops worked me over.
EARL	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
VALIANT	What am I, Earl?

EARL	You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
VALIANT	No...
EARL	Does it hurt?
VALIANT	Not much.  It's hard to talk.
EARL	Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.

JESSICA RABBIT	Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
VALIANT	Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.

JESSICA RABBIT	Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
VALIANT	That's because I don't have a doorbell.

JESSICA RABBIT	Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
VALIANT	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.

VALIANT	Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
JESSICA RABBIT	Toons aren't given imperfections.
VALIANT	No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
JESSICA RABBIT	You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
VALIANT	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
JESSICA RABBIT	No, no, no... I love my husband.
VALIANT	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
JESSICA RABBIT	Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
VALIANT	Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
JESSICA RABBIT	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
VALIANT	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?

VALIANT	So altruistic.
JESSICA RABBIT	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
VALIANT	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
JESSICA RABBIT	If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?

VALIANT	You shot Roger.
JESSICA RABBIT	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.

VALIANT	Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
JESSICA RABBIT	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.

JESSICA RABBIT	It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
VALIANT	Why didn't you tell me?
JESSICA RABBIT	I didn't know who I could trust.
VALIANT	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
JESSICA RABBIT	Where is he?
VALIANT	He's right here in the...

VALIANT	How did you get onto Doom?
JESSICA RABBIT	Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.

VALIANT	So where is it?
JESSICA RABBIT	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
VALIANT	A joker to the end.

JESSICA RABBIT	Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
VALIANT	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
JESSICA RABBIT	He made me laugh.

VALIANT	Hold on a second.
JESSICA RABBIT	Eddie, come on.

LT. SANTINO	Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
VALIANT	That's what you woke me up for?

LT. SANTINO	Now what?
VALIANT	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.

LT. SANTINO	They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
VALIANT	What a gasser.
LT. SANTINO	Wait here...

VALIANT	Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
LT. SANTINO	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.

VALIANT	What's with the dip?
LT. SANTINO	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.

LT. SANTINO	What the hell is that?
VALIANT	Doom.
LT. SANTINO	Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?

MAROON	Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
VALIANT	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
MAROON	So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!

MAROON	How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
VALIANT	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.

MAROON	Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
VALIANT	One too many safes dropped on his head?
MAROON	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.

MAROON	Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
VALIANT	So what do you want me to do?
MAROON	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
VALIANT	I don't work in Toontown.
MAROON	You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
VALIANT	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
MAROON	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
VALIANT	So's the job.

MAROON	I got him on loan from Disney.
VALIANT	Aren't you the lucky one...

MAROON	When will I hear from you?
VALIANT	As soon as is humanly possible.

VALIANT	Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
MAROON	Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.

VALIANT	Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
MAROON	Sure, Valiant, sure...

VALIANT	Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
MAROON	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
VALIANT	I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
MAROON	I've already seen your photographs.
VALIANT	Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.

VALIANT	Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
MAROON	Have you got the will?
VALIANT	Maybe.  Why?
MAROON	Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
VALIANT	Stop what?

MAROON	Valiant!  You surprised me.
VALIANT	That was the idea.

VALIANT	You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
MAROON	No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
VALIANT	Well, everybody needs a hobby.
MAROON	No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.

MAROON	You got the will in there, don't ya?
VALIANT	No, I don't.
MAROON	You tricked me, damn you!
VALIANT	Take it easy.
MAROON	There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!

ROGER RABBIT	Pattycake!  Pattycake!
VALIANT	Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.

VALIANT	My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
ROGER RABBIT	Divorce?  Never!

VALIANT	Aah!
ROGER RABBIT	Aah!

VALIANT	What the hell are you doin'?
ROGER RABBIT	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
VALIANT	So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
ROGER RABBIT	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
VALIANT	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
ROGER RABBIT	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
VALIANT	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!

VALIANT	Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
ROGER RABBIT	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
VALIANT	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.

ROGER RABBIT	Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
VALIANT	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.

VALIANT	Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
ROGER RABBIT	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
VALIANT	Don't ever forget that.

ROGER RABBIT	Does this help?
VALIANT	Yeah, that's better.

VALIANT	You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
ROGER RABBIT	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.

VALIANT	Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
ROGER RABBIT	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
VALIANT	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.

VALIANT	Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
ROGER RABBIT	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
VALIANT	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.

ROGER RABBIT	The habeus corpus is thickening.
VALIANT	Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
ROGER RABBIT	How do you know that?
VALIANT	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.

ROGER RABBIT	Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
VALIANT	Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?

ROGER RABBIT	Hey, don't I get an encore?
VALIANT	Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
ROGER RABBIT	But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
VALIANT	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
ROGER RABBIT	Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
VALIANT	An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
ROGER RABBIT	Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
VALIANT	Just because you got 'em to laugh?
ROGER RABBIT	A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
VALIANT	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
ROGER RABBIT	I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
VALIANT	Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.

VALIANT	Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
ROGER RABBIT	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
VALIANT	I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?

VALIANT	Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
ROGER RABBIT	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
VALIANT	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.

ROGER RABBIT	Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
VALIANT	If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?

ROGER RABBIT	Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
VALIANT	My brother.  Get inside.

ROGER RABBIT	So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
VALIANT	We can't do anything till it's dark.

ROGER RABBIT	Say, who's this guy laughin'?
VALIANT	Me.
ROGER RABBIT	Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
VALIANT	What is this, Twenty Questions?

VALIANT	You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
ROGER RABBIT	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
VALIANT	You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
ROGER RABBIT	A Toon?  Noooo.
VALIANT	Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
ROGER RABBIT	Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
VALIANT	Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
ROGER RABBIT	Safe?
VALIANT	Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.

ROGER RABBIT	I'll get it.
VALIANT	Get away from there.

ROGER RABBIT	Wrong number?
VALIANT	No, it's not.

ROGER RABBIT	Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
VALIANT	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
ROGER RABBIT	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
VALIANT	Forget it.

ROGER RABBIT	You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
VALIANT	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
ROGER RABBIT	Two bits.
VALIANT	I rest my case.

VALIANT	If I don't make it back here by ten...
ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
VALIANT	... I'd head for Cucamonga.

VALIANT	What the hell are you doin' in there?
ROGER RABBIT	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.

VALIANT	Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
ROGER RABBIT	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.

VALIANT	That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
ROGER RABBIT	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
VALIANT	Yeah...

VALIANT	Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
ROGER RABBIT	Yeah?
VALIANT	I think you oughta read it to her.
ROGER RABBIT	Good idea.

VALIANT	Keep reading...
ROGER RABBIT	Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...

VALIANT	No, kid, you're a real hero.
ROGER RABBIT	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?

VALIANT	By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
ROGER RABBIT	And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
VALIANT	Only time will tell.

VALIANT	Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
ROGER RABBIT	From this box here...

DIANE	I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
AGENT	We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
DIANE	Pardon me?
AGENT	Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
DIANE	What's the profile?
AGENT	Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
DIANE	You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
AGENT	Don't let your father's business infect your life.
DIANE	How can you, how can you say that?
AGENT	Because he's guilty.
DIANE	No, no he's not.
AGENT	We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.

JIM	Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
AGENT SIMS	Understanding the following rights...
JIM	Speak with my lawyer.
AGENT SIMS	So you refuse to answer my questions?
JIM	Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
AGENT SIMS	Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
JIM	This evening is over.
AGENT SIMS	And your former wife.

AGENT SIMS	The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
JIM	What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
AGENT SIMS	Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
JIM	That's right.
AGENT SIMS	Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
JIM	Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.

JIM	Hi.
ASSISTANT	Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
JIM	No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
ASSISTANT	For going to school?
JIM	Yeah, she won a fellowship.
ASSISTANT	Good for her.
JIM	I'll take the whole set.
ASSISTANT	Excellent.

ASSISTANT	Thanks, I like yours too.
JIM	Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?

ASSISTANT	I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
JIM	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
ASSISTANT	Okay, thanks.

JIM	Keep it.
ASSISTANT	You're sure?
JIM	Yeah, I don't want it.  Um, thank you very much.  You're very kind.

CONSTANCE	Lloyd?
LLOYD	Hey, sis.
CONSTANCE	I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.

LLOYD	It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
CONSTANCE	I hope you understand.
LLOYD	Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?

CONSTANCE	Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
LLOYD	How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
CONSTANCE	Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
LLOYD	Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!

CONSTANCE	Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
LLOYD	Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
CONSTANCE	Gee, it's easy.
LLOYD	Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
CONSTANCE	I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
LLOYD	Yeah.
CONSTANCE	I still am.

LLOYD	You're tough, J-man.
CONSTANCE	He's a mess!

LLOYD	I'll be in my office.
CONSTANCE	I just washed this shirt, didn't I?

LLOYD	No, no, don't go in there.
CONSTANCE	Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!

LLOYD	Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
CONSTANCE	Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
LLOYD	I'll be home soon.

COREY	That's unlikely.
LLOYD	The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
COREY	But you never had a first date.
LLOYD	Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
COREY	That's not even a scam.
LLOYD	What's a scam?
COREY	Going out as friends.

COREY	Then what's love?
LLOYD	I'm gonna call her.
COREY	Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.

LLOYD	Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
COREY	Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.

LLOYD	Look at those eyes.
COREY	Lloyd, give it up.
LLOYD	Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
COREY	Lloyd.
LLOYD	C'mon, just do it.
COREY	C'mon Lloyd.
LLOYD	Please?
COREY	That's just so embarrassing.
LLOYD	Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.

LLOYD	Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
COREY	Okay, I got it.

COREY	You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
LLOYD	Hang in there, man.
COREY	Yes.
LLOYD	See you tomorrow.
COREY	See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.

COREY	Did you sleep with her?
LLOYD	I admit nothing.

LLOYD	Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
COREY	Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
LLOYD	So, what's your point?
COREY	You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.

LLOYD	Alright.
COREY	Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
LLOYD	I already did.

COREY	What does it say?
LLOYD	Read it.

LLOYD	I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
COREY	Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.

COREY	No, you're not a guy.
LLOYD	I am.
COREY	The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
LLOYD	If she wants me, she can come to me.

COREY	I don't feel anything.
DC	Come on, it's graduation.
COREY	Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
DC	He wants to leave things on a good note.
COREY	Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.

DC	Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
COREY	Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.

DC	I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
COREY	I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.

COREY	Lloyd is doomed.
DC	Meaning?
COREY	Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.

DC	I told him to be himself.
COREY	He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.

DC	Lloyd, it's us.
COREY	Look at his face, he did the deed.
DC	You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.

DC	Wait a minute.
COREY	You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
DC	Wait a minute.
COREY	And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
DC	You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
COREY	What?  I'm sorry, talk.
DC	I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.

COREY	Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd.  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
DC	I dream about it.

COREY	I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
REBECCA	I just saw Joe.  He's here.
COREY	Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.

REBECCA	Why?
COREY	It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
REBECCA	What is wrong with this girl?

REBECCA	Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
COREY	If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?

U.S. ATTORNEY	I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
COURT'S ATTORNEY	One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
U.S. ATTORNEY	One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
COURT'S ATTORNEY	I can accept that.
U.S. ATTORNEY	And I want to turn the home over to the state.
COURT'S ATTORNEY	He'd like to start serving immediately.
U.S. ATTORNEY	I can put that together.
COURT'S ATTORNEY	Confirm this with my office and my client.
U.S. ATTORNEY	I'll put this past my boss
COURT'S ATTORNEY	Alright.

DC	Lloyd, she's being difficult.
LLOYD	I'm going to take out Diane Court again.

LLOYD	That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
DC	Look, why don't you just call Diane again?

DC	Visit her at the home.
LLOYD	I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
DC	Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
LLOYD	'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.

DIANE	Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
JIM	Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.

DIANE	Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
JIM	Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
DIANE	You like it?
JIM	Oh yeah!
DIANE	I didn't think anyone would get it.
JIM	Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
DIANE	Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
JIM	Okay.

JIM	Ha!
DIANE	Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.

DIANE	Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
JIM	Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.

DIANE	What are you doing?
JIM	Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.

DIANE	God, that's... this is ridiculous.
JIM	Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
DIANE	Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...

JIM	They really applauded you today honey.
DIANE	I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
JIM	No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
DIANE	Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
JIM	Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
DIANE	Stop it, stop it, stop it.
JIM	I'm sorry.
DIANE	I love you dad.
JIM	I love you too honey.

DIANE	What?
JIM	I just had a phone call.
DIANE	Tell me, is it bad news?
JIM	No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
DIANE	Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
JIM	You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
DIANE	I won?
JIM	You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.

DIANE	God, I'll have to go on a plane.
JIM	We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.

DIANE	Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
JIM	No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.

JIM	Morning honey.
DIANE	Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
JIM	Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
DIANE	Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
JIM	Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.

DIANE	Goodnight.
JIM	Goodnight.

JIM	She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
DIANE	Dad.
JIM	Now why can't I tell the story?

JIM	Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
DIANE	I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
JIM	Crash paranoia.

JIM	So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
DIANE	And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
JIM	Which they did.  Let me finish.
DIANE	Okay, I give up.
JIM	So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.

JIM	Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
DIANE	Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.

JIM	Morning.
DIANE	Dad, I'm sorry.
JIM	You should be.
DIANE	I was irresponsible, I should have called.
JIM	You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
DIANE	Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
JIM	You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
DIANE	I'm fine.
JIM	Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
DIANE	I know that.

JIM	Lloyd?
DIANE	Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
JIM	Sit down.

JIM	Did he ever get rough with you?
DIANE	Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.

DIANE	Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
JIM	You're going.
DIANE	But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
JIM	You're going.
DIANE	It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
JIM	Bon voyage.
DIANE	You're not listening to me.
JIM	Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
DIANE	Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?

JIM	Do you love him?
DIANE	I like him a lot.
JIM	Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.

DIANE	Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
JIM	Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
DIANE	Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
JIM	Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.

DIANE	Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
JIM	'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
DIANE	Dad, I love him.

DIANE	If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
JIM	Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.

DIANE	Dad, are you okay in there?
JIM	Just finishing up in here.

JIM	What happened to you?
DIANE	Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
JIM	Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
DIANE	Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
JIM	Honey!
DIANE	Swear to god.
JIM	I swear to god.
DIANE	But I found the money.
JIM	Honey, it's not what you think.
DIANE	What am I supposed to think?
JIM	Honey, about what?
DIANE	You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
JIM	You think you know what this money is?
DIANE	Yes, I...
JIM	No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
DIANE	No, but you stole from them.
JIM	I made their lives better.
DIANE	You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
JIM	Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
DIANE	I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
JIM	Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
DIANE	No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
JIM	That's right, work it out.
DIANE	No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
JIM	Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
DIANE	I'm so ashamed dad.
JIM	Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
DIANE	You're right.

DIANE	Hello.
JIM	Hi.
DIANE	I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.

DIANE	Mom, please?
MRS COURT	Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
DIANE	This is me telling you about me.
MRS COURT	You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
DIANE	I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
MRS COURT	If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
DIANE	If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
MRS COURT	Alright.
DIANE	You will?
MRS COURT	Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.

DIANE	Thank-you.  The real world.
LLOYD	Look at those eyes.

LLOYD	No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
DIANE	Hi.  You called me?
LLOYD	Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
DIANE	Yeah?
LLOYD	Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
DIANE	Thank you very much.
LLOYD	Whoah, what a day, huh?
DIANE	Yeah.  What a day.
LLOYD	Yeah.
DIANE	Yeah.
LLOYD	Quick question - do you know who I am?
DIANE	Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
LLOYD	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
DIANE	No, I read it on the message.
LLOYD	Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
DIANE	Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
LLOYD	Busy?
DIANE	Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
LLOYD	Are you busy on Friday?
DIANE	Yeah, I have to help my father.
LLOYD	Are you busy on Saturday?
DIANE	Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
LLOYD	So you're monumentally busy?
DIANE	Well, not monumentally.
LLOYD	What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
DIANE	Hmmm....
LLOYD	Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,

DIANE	Actually, I think that I...
LLOYD	Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,

DIANE	Well...
LLOYD	No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
DIANE	I'll go.
LLOYD	Pardon me?
DIANE	I'll go.
LLOYD	You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?

LLOYD	Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
DIANE	Eight.
LLOYD	Eight. Eight O' clock.
DIANE	Goodbye.
LLOYD	Goodbye.

LLOYD	Whoa.
DIANE	Would you hold this for me?
LLOYD	Yeah

DIANE	What are these?
LLOYD	They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
DIANE	Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
LLOYD	No.

DIANE	Keymaster?
LLOYD	Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
DIANE	So it's an honor?
LLOYD	No.

LLOYD	So we can finally talk?
DIANE	Yeah.

DIANE	He does this every year?
LLOYD	It's the worst job since keymaster.

DIANE	Thank-you.
LLOYD	I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.

LLOYD	Have a good sleep.
DIANE	Bye.

DIANE	Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
LLOYD	Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
DIANE	Nobody knew me before tonight.
LLOYD	They knew of you.  Now they know you.
DIANE	Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
LLOYD	That's cool then.
DIANE	Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.

LLOYD	It's just you and your dad, right?
DIANE	Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
LLOYD	Sure I do.
DIANE	Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
LLOYD	Watch out for that glass.

DIANE	Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
LLOYD	Twisted?
DIANE	You know what?
LLOYD	What?
DIANE	You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
LLOYD	Basic.  Hmmm.
DIANE	So what's your job this summer?
LLOYD	Job?  Being a great date.
DIANE	No, I'm serious.
LLOYD	So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
DIANE	I only have something like sixteen weeks.
LLOYD	Sixteen weeks is a long time.
DIANE	Then call me tomorrow.
LLOYD	Today is tomorrow.
DIANE	Then call me later.

LLOYD	Yeah.
DIANE	Or, or I could always wear this one.

LLOYD	Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
DIANE	Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.

LLOYD	Nice one.
DIANE	Yeah?
LLOYD	I think you should wear that.
DIANE	You think so?
LLOYD	Mmmm.

LLOYD	Oh.
DIANE	I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.

LLOYD	After work?
DIANE	I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
LLOYD	Won't you see me later?
DIANE	I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
LLOYD	Me?  Sure I do.
DIANE	Come on.
LLOYD	Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers

DIANE	I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
LLOYD	Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,

DIANE	Stop by later.
LLOYD	Okay, bye, I will.
DIANE	Okay, bye.
LLOYD	I'll see you there.  Bye.

DIANE	You have to meet Bess.
LLOYD	Okay.
DIANE	She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
LLOYD	Wait, wait.  You told her about me?

DIANE	Yes.
LLOYD	What did you say?
DIANE	Well... just meet her.

LLOYD	It's okay, everybody does that.
DIANE	I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
LLOYD	No.
DIANE	I just can't have any social life right now.
LLOYD	Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
DIANE	Be friends?
LLOYD	Yeah.  With potential.
DIANE	Friends with potential.

LLOYD	Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
DIANE	Yeah.
LLOYD	You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
DIANE	I'm doing alright.
LLOYD	Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
DIANE	Yeah?
LLOYD	If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
DIANE	Right.

LLOYD	Okay, this is important...
DIANE	Am I wrecking my car?
LLOYD	Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
DIANE	Oh.  I was putting the...

LLOYD	Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
DIANE	Yeah.
LLOYD	Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
DIANE	This is so noble.
LLOYD	Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.

LLOYD	Let's get outta here.  You want to?
DIANE	Yeah.

LLOYD	Are you comfortable?
DIANE	Yes.  Are you shaking?
LLOYD	No.
DIANE	You're shaking.
LLOYD	I don't think so.
DIANE	You're cold.
LLOYD	I don't think I am.
DIANE	Then why are you shaking?
LLOYD	I don't know.  I'm happy.
DIANE	Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.

LLOYD	Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
DIANE	Your letter came yesterday.
LLOYD	It did?
DIANE	Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
LLOYD	Why didn't you tell me?
DIANE	It was wonderful.
LLOYD	I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
DIANE	No, we don't have to say it.
LLOYD	How do you know what I'm going to say?
DIANE	I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
LLOYD	I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
DIANE	I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
LLOYD	What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
DIANE	How can I look at you and say this?
LLOYD	Say what?

DIANE	I think that we should spend some time apart.
LLOYD	What's wrong?
DIANE	Well, I need to study, and...
LLOYD	You need to study?
DIANE	Yeah.
LLOYD	Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
DIANE	We'll see.
LLOYD	Okay.  It's good knowing this.
DIANE	Yeah, uh-huh.

LLOYD	Okay, what did we just decide?
DIANE	We decided...
LLOYD	'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
DIANE	No, no.
LLOYD	It sounded like you did.
DIANE	No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
LLOYD	Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
DIANE	I think that we should stop going out on dates.
LLOYD	I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
DIANE	No, I don't, I don't.
LLOYD	Yeah you do.
DIANE	Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
LLOYD	You shared it with a dick.
DIANE	No I didn't.
LLOYD	Is this because of your dad?
DIANE	No.
LLOYD	Did you talk to Corey?
DIANE	Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
LLOYD	She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
DIANE	No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
LLOYD	Did you tell anybody?
DIANE	Just my dad.
LLOYD	You told your dad?
DIANE	You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
LLOYD	What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
DIANE	Lloyd, I love you, okay?
LLOYD	What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
DIANE	Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
LLOYD	Then don't do it.
DIANE	Oh shit.

LLOYD	What do you want?
DIANE	I'm sorry.
LLOYD	What do you want?
DIANE	My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
LLOYD	You do?
DIANE	Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
LLOYD	Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
DIANE	I love you.
LLOYD	What?
DIANE	I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
LLOYD	One more time would be nice.
DIANE	I love you.  Please, I love you.

DIANE	I'm fine.
LLOYD	Okay, good, this is all very noble.

DIANE	Okay.
LLOYD	Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
DIANE	Okay.
LLOYD	So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
DIANE	Good to know.
LLOYD	Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
DIANE	Okay.
LLOYD	Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
DIANE	Not right now, thanks.

LLOYD	How's it going?
DIANE	Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
LLOYD	No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
DIANE	I know.

GUY 2	Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
MARK	Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.

MARK	It's your castle, man.
GUY 2	Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
MARK	Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
GUY 2	Man, you're bringing me down!

GUY 2	You're freaking out here man.
MARK	You've gotta get her out of your head, man.

JASON	Yeah.
LLOYD	Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.

JASON	YEAH!
LLOYD	He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
JASON	No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
LLOYD	Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.

JASON	PAIN!
LLOYD	Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.

JIM	Jim Court?
LLOYD	Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
JIM	Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
LLOYD	Uh... okay... um...
JIM	Is this the guy with the Mustang?
LLOYD	No.
JIM	The guy with the Datsun?
LLOYD	No.
JIM	The truck?
LLOYD	Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.

JIM	Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
LLOYD	Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.

JIM	Okay, I'll give here the message.
LLOYD	Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
JIM	What?
LLOYD	She's really pretty great, isn't she?
JIM	Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
LLOYD	Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
JIM	Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...

LLOYD	Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
JIM	Hello Lloyd.
LLOYD	Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
JIM	Fine Lloyd.
LLOYD	How ya doing?  Is she around?
JIM	Yeah.  Honey?

JIM	Thanks Lloyd.
LLOYD	How do you pay for one of those?
JIM	Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.

JIM	Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
LLOYD	Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
JIM	Seriously, Lloyd.
LLOYD	I'm totally and completely serious.
JIM	No, really.
LLOYD	You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.

LLOYD	Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
JIM	Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
LLOYD	I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?

LLOYD	She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
JIM	Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
LLOYD	That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
JIM	Are you?
LLOYD	Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
JIM	Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
LLOYD	I know.
JIM	She's very successful.
LLOYD	I know
JIM	Very talented.
LLOYD	I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
JIM	You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
LLOYD	I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
JIM	I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.

JIM	You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel...
LLOYD	I know this part, keep reading.
JIM	She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
LLOYD	It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
JIM	Just her name.
LLOYD	Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.

LLOYD	Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
JOE	So what's up?
LLOYD	Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
JOE	Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.

LLOYD	My car.
JOE	Your car?

LLOYD	Diane Court.
JOE	Dude, I can't do it!

MISS EVANS	Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
LLOYD	How ya doin' Miss Evans?
MISS EVANS	You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
LLOYD	No way.
MISS EVANS	Lloyd.
LLOYD	What?

MISS EVANS	Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
LLOYD	My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
MISS EVANS	We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.

MISS EVANS	Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
LLOYD	How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
MISS EVANS	Hang tough, Lloyd.

MIKE	Oh boy.
LLOYD	Hey.
MIKE	Mike Cameron, how you doing?
LLOYD	What?
MIKE	Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
LLOYD	Yeah.
MIKE	Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
LLOYD	I called her up.
MIKE	Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
LLOYD	I'm Lloyd Dobler.
MIKE	This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
LLOYD	Alright.  Key?

MIKE	Ooop, excuse me.
LLOYD	How you doin', brother?
MIKE	I don't really know where we are.

VALHERE	It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
LLOYD	You know Diane Court?
VALHERE	Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.

LLOYD	Oh, I was just going to...
VALHERE	A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
LLOYD	I was gonna...
VALHERE	Thanks a lot Lloyd.
LLOYD	I was just going to kind of move around.

VALHERE	You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
LLOYD	I don't know.
VALHERE	I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
LLOYD	Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
VALHERE	Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.

VALHERE	Certainly.
LLOYD	I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.

MARK	We finally graduated, big dude guy!
LLOYD	Alright!

MARK	I love you man
LLOYD	I love you too.

MARK	Give me my firebird keys!
LLOYD	You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
MARK	I love you man.
LLOYD	Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
MARK	We're full on bonded.
LLOYD	Yeah, alright.

MARK	Later for you, Luke.
LLOYD	I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?

RASHID	It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
APRIL	Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.

APRIL	What!
RASHID	Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
APRIL	No! At least I don't think I am!
RASHID	Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
APRIL	An invitation?

APRIL	And what's the occasion of this celebration?
RASHID	It's my birthday.
APRIL	And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
RASHID	I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
APRIL	Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
RASHID	Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
APRIL	And what are you, his chaperone?
RASHID	Actually, I'm his father.

RASHID	Like me, too.
APRIL	I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
RASHID	No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.

APRIL	Will that be cash or charge?
PAUL	Better make it charge. 
APRIL	I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
PAUL	I confess.
APRIL	I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?

PAUL	So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
APRIL	Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
PAUL	And your father? Is he from New York?
APRIL	Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
PAUL	Just like me.

PAUL	And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
APRIL	It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
PAUL	Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
APRIL	American literature. What else?
PAUL	What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
APRIL	Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
PAUL	Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
APRIL	Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
PAUL	Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
APRIL	That's the subject of my last chapter.
PAUL	Not an easy book.
APRIL	Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.

APRIL	Jesus, what happened to you?
PAUL	It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
APRIL	What happened?
PAUL	I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
APRIL	It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
PAUL	Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
APRIL	Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.

PAUL	I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
APRIL	I'd love to.
PAUL	Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
APRIL	I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
PAUL	Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
APRIL	Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
PAUL	Forty-one pages.

WAITER	What'll it be, Auggie?
AUGGIE	Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.

WAITER	And what about for you?
AUGGIE	Huh?
WAITER	What about for you?
AUGGIE	For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
WAITER	Do me a favor, will you?
AUGGIE	What's that, Sol?
WAITER	Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
AUGGIE	What's the difference?
WAITER	It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
AUGGIE	Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
WAITER	Thanks. I knew you'd understand.

PAUL	Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
AUGGIE	Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
PAUL	Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
AUGGIE	The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
PAUL	Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
AUGGIE	The Queen of England?
PAUL	Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?

AUGGIE	Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
PAUL	I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.

PAUL	Are you closed?
AUGGIE	You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
PAUL	Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
AUGGIE	No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.

PAUL	Looks like someone forgot a camera.
AUGGIE	Yeah, I did.
PAUL	It's yours?
AUGGIE	It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
PAUL	I didn't know you took pictures.
AUGGIE	I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
PAUL	So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
AUGGIE	That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
PAUL	How'd you get started?
AUGGIE	Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
PAUL	A photographer ...
AUGGIE	Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
PAUL	I'd like to see your pictures some day.
AUGGIE	It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.

PAUL	They're all the same.
AUGGIE	That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
PAUL	I've never seen anything like it.
AUGGIE	It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
PAUL	Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
AUGGIE	I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
PAUL	It's kind of overwhelming.
AUGGIE	You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
PAUL	What do you mean?
AUGGIE	I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
PAUL	But they're all the same.
AUGGIE	They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
PAUL	Slow down, huh?
AUGGIE	Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.

AUGGIE	Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
PAUL	It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.

AUGGIE	Hey, man, good to see you.
PAUL	This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.

AUGGIE	So, what brings you to a dive like this?
PAUL	It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
AUGGIE	How old, kid?

PAUL	Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
AUGGIE	Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
PAUL	I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
AUGGIE	Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.

PAUL	The kid's sorry, Auggie.
AUGGIE	Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
PAUL	He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
AUGGIE	If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?

PAUL	Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
AUGGIE	He's crazy.
PAUL	No, he's not. You are.
AUGGIE	You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
PAUL	It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
AUGGIE	Fuck you, kid.

PAUL	It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
AUGGIE	Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
PAUL	No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
AUGGIE	Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
PAUL	For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.

PAUL	You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
AUGGIE	Not a peep.
PAUL	I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
AUGGIE	That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
PAUL	Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?

PAUL	So what did he say when he called?
AUGGIE	Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.

PAUL	Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
AUGGIE	It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.

PAUL	It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
AUGGIE	We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.

AUGGIE	Hey, man, how's it going?
PAUL	Hi, Auggie.

AUGGIE	Two, right?
PAUL	Uh, better make it one.
AUGGIE	You usually get two.
PAUL	Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
AUGGIE	Ah-hah.

PAUL	Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
AUGGIE	That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
PAUL	Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
AUGGIE	Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
PAUL	Anything good?
AUGGIE	Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
PAUL	It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
AUGGIE	Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 

PAUL	I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
AUGGIE	You got it.

PAUL	So. Are we ready?
AUGGIE	Ready. Any time you are.
PAUL	I'm all ears.
AUGGIE	Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
PAUL	Every word.
AUGGIE	Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....

PAUL	Did you ever go back to see her?
AUGGIE	Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
PAUL	She probably died.
AUGGIE	Yeah, probably.
PAUL	Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
AUGGIE	I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
PAUL	It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
AUGGIE	I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
PAUL	You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
AUGGIE	Anything for art, eh, Paul?
PAUL	I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
AUGGIE	And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
PAUL	Yes, I suppose I do.

AUGGIE	What do you mean?
PAUL	I mean, it's a good story.
AUGGIE	Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
PAUL	Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?

AUGGIE	Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
RUBY	Eighteen and a half years.
AUGGIE	Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
RUBY	You're looking good, Auggie.
AUGGIE	No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
RUBY	I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
AUGGIE	And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
RUBY	You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
AUGGIE	At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
RUBY	I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
AUGGIE	Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
RUBY	This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
AUGGIE	You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?

AUGGIE	All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
RUBY	Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
AUGGIE	Like what?
RUBY	Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
AUGGIE	Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
RUBY	Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
AUGGIE	Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
RUBY	Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
AUGGIE	Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
RUBY	It means "happiness."
AUGGIE	I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
RUBY	I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
AUGGIE	You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
RUBY	Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
AUGGIE	That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
RUBY	You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
AUGGIE	Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
RUBY	It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
AUGGIE	You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
RUBY	It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
AUGGIE	A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
RUBY	And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
AUGGIE	You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
RUBY	Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
AUGGIE	Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
RUBY	Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
AUGGIE	Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
RUBY	I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
AUGGIE	Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
RUBY	You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
AUGGIE	I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.

RUBY	Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
AUGGIE	You don't give up, do you?
RUBY	Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
AUGGIE	Where to?
RUBY	Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.

RUBY	I told her she was going to meet her father.
AUGGIE	You what?
RUBY	It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
AUGGIE	I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
RUBY	Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
AUGGIE	Yeah, like what?
RUBY	That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
AUGGIE	Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
RUBY	Wait till you see her, Auggie.
AUGGIE	And what's that supposed to mean?
RUBY	She looks just like you.
AUGGIE	Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
RUBY	When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.

AUGGIE	Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
RUBY	You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.

AUGGIE	So you're just going to give up and go home?
RUBY	I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
AUGGIE	Still, you can't just write her off.
RUBY	Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
AUGGIE	She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
RUBY	Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
AUGGIE	Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
RUBY	I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
AUGGIE	No you're not.
RUBY	Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
AUGGIE	Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
RUBY	Bully for you.
AUGGIE	No, bully for you.

RUBY	What's this?
AUGGIE	Why don't you open it and find out?
RUBY	Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
AUGGIE	Five thousand bucks.
RUBY	And you're giving it to me?
AUGGIE	It's all yours, baby.
RUBY	For keeps?
AUGGIE	For keeps.
RUBY	I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.

AUGGIE	Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
RUBY	I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.

AUGGIE	There's just one thing I want to know.
RUBY	Anything, Auggie. Just name it.

VINNIE	Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
AUGGIE	No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
VINNIE	How long you been working for me, Auggie?
AUGGIE	I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
VINNIE	It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
AUGGIE	I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
VINNIE	Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
AUGGIE	I almost got married once.
VINNIE	Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
AUGGIE	Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
VINNIE	Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
AUGGIE	She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
VINNIE	Lovely.
AUGGIE	She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
VINNIE	You don't take anything seriously, do you?
AUGGIE	I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
VINNIE	I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
AUGGIE	Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
VINNIE	They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
AUGGIE	Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
VINNIE	Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
AUGGIE	It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
VINNIE	No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
AUGGIE	It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
VINNIE	Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
AUGGIE	They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
VINNIE	I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
AUGGIE	Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.

RASHID	Seventeen.
AUGGIE	Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
RASHID	Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
AUGGIE	Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 

RASHID	A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
AUGGIE	Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
RASHID	Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.

AUGGIE	I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
RASHID	Sure thing. See you later.

RASHID	A little. Not much.
AUGGIE	This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?

RASHID	It's for you.
AUGGIE	For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
RASHID	Open it.
AUGGIE	What is this, some kind of joke?
RASHID	No, it's five thousand dollars.
AUGGIE	Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
RASHID	What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
AUGGIE	And why the hell would you give me money?
RASHID	So I can get my job back.
AUGGIE	Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
RASHID	To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
AUGGIE	You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?

AUGGIE	Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
RASHID	What difference does it make?

AUGGIE	How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
JIMMY	Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
AUGGIE	It'll never be finished.
JIMMY	Huh?
AUGGIE	That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
JIMMY	I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.

JIMMY	Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
AUGGIE	When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
JIMMY	Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.

AUGGIE	... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
JIMMY	Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
AUGGIE	Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.

JIMMY	Does it hurt?
AUGGIE	Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
JIMMY	I thought maybe he was pretending.

AUGGIE	They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
YOUNG MAN	And how much are these?
AUGGIE	Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
YOUNG MAN	And these?
AUGGIE	Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
YOUNG MAN	And these?
AUGGIE	Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
YOUNG MAN	I think I'll take them. 
AUGGIE	A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
YOUNG MAN	The refrigerator?
AUGGIE	It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
YOUNG MAN	Thanks for the tip.
AUGGIE	Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
YOUNG MAN	What does that mean?
AUGGIE	Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?

AUNT EM	Is your name Paul Benjamin?
PAUL	What can I do for you?
AUNT EM	I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
PAUL	How the hell did you get into the building?
AUNT EM	What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
PAUL	The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
AUNT EM	I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
PAUL	Thomas? Who's Thomas?
AUNT EM	Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
PAUL	I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
AUNT EM	Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
PAUL	You mean Rashid?
AUNT EM	Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
PAUL	Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
AUNT EM	And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
PAUL	Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
AUNT EM	I just want to know where he is.
PAUL	As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
AUNT EM	His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
PAUL	That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
AUNT EM	I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
PAUL	He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
AUNT EM	He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
PAUL	And his parents?
AUNT EM	His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
PAUL	I shouldn't have let him go.
AUNT EM	Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
PAUL	I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
AUNT EM	He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
PAUL	Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
AUNT EM	No thank you.
PAUL	Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
AUNT EM	Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
PAUL	And you told your nephew about it?
AUNT EM	I figured he had a right to know.
PAUL	And?
AUNT EM	And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
PAUL	Those are pretty hostile words.

AUNT EM	His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
PAUL	You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
AUNT EM	Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
PAUL	Jesus.
AUNT EM	Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
PAUL	It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
AUNT EM	No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
PAUL	And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
AUNT EM	Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.

CYRUS	You going to sit here all day?
RASHID	I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
CYRUS	Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
RASHID	It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
CYRUS	Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
RASHID	I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
CYRUS	I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
RASHID	Just passing through.
CYRUS	Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
RASHID	I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
CYRUS	It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
RASHID	It'll cost you five bucks.
CYRUS	Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
RASHID	Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
CYRUS	Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
RASHID	I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
CYRUS	Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
RASHID	Not a one.
CYRUS	Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
RASHID	It was just a thought.
CYRUS	Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.

CYRUS	I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
RASHID	What's your offer?
CYRUS	Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
RASHID	Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
CYRUS	Benefits?
RASHID	You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
CYRUS	I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
RASHID	Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
CYRUS	The name is Cyrus Cole.
RASHID	Paul. Paul Benjamin.

RASHID	I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
CYRUS	An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
RASHID	And have you mended them?
CYRUS	I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
RASHID	You named the kid after yourself, huh?
CYRUS	That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.

RASHID	It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
CYRUS	And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
RASHID	Hi there, little brother.
CYRUS	Say hi to Paul.

CYRUS	That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
RASHID	Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
CYRUS	Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
RASHID	That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.

RASHID	Thomas.
CYRUS	Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
RASHID	Thomas.

RASHID	Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
CYRUS	Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!

CYRUS	I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
RASHID	Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
CYRUS	You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!

FELICITY	Yeah? Who is it?
RUBY	It's me, honey. It's Mom.

RUBY	Well?
FELICITY	Well what?
RUBY	Aren't you going to say anything?
FELICITY	What do you want me to say?
RUBY	I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
FELICITY	I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.

RUBY	Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
FELICITY	Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.

RUBY	You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
FELICITY	Baby? And what baby is that?
RUBY	Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
FELICITY	Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
RUBY	What are you talking about?
FELICITY	An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!

TOMMY	I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
JERRY	Yeah? And why is that?
TOMMY	Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.

TOMMY	Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
JERRY	Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
TOMMY	They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.

TOMMY	Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
JERRY	I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.

TOMMY	Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
JERRY	I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?

JERRY	Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?
JIMMY	Huh?
JERRY	You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
JIMMY	Tick-tock, tick-tock.
JERRY	So what's the time?
JIMMY	Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.

RASHID	Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
PAUL	I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
RASHID	No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
PAUL	No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
RASHID	I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
PAUL	I owe you something.
RASHID	It's okay, mister. No big deal.
PAUL	Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
RASHID	Well, if you put it that way...
PAUL	You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
RASHID	That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
PAUL	Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
RASHID	I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
PAUL	Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
RASHID	Rashid. Rashid Cole. 

PAUL	Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
RASHID	That's okay. I've already had lunch.
PAUL	You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
RASHID	I mean breakfast.
PAUL	Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
RASHID	Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
PAUL	Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
RASHID	Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
PAUL	Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.

RASHID	Mostly what.
PAUL	You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
RASHID	You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
PAUL	That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
RASHID	Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
PAUL	And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
RASHID	East Seventy-fourth Street.
PAUL	In Manhattan?
RASHID	Of course. Where else?
PAUL	Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
RASHID	That's where the what comes in.
PAUL	The what?
RASHID	The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
PAUL	You can't be more specific than that?

RASHID	Here and there. Around.
PAUL	Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
RASHID	Yeah, that's right.
PAUL	Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
RASHID	The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
PAUL	But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
RASHID	People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
PAUL	I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
RASHID	Thanks, but I'll manage.
PAUL	In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
RASHID	I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
PAUL	Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 

PAUL	I didn't expect to see you again.
RASHID	Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.

PAUL	That's it. Just the two rooms.
RASHID	This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
PAUL	I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
RASHID	But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
PAUL	I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
RASHID	Nice drawing. Did you do that?
PAUL	My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
RASHID	Yeah, I can believe it.
PAUL	It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
RASHID	Is your father an artist?
PAUL	No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
RASHID	He's dead?
PAUL	Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
RASHID	Drawing's a good thing.
PAUL	Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
RASHID	Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.

PAUL	Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
RASHID	What time is it?
PAUL	Eight-thirty.
RASHID	Eight-thirty?
PAUL	You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.

PAUL	Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
RASHID	I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
PAUL	A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
RASHID	I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
PAUL	The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
RASHID	Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
PAUL	If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.

RASHID	I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
PAUL	It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
RASHID	I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
PAUL	How long have you been here?
RASHID	Three nights.
PAUL	And how long did I tell you you could stay?
RASHID	Two or three nights.
PAUL	It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
RASHID	I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
PAUL	No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
RASHID	You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
PAUL	Are you going to be all right?
RASHID	Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
PAUL	Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
RASHID	Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
PAUL	Take good care of yourself, okay?
RASHID	You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 

PAUL	Hey, it's you.
RASHID	I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
PAUL	Appreciation for what?
RASHID	I don't know. For helping me out.
PAUL	Where did you get that thing?
RASHID	I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
PAUL	Where the hell do you think you're going?
RASHID	Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
PAUL	Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
RASHID	I don't have much time. 
PAUL	Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
RASHID	You don't really want to know.
PAUL	I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
RASHID	Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
PAUL	And?
RASHID	I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
PAUL	So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?

RASHID	I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
PAUL	Why don't you go to the police?
RASHID	You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
PAUL	If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
RASHID	The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
PAUL	What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
RASHID	It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
PAUL	It looks like they've met in this apartment.
RASHID	That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
PAUL	Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
RASHID	Let's not get too idealistic.
PAUL	Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.

PAUL	Ah, coffee. Smells good.
RASHID	One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
PAUL	Thanks. 
RASHID	What time did you get to bed last night?
PAUL	I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
RASHID	You work too hard, you know that?
PAUL	Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
RASHID	Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
PAUL	If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
RASHID	That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
PAUL	If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
RASHID	Come on, just a little hint.
PAUL	Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
RASHID	The inspiration.
PAUL	Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
RASHID	No way.
PAUL	All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
RASHID	The end.
PAUL	No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.

PAUL	Celebrate? What for?
RASHID	It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
PAUL	Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
RASHID	I just did.
PAUL	I mean earlier. We could have planned something.

RASHID	Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
PAUL	Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.

PAUL	Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
RASHID	Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?

RASHID	Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
PAUL	Absolutely. We would be honored.

PAUL	It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
RASHID	His only copy?
PAUL	His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
RASHID	Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
PAUL	You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.

RASHID	I don't know.
PAUL	Is it yours?
RASHID	Yeah, it might be.
PAUL	Here, catch.

PAUL	So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
RASHID	Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
PAUL	Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
RASHID	Yeah, I picked it up.
PAUL	And started to run.
RASHID	And started to run.
PAUL	Good thinking.
RASHID	That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
PAUL	You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
RASHID	Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
PAUL	So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
RASHID	That's it. In a nutshell.
PAUL	Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
RASHID	No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
PAUL	A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
RASHID	That money is my whole future.
PAUL	Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?

PAUL	So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
RASHID	It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
PAUL	Well?
RASHID	It wasn't my fault.
PAUL	If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
RASHID	The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....

PAUL	Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
RASHID	I suppose so. He never told me about it.
PAUL	No wonder he was angry.
RASHID	He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....

PAUL	Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
RASHID	What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
PAUL	I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
RASHID	I'm not going to do it.
PAUL	You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
RASHID	I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
PAUL	Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.

RASHID	Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
PAUL	Good. I'm glad that's settled!

PAUL	Hi, kid.
RASHID	Wow. They sure did a job on you.
PAUL	Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.

PAUL	We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
RASHID	It's all right. I really do know them.

PAUL	If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
RASHID	I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .

RASHID	Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
PAUL	Now ask him who his mother was.

PAUL	Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
WAITRESS	Hot coffee or iced coffee?
PAUL	Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
WAITRESS	Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.

PAUL	I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
WAITRESS	If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
PAUL	I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?

WAITRESS	How do you want that cooked?
RASHID	Medium rare, please.
WAITRESS	Fries?
RASHID	Yes, please.
WAITRESS	Lettuce and tomato?
RASHID	Yes, please.
WAITRESS	You want another one of these, too?

BELLHOP	Are these your bags?
JOE	Yes.  And that one, too.
BELLHOP	Okay, doll.
JOE	I suppose you want a tip?
BELLHOP	Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
JOE	Bye.
BELLHOP	Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
JOE	Why?
BELLHOP	Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
JOE	Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
BELLHOP	Wanna see my driver's license?
JOE	Get lost, will you?
BELLHOP	That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.

BELLHOP	Which of you dolls is Daphne?
JOE	Bull fiddle.

BELLHOP	It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
JOE	Beat it, Buster.
BELLHOP	Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.

SUE	Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
BIENSTOCK	Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.

SUE	Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
BIENSTOCK	Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -

BIENSTOCK	Yes, Sue?  What is it?
SUE	I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
BIENSTOCK	All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!

BIENSTOCK	I beg your pardon.
SUE	All right, girls - from the top again.

SUE	You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
BIENSTOCK	Funny?  In what way?
SUE	I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.

BIENSTOCK	You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
JERRY	Thank you ever so.
BIENSTOCK	You're welcome.
JERRY	It's entirely mutual.

BIENSTOCK	Upsy-daisy.
JERRY	Fresh!

JERRY	No --- how does it go?
BIENSTOCK	Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.

JERRY	Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?

BIENSTOCK	You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
JERRY	A what?
BIENSTOCK	My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.

DOLORES	This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
JERRY	It's private.  Go away.

DOLORES	Okay. 
JERRY	Manhattans?  This time of night?

DOLORES	- so the one-legged jockey said - 
JERRY	What did he say?
DOLORES	The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'

JERRY	Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
DOLORES	Hey, she's ticklish!

FIRST HENCHMAN	Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
SPATS	Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
FIRST HENCHMAN	He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
SPATS	Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.

SPATS	Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
FIRST HENCHMAN	Those two musicians from the garage!
SPATS	They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.

SPATS	What happened?
FIRST HENCHMAN	Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
SPATS	Where were you guys?

JERRY	Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
JOE	I'll say.
JERRY	I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
JOE	Yeah.  Why?

JERRY	Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
JOE	Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
JERRY	It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
JOE	How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
JERRY	You're right, Joe.
JOE	Of course I am.
JERRY	First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
JOE	No we're not.
JERRY	We're not?
JOE	First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
JERRY	You're going to bet my money on a dog?
JOE	He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
JERRY	What are you giving me with the rabbit?
JOE	Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
JERRY	But suppose he loses?
JOE	What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
JERRY	But suppose it doesn't?
JOE	Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?

JOE	Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
JERRY	Hey, Joe!
JOE	Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
JERRY	Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!

JERRY	Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
JOE	Quiet - I'm thinking.
JERRY	Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
JOE	Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
JERRY	Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
JOE	I told you - it's a sure thing.
JERRY	But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
JOE	Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!

JERRY	Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
JOE	I thought you weren't talking to me.
JERRY	Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.

JERRY	Yeah - where were you?
JOE	With you.
JERRY	With me?
JOE	Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
JERRY	It did?  Boy, did it ever!
JOE	So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
JERRY	Right.  We have the same blood type...
JOE	- Type O.

JOE	Nellie told us about it.
JERRY	We're not too late, are we?

JERRY	You mean it's a girls' band?
JOE	Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!

JOE	No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
JERRY	But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
JOE	You've flipped your wig!
JERRY	Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
JOE	Josephine and Geraldine!  Come on!

JERRY	All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
JOE	It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.

JERRY	It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
JOE	I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.

JERRY	We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
JOE	Knock it off, will you?

JOE	We didn't see anything -  - did we?
JERRY	No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -

JERRY	I think they got me.
JOE	They got the bull-fiddle.
JERRY	You don't see any blood?
JOE	Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.

JERRY	Where are we running, Joe?
JOE	As far away as possible.
JERRY	That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -

JERRY	You going to call the police?
JOE	The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
JERRY	We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
JOE	We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
JERRY	Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
JOE	Shave our legs, stupid.

JERRY	How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
JOE	Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.

JERRY	And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
JOE	Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
JERRY	I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
JOE	With those legs?  Are you crazy?

JERRY	It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
JOE	The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.

JERRY	Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
JOE	What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
JERRY	This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...

JOE	My name is Josephine.
JERRY	And I'm Daphne.

JOE	DAPHNE?
JERRY	I never did like the name Geraldine.

JERRY	Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
JOE	I'm Josephine.  Sax.

JERRY	How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
JOE	Watch it, Daphne!
JERRY	When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
JOE	Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!

JOE	Not there - that's the emergency brake.
JERRY	Now you've done it!
JOE	Done what?
JERRY	Tore off one of my chests.
JOE	You'd better go fix it.
JERRY	You better come help me.

JOE	This way, Daphne.
JERRY	Now you tore the other one.

JOE	I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
JERRY	Polish?

JERRY	Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
JOE	Down, Daphne!
JERRY	How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?

JOE	Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
JERRY	Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
JOE	Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
JERRY	You tore it again!

JERRY	Men?
JOE	Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
JERRY	We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.

JOE	Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
JERRY	I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -

JERRY	What are you doing?
JOE	I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
JERRY	But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
JOE	Fight it.
JERRY	But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
JOE	Then pull the emergency brake!

JOE	Good night, Daphne.
JERRY	Good night, Josephine.

JOE	What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
JERRY	It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
JOE	Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!

JOE	Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
JERRY	You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?

JOE	What happened?
JERRY	I got pinched in the elevator.
JOE	Well, now you know how the other half lives.
JERRY	And I'm not even pretty.
JOE	They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
JERRY	I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
JOE	Blow where?
JERRY	You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
JOE	How can we?  We're broke.
JERRY	We can get a job with another band. A male band.
JOE	Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
JERRY	But this is so humiliating.
JOE	So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
JERRY	All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
JOE	What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
JERRY	What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
JOE	Me?  After Sugar?
JERRY	I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
JOE	What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
JERRY	Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.

JERRY	Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
JOE	Don't get burned, Daphne.

JOE	What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
JERRY	You - you -
JOE	This happens to me all the time in public.

JOE	I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
JERRY	Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.

JERRY	He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
JOE	Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.

JERRY	You know - the old shell game.
JOE	Daphne, you're bothering us.

JOE	Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
JERRY	And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -

JERRY	I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
JOE	Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
JERRY	What message?  What motorboat?
JOE	You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
JERRY	Oh, he does!
JOE	Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
JERRY	Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
JOE	Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
JERRY	You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
JOE	No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
JERRY	And where's he going to be?
JOE	He's going to be ashore with you.
JERRY	With ME?
JOE	That's right.
JERRY	Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!

JOE	Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
JERRY	You can both go take a flying jump.
JOE	Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.

JOE	Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
JERRY	Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
JOE	Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
JERRY	Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
JOE	Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
JERRY	Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

JERRY	What are you doing with my flowers?
JOE	I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.

JOE	Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
JERRY	Have I got things to tell you!
JOE	What happened?
JERRY	I'm engaged.
JOE	Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
JERRY	I am.
JOE	WHAT?
JERRY	Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
JOE	What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
JERRY	You think he's too old for me?
JOE	Jerry!  You can't be serious!
JERRY	Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
JOE	But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
JERRY	Security.
JOE	Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
JERRY	Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
JOE	I'll say there is!
JERRY	His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
JOE	Jerry - there's another problem.
JERRY	Like what?
JOE	Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
JERRY	We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
JOE	You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
JERRY	Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
JOE	Like when?
JERRY	Like right after the ceremony.
JOE	Oh.
JERRY	Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
JOE	Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
JERRY	But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
JOE	Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
JERRY	I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
JOE	What engagement present?

JOE	Hey - these are real diamonds.
JERRY	Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
JOE	Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.

JERRY	That's some nerve!
JOE	Daphne got a proposal tonight.

JERRY	I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
JOE	Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?

JERRY	It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
JOE	So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
JERRY	What are you giving me with the omelette?
JOE	Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
JERRY	Joe -
JOE	What?

JERRY	I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
JOE	Shut up and keep packing.
JERRY	Okay, Joe.

JOE	Not that, you idiot.
JERRY	But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.

JERRY	Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
JOE	There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
JERRY	Sugar?
JOE	Get me Room 414.
JERRY	What do you think you're doing?

JERRY	Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
JOE	We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
JERRY	Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
JOE	That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
JERRY	Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
JOE	Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.

JOE	Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
JERRY	I may throw up.

JERRY	I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
JOE	Yeah - lets shove off.

JERRY	Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
JOE	What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
JERRY	All right. What happened to our bracelet?
JOE	Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
JERRY	What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
JOE	No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.

JERRY	You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
JOE	We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
JERRY	There you go with that we again.

JERRY	All right - so what do we do now?
JOE	First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.

JERRY	Did you hear that?
JOE	Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.

JERRY	What'll I tell him?
JOE	Tell him you're going to elope with him.
JERRY	Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
JOE	There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.

JERRY	It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
JOE	We're not on the pier yet -

SUGAR	OH!
JERRY	Terribly sorry.
SUGAR	That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?

JERRY	That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
SUGAR	I'm Sugar Cane.

JERRY	She sings, too.
SUGAR	I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.

JERRY	We'll take a rain check.
SUGAR	I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.

SUGAR	Are my seams straight?
JERRY	I'll say.
SUGAR	See you around, girls.

JERRY	Good night, Sugar.
SUGAR	Good night, honey.
JERRY	Honey - she called me honey.

JERRY	Oh - Sugar!
SUGAR	I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
JERRY	It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
SUGAR	If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
JERRY	It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
SUGAR	If there's anything I can do for you -
JERRY	Oh, I can think of a million things -

JERRY	And that's one of them.
SUGAR	Sssh.  Sweet Sue.

SUGAR	I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
JERRY	We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
SUGAR	I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
JERRY	Stay as long as you'd like.
SUGAR	I'm not crowding you, am I?
JERRY	No.  It's nice and cozy.
SUGAR	When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
JERRY	Interesting.
SUGAR	Anything wrong?
JERRY	No, no.
SUGAR	Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
JERRY	That's ridiculous.
SUGAR	And your head is hot.
JERRY	That's ridiculous.
SUGAR	And you've got cold feet.
JERRY	Isn't that ridiculous?
SUGAR	Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?

JERRY	I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
SUGAR	What did you say?
JERRY	I'm a very sick girl.
SUGAR	Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
JERRY	I'm not that sick.
SUGAR	I have a very low resistance.
JERRY	Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
SUGAR	You got some?
JERRY	I know where to get some.  Don't move.

SUGAR	You all right?
JERRY	I'm fine.
SUGAR	How's the bottle?
JERRY	Half-full.

JERRY	I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
SUGAR	You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
JERRY	No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
SUGAR	I may spill something.
JERRY	So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
SUGAR	What's the surprise?
JERRY	Uh-uh.  Not yet.
SUGAR	When?
JERRY	We better have a drink first.
SUGAR	Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
JERRY	No fair guessing.

JERRY	Who needs vermouth?
SUGAR	We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.

SUGAR	And bring the cocktail shaker.
JERRY	Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.

JERRY	Not you, Sugar.
SUGAR	I'm just going to get some ice.

JERRY	I'll carry the instruments.
SUGAR	Thank you, Daphne.

JERRY	Here you are, Sugar.
SUGAR	A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
JERRY	You betcha.

JERRY	See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
SUGAR	We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?

SUGAR	Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
JERRY	She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.

SUGAR	What do you think you're doing?
JERRY	Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.

SUGAR	You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
JERRY	You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
SUGAR	I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
JERRY	That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
SUGAR	But there's one thing I envy you for.
JERRY	What's that?
SUGAR	You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.

JERRY	Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
SUGAR	Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
JERRY	Okay.

SUGAR	I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
JERRY	Vanity Fair?

JERRY	His yacht?
SUGAR	It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
JERRY	I'm a what?
SUGAR	Or was it Bryn Mawr?

JERRY	Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
SUGAR	Come on, Daphne.

JERRY	Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
SUGAR	Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
JERRY	Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
SUGAR	If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
JERRY	Yeah - Josephine.
SUGAR	Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
JERRY	Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.

SUGAR	We don't have to run.
JERRY	Oh yes, we do!

JERRY	Josephine -
SUGAR	I guess she's not in here.
JERRY	That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
SUGAR	Well, I'll come back later.
JERRY	No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
SUGAR	Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
JERRY	Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
SUGAR	Do you suppose she went out shopping?
JERRY	That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.

JERRY	Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
SUGAR	I met one of them.

JERRY	What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
SUGAR	I hope so.
JERRY	What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?

JERRY	No!
SUGAR	Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
JERRY	No!
SUGAR	Yes.

SUGAR	I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
JERRY	I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.

JERRY	Did he get fresh?
SUGAR	Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
JERRY	What for?
SUGAR	And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.

JERRY	How did you get that bracelet?
SUGAR	You like it?
JERRY	I always did.
SUGAR	Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
JERRY	Thirty-four.
SUGAR	He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
JERRY	That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.

JERRY	Brand new.
SUE	This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.

SUE	Where did you girls play before?
JERRY	Oh - here and there - and around.

SUE	How did those holes get there?
JERRY	Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?

SUE	Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
JERRY	Yes.  For a whole year.
SUE	I thought you said three years.

JERRY	I was it.
SUE	What's the big idea?
JERRY	I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare.  Something I ate.  I'm not at all well.  See?  Hot water bottle.

JERRY	It's about the Florida job.
POLIAKOFF	The Florida job?

JERRY	What's wrong with us?
POLIAKOFF	You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.

JERRY	We could pass for that.
POLIAKOFF	- you got to be blonde -
JERRY	We could dye our hair.
POLIAKOFF	- and you got to be girls.
JERRY	We could -

POLIAKOFF	Yes, I'm holding on.
JERRY	Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
POLIAKOFF	What's with him - he drinks?

POLIAKOFF	Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
JERRY	Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -

OSGOOD	Just a moment, miss -  May I?
JERRY	Help yourself.
OSGOOD	I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
JERRY	I am Cinderella the Second.

OSGOOD	If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
JERRY	Me too.  Bye now.
OSGOOD	Let me carry one of the instruments.
JERRY	Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?

OSGOOD	It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
JERRY	Personally, I'm Type O.
OSGOOD	You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
JERRY	You don't say.
OSGOOD	Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
JERRY	You invest in shows?
OSGOOD	No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
JERRY	You're not sure?
OSGOOD	Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
JERRY	I'm not surprised.
OSGOOD	So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
JERRY	Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.

OSGOOD	If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
JERRY	Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
OSGOOD	Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
JERRY	Bull fiddle.
OSGOOD	Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
JERRY	Most of the time I slap it.
OSGOOD	You must be quite a girl.
JERRY	Wanna bet?
OSGOOD	My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
JERRY	Why?
OSGOOD	She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

JERRY	Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
OSGOOD	Goodbye?
JERRY	This is where I get off.
OSGOOD	Oh, you don't get off that easy.

OSGOOD	Please.  It won't happen again.
JERRY	No, thank you.  I'll walk.

OSGOOD	But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
JERRY	I'll throw up!
OSGOOD	Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -

JERRY	Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
OSGOOD	Who?
JERRY	About that roadhouse -
OSGOOD	They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
JERRY	You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
OSGOOD	You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.

OSGOOD	Daphne...
JERRY	Yes, Osgood?
OSGOOD	You're leading again.
JERRY	Sorry.

JERRY	This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
OSGOOD	Pleased to meet you.
JERRY	Come one!

OSGOOD	Another bridesmaid?
JERRY	Flower girl.

OSGOOD	I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
JERRY	Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
OSGOOD	We can have it altered.
JERRY	Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
OSGOOD	Why not?
JERRY	Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
OSGOOD	It doesn't matter.
JERRY	And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
OSGOOD	I don't care.
JERRY	And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
OSGOOD	I forgive you.
JERRY	And I can never have children.
OSGOOD	We'll adopt some.
JERRY	But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
OSGOOD	Well - nobody's perfect.

JOE	This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?
OSGOOD	Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
JOE	Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?

OSGOOD	The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
JOE	Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
OSGOOD	Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
JOE	That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.

SPATS	Don't I know you two from somewhere?
JOE	We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
SPATS	Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
JOE	To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
SPATS	You ain't going nowhere.

SPATS	I don't like no witnesses.
JOE	We won't breathe a word.
SPATS	You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.

SPATS	I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
JOE	Oh, no!

JOE	Anything today?
NELLIE	Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
JOE	Thank you.

JOE	Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
NELLIE	What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?

NELLIE	Oh?
JOE	Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
NELLIE	You're making it up pretty good so far.
JOE	The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -

JOE	What's the job?
NELLIE	It's three weeks in Florida -

JOE	Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
NELLIE	Why?
JOE	Because I got some plans -
NELLIE	I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
JOE	And you'll be in all evening?
NELLIE	Yes, Joe.
JOE	Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
NELLIE	My car?  Why, you -

JOE	Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
POLIAKOFF	Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?

POLIAKOFF	What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
JOE	You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
POLIAKOFF	The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.

JOE	The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
POLIAKOFF	It's not the backs that worry me.
JOE	What kind of band is this, anyway?
POLIAKOFF	You got to be under twenty-five -

JOE	No, we couldn't!
POLIAKOFF	William Morris!

POLIAKOFF	Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
JOE	We'll take it!
POLIAKOFF	You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -

JOE	Well, here we are.
SUE	You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
JOE	Yes, we're the new girls.

SUE	Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
JOE	No - funerals.
SUE	Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.

JOE	We got it second-hand.
SUE	All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?

JOE	We got time off for good behavior.
SUE	There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.

JOE	Tell what?
SUGAR	If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?

SUGAR	Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
JOE	Where did he conduct?
SUGAR	On the Baltimore and Ohio.
JOE	Oh.
SUGAR	I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.

JOE	Running away?  From what?
SUGAR	Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.

JOE	We understand.
SUGAR	All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

SUGAR	Put it here.
JOE	Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
SUGAR	Better keep a lookout.

JOE	If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
SUGAR	I'm not very bright, I guess.
JOE	I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
SUGAR	No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
JOE	Then why did you take this job?
SUGAR	I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
JOE	Afford it?
SUGAR	Have you ever been with a male band?
JOE	Me?
SUGAR	That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
JOE	Rough?
SUGAR	I'll say.
JOE	You can't trust those guys.
SUGAR	I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
JOE	Bingo?
SUGAR	You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
JOE	Really?
SUGAR	Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
JOE	That so?
SUGAR	Every time!
JOE	You know - I play tenor sax.
SUGAR	But you're a girl, thank goodness.
JOE	Yeah.
SUGAR	That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
JOE	Yeah.
SUGAR	You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
JOE	You don't say?
SUGAR	Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
JOE	Men!
SUGAR	So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
JOE	Brains aren't everything.
SUGAR	I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

SUGAR	You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
JOE	You are?
SUGAR	That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
JOE	About what?
SUGAR	About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
JOE	What's in Florida?
SUGAR	Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
JOE	Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
SUGAR	Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
JOE	You're entitled.
SUGAR	Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
JOE	Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
SUGAR	I want mine to wear glasses.
JOE	Glasses?
SUGAR	Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
JOE	Well, now that you've mentioned it -
SUGAR	They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.

SUGAR	Happy days.
JOE	I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.

SUGAR	What's happened?
JOE	Search me.  I mean - I'll see.

JOE	Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
SUGAR	I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
JOE	Why not?
SUGAR	Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
JOE	Want to switch berths with me?
SUGAR	Would you mind terribly?
JOE	Not at all.

SUGAR	Thanks, honey.
JOE	Good night, Sugar.

JOE	Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
SUGAR	I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
JOE	Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.

SUGAR	I wish they'd put us in the same room.
JOE	So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.

SUGAR	414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
JOE	Saxophone player?
SUGAR	What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
JOE	Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
SUGAR	What makes you so sure?
JOE	Just my feminine intuition.

JOE	Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
SUGAR	She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.

JOE	Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
SUGAR	My fault.
JOE	You're not hurt, are you?
SUGAR	I don't think so.
JOE	I wish you'd make sure.
SUGAR	Why?
JOE	Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
SUGAR	Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
JOE	Thank you.
SUGAR	Who are you?
JOE	Now, really -

SUGAR	Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
JOE	Not very likely.
SUGAR	Are you staying at the hotel?
JOE	Not at all.
SUGAR	Your face is familiar.
JOE	Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
SUGAR	That must be it.
JOE	Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
SUGAR	Your view of what?
JOE	They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
SUGAR	You have a yacht?

SUGAR	Which one is yours - the big one?
JOE	Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
SUGAR	I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
JOE	No, my flag steward.
SUGAR	And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
JOE	No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
SUGAR	I'm not interested at all.
JOE	Well, I'm not.
SUGAR	That's very interesting.

SUGAR	How's the stock market?
JOE	Up, up, up.
SUGAR	I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
JOE	Could be.  Do you play the market?
SUGAR	No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
JOE	For your own amusement?
SUGAR	Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
JOE	You're society girls?
SUGAR	Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
JOE	Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
SUGAR	Yeah.  Real hot.
JOE	Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
SUGAR	So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
JOE	Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
SUGAR	They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
JOE	- Inauguration balls -
SUGAR	- opening of the Opera -
JOE	- riding to hounds -
SUGAR	- and always the same Four Hundred.
JOE	You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
SUGAR	You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
JOE	I beg your pardon?
SUGAR	You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
JOE	What theory?
SUGAR	Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
JOE	Tonight?
SUGAR	I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
JOE	I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
SUGAR	Why?
JOE	I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
SUGAR	Oh?
JOE	It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
SUGAR	You collect shells?
JOE	Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
SUGAR	Shell Oil?
JOE	Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.

JOE	Would you mind moving along, please?
SUGAR	Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

SUGAR	Well, I guess I'd better go -
JOE	It's been delightful meeting you both.
SUGAR	And you will come to hear us tonight?
JOE	If it's at all possible -

SUGAR	Josephine.
JOE	Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

SUGAR	The most wonderful thing happened -
JOE	What?
SUGAR	Guess!
JOE	They repealed Prohibition?

JOE	One of whom?
SUGAR	Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
JOE	You don't say!

SUGAR	Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
JOE	Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
SUGAR	Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
JOE	Shells?  Whatever for?

SUGAR	Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
JOE	I am?
SUGAR	Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.

SUGAR	I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
JOE	Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
SUGAR	For me?  It's Shell Oil.

JOE	You heard her - yes.
SUGAR	Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -

SUGAR	Been waiting long?
JOE	It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.

SUGAR	Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
JOE	I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
SUGAR	It's the thought that counts.

JOE	I seem to be out of gas.
SUGAR	It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -

JOE	I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
SUGAR	Looks like they're on the wrong track.
JOE	Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
SUGAR	It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.

SUGAR	It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
JOE	Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
SUGAR	Three?
JOE	Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
SUGAR	My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
JOE	Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
SUGAR	Love it.  Which way?
JOE	Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?

SUGAR	Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
JOE	Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.

SUGAR	Oh - in here.
JOE	Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.

SUGAR	It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
JOE	It's all right for a bachelor.
SUGAR	What a beautiful fish.
JOE	Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
SUGAR	What is it?
JOE	Oh - a member of the herring family.
SUGAR	A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
JOE	They shrink when they're marinated.

JOE	Champagne?
SUGAR	I don't mind if I do.
JOE	Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
SUGAR	Bon voyage.

SUGAR	Look at all that silverware.
JOE	Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
SUGAR	Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
JOE	I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
SUGAR	Where's your shell collection?
JOE	Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
SUGAR	What's on Thursdays?
JOE	It's the crews' night off.
SUGAR	You mean we're alone on the boat?
JOE	Completely.
SUGAR	You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
JOE	Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
SUGAR	It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
JOE	You're flattering me.
SUGAR	Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
JOE	Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
SUGAR	Harmless - how?
JOE	Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
SUGAR	What thing?
JOE	They just sort of leave me cold.
SUGAR	You mean - like frigid?
JOE	It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
SUGAR	Have you tried?
JOE	Have I?  I'm trying all the time.

JOE	See?  Nothing.
SUGAR	Nothing at all?
JOE	Complete washout.
SUGAR	That makes me feel just awful.
JOE	Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
SUGAR	You mean you can't fall in love?
JOE	Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
SUGAR	What happened?
JOE	I don't want to bore you.
SUGAR	Oh, you couldn't possibly.
JOE	Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
SUGAR	Oh, no!
JOE	Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
SUGAR	Talk about sad.
JOE	Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
SUGAR	You poor, poor boy.
JOE	Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
SUGAR	How can you think about food at a time like this?
JOE	What else is there for me? 
SUGAR	Is it that hopeless?
JOE	My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
SUGAR	Have you ever tried American girls?
JOE	Why?

SUGAR	Is that anything?
JOE	Thanks just the same.

SUGAR	Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
JOE	I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
SUGAR	Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
JOE	If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.

SUGAR	Would you do me a favor?
JOE	What is it?
SUGAR	I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
JOE	All right - if you insist.

SUGAR	Anything this time?
JOE	I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
SUGAR	Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
JOE	Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.

SUGAR	You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
JOE	It's like smoking without inhaling.
SUGAR	So inhale!

SUGAR	Well - ?
JOE	I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.

JOE	I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
SUGAR	Lets throw another log on the fire.

JOE	I think you're on the right track.
SUGAR	I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.

JOE	I never knew it could be like this.
SUGAR	Thank you.
JOE	They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
SUGAR	Mineral baths - now really!
JOE	Where did you learn to kiss like that?
SUGAR	Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

JOE	Good night.
SUGAR	Good morning.
JOE	How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
SUGAR	Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
JOE	Let's make it an even million.

SUGAR	Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
JOE	Did you have a nice time?
SUGAR	Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.

JOE	Gee, I wish I'd been there.
SUGAR	I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.

SUGAR	Really?
SUGAR	From a rich millionaire.
SUGAR	That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
JOE	Me?
SUGAR	Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.

SUGAR	That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
JOE	Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
SUGAR	I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
JOE	I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
SUGAR	Tomorrow night?
JOE	Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
SUGAR	Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
JOE	You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
SUGAR	A merger?  How long will you be gone?
JOE	Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
SUGAR	You're not?
JOE	It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
SUGAR	Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
JOE	According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
SUGAR	Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
JOE	I knew you would.

JOE	I only wish there were something I could do for you.
SUGAR	But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
JOE	Smart move.  Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.

SUGAR	Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?
JOE	What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
SUGAR	Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
JOE	Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
SUGAR	I didn't do anything.  It just happened.

JOE	Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
SUGAR	Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
JOE	Goodbye, my darling.

JOE	What's the matter, Sugar?
SUGAR	I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.

JOE	Daphne -
SUGAR	He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
JOE	You'll forget him, Sugar.
SUGAR	How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.

JOE	Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
SUGAR	I told you - I'm not very bright.

JOE	You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
SUGAR	I know.  Every time!
JOE	Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
SUGAR	That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.

MOZARELLA	Good evening, sir.
MULLIGAN	I come to the old lady's funeral.
MOZARELLA	I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
MULLIGAN	That's because I've been on the wagon.
MOZARELLA	PLEASE!
MULLIGAN	Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
MOZARELLA	Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.

WAITER	What'll it be, sir?
MULLIGAN	Booze.
WAITER	Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
MULLIGAN	Coffee?
WAITER	Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
MULLIGAN	Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.

MULLIGAN	Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
WAITER	Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.

MULLIGAN	Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
WAITER	Who's going to raid a funeral?
MULLIGAN	Some people got no respect for the dead.

MULLIGAN	Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
SPATS	Go where?
MULLIGAN	A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
SPATS	I never join nothin'.
MULLIGAN	You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
SPATS	Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
MULLIGAN	Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
SPATS	Me?  I'm just a customer here.
MULLIGAN	Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
SPATS	Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
MULLIGAN	We got different information.
SPATS	From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
MULLIGAN	Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.

SPATS	You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
MULLIGAN	If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
SPATS	These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.

MULLIGAN	Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
SPATS	Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
MULLIGAN	I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
SPATS	Big joke!
MULLIGAN	Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
SPATS	Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
MULLIGAN	What's his first name?  And where does he live?
SPATS	That's an opera, you ignoramus.
MULLIGAN	Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
SPATS	Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
MULLIGAN	Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
SPATS	Why?
MULLIGAN	Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
SPATS	I cut myself shaving.
MULLIGAN	You shave with your spats on?
SPATS	I sleep with my spats on.
MULLIGAN	Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
SPATS	You and who else?
MULLIGAN	Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
SPATS	You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?

MULLIGAN	All right, Charlie - this the joint?
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	Yes, sir.
MULLIGAN	And who runs it?
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	I already told you.
MULLIGAN	Refresh my memory.
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	Spats Colombo.
MULLIGAN	That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
MULLIGAN	Thanks, Charlie.
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
MULLIGAN	Okay, Charlie.

TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
MULLIGAN	Goodbye, Charlie.

PARADISE	Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
SPATS	Why wouldn't I?
PARADISE	We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
SPATS	Well, we all got to go sometime.
PARADISE	Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
SPATS	What for?
PARADISE	Orders from Little Bonaparte.

SPATS	Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
SPATS	Just dropped in to pay my respects.
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	You don't owe me no nothing.
SPATS	Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...

TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	I don't know what you're talking about.
SPATS	So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.

SPATS	Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
TOOTHPICK CHARLIE	No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!

THE MOLE	Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
CARTMAN	Okay.

CARTMAN	I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!

THE MOLE	Ze alarms! Zey went off!

CARTMAN	Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
KYLE	Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
CARTMAN	Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.

CARTMAN	How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
KYLE	Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
CARTMAN	Oh.

KYLE	Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
CARTMAN	You bet your fucking ass it was!

KYLE	Dude, how can you hate the environment?
CARTMAN	'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

KYLE	I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
CARTMAN	It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!

KYLE	Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
CARTMAN	Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.

CARTMAN	I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
KYLE	Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
CARTMAN	No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
KYLE	Oh.

KYLE	I can't believe he's dead.
CARTMAN	Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...

KYLE	Who the hell made up that law?!
CARTMAN	You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.

KYLE	But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
CARTMAN	Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?

CARTMAN	WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
KYLE	Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!

KYLE	Hey Cartman.
CARTMAN	What?
KYLE	You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
CARTMAN	Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

CARTMAN	This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
KYLE	And she's getting worse...

CARTMAN	Come on, just get to the message board!
KYLE	I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...

KYLE	Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
CARTMAN	Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
KYLE	We're not gonna have pie and punch!
CARTMAN	More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
KYLE	pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...

KYLE	You're late, Cartman!
CARTMAN	I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
KYLE	Your behind?
CARTMAN	I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
KYLE	Did you bring the pie and punch?
CARTMAN	No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.

KYLE	I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Look, Eric it's your little friends.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
CARTMAN	But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!

CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Goodnight, honey.
CARTMAN	Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER	I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
CARTMAN	Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Oh.

CARTMAN	Mom...
CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Yes, hon?
CARTMAN	If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Sure, hon. Goodnight.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
CARTMAN	I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!

CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
CARTMAN	I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!

CARTMAN	Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
MR. MACKEY	Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.

CARTMAN	You've got a stupid accent too.
MR. MACKEY	Eric, that is not appropriate.
CARTMAN	What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
MR. MACKEY	Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.

MR. MACKEY	Mkay.
CARTMAN	God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.

MR. MACKEY	So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
CARTMAN	Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
MR. MACKEY	Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
CARTMAN	You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
MR. MACKEY	Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
CARTMAN	Help yourself prickfuck!
MR. MACKEY	I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!

CARTMAN	Thank God, that sucked ass.
MR. MACKEY	Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
CARTMAN	The N word?
MR. MACKEY	Norwegian Ass Raper.
CARTMAN	Oh yeah.
MR. MACKEY	The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.

MR. MACKEY	Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
CARTMAN	HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
MR. MACKEY	No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...

CARTMAN'S MOTHER	What?
KYLE'S MOTHER	Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!

CARTMAN'S MOTHER	You bastards.
KYLE'S MOTHER	This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>

KYLE'S MOTHER	What was that word, young man!?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
KYLE'S MOTHER	I know what it is!

KYLE'S MOTHER	Kyle?!
CARTMAN'S MOTHER	Eric?

KYLE	We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
CHEF	A hunger strike? For what?

CHEF	Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
KYLE	I don't know.
CHEF	Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.

KYLE	What's going on, Chef?
CHEF	Something big, children.

KYLE	Look at that!
CHEF	It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!

CHEF	Hello there, children!!
STAN	Hey, Chef.
CHEF	How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?

STAN	What's the secret to making a woman happy?
CHEF	Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
STAN	Huh?

CHEF	Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
STAN	No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?

STAN	Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
CHEF	It's... It's not good children.

STAN	Who are you, kid?
GREGORY	My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.

GREGORY	Viva la Resistance.
STAN	Oh no, it's that kid.
GREGORY	This is the place--

GREGORY	May I?
STAN	What?

STAN	WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
GREGORY	This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?

KYLE'S MOTHER	Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
KYLE	Aw, ma!!
KYLE'S MOTHER	Do as I say, Kyle!

KYLE'S MOTHER	Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
KYLE	Dude, what the hell is going on?

KYLE'S MOTHER	Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
KYLE	We already know what you did. We saw it on television.

KYLE	What's that?
KYLE'S MOTHER	You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.

KYLE'S MOTHER	No... The General is right.
KYLE	MOM!!!
KYLE'S MOTHER	Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.

KYLE	Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
THE MOLE	No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
KYLE	That's gonna take a long time!
THE MOLE	Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?

KYLE	Dude, we don't have watches.
THE MOLE	Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?

KYLE	What's a butfor?
THE MOLE	For pooping, silly.

THE MOLE	Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
KYLE	What's a dying giraffe sound like?
THE MOLE	Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
KYLE	Kay.

KYLE	Be careful, dude.
THE MOLE	Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?

STAN	This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
KYLE	We HAVE to see this movie, dude!

KYLE	That was sweet!
STAN	Where do they come up with this stuff?!

STAN	<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
KYLE	Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.

KYLE	Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
STAN	She's not my girlfriend, dude!

STAN	Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
KYLE	Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!

STAN	Nowhere.
KYLE	I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
STAN	Yeah!

KYLE	Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
STAN	Yeah...

STAN	OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
KYLE	YOU BASTARD!!

STAN	Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
KYLE	You bastards!!

STAN	How can they do this?
KYLE	It isn't fair!

STAN	Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
KYLE	Our moms suck!

KYLE	Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
STAN	How do we do that?

STAN	What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
KYLE	I don't know, dude.
STAN	That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
KYLE	I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
STAN	She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!

KYLE	Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
STAN	I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
KYLE	Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.

KYLE	Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
STAN	What's the difference?

KYLE	Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
STAN	Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!

KYLE	This is sweet!!
STAN	Totally!

STAN	I'm so sick of these soldiers.
KYLE	Yeah, they suck.

KYLE	Does it say what the clitoris is?
STAN	All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
KYLE	Isn't that in Arizona or something?

KYLE	It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
STAN	What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-

KYLE	I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
STAN	I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>

KYLE	Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
STAN	Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
KYLE	Okay...

KYLE	Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris!
STAN	Wow!
KYLE	I'll just try the first one.

STAN	Dude, do you know what you're doing?
KYLE	No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.

KYLE	Wow, a lot of people showed up.
STAN	Yeah, so what do we say?
KYLE	I thought you had something planned.
STAN	Me?!

STAN	Oh, brother.
KYLE	Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?

KYLE	Stan!
STAN	Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
KYLE	Sweet.

KYLE	WHAT?
STAN	Are you sure, Kenny?

KYLE	Thank you, Kenny.
STAN	Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.

KYLE	Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
STAN	Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.

STAN	Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
KYLE	Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-

STAN'S MOTHER	Oh dear God...
KYLE'S MOTHER	What is 'fisting'?

KYLE'S MOTHER	I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
STAN'S MOTHER	He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.

STAN'S MOTHER	Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
KYLE'S MOTHER	YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!

STAN'S MOTHER	Oh Lord, what have we done...?
KYLE'S MOTHER	Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?

KYLE'S MOTHER	WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
STAN'S MOTHER	We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!

KYLE'S MOTHER	Shiteater-
STAN'S MOTHER	-Or monkey fucker-

KYLE'S MOTHER	My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
PRESIDENT	As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
KYLE'S MOTHER	What about air strikes?
PRESIDENT	Huh?
KYLE'S MOTHER	We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
PRESIDENT	Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
KYLE'S MOTHER	Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!

PRESIDENT	Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
KYLE'S MOTHER	Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
PRESIDENT	Yes ma'am!

KYLE'S MOTHER	And Bill?
PRESIDENT	Yes?
KYLE'S MOTHER	I'm needing lunch.
PRESIDENT	Right away, ma'am!

SATAN	You're all part of Satan's army now!
KYLE'S MOTHER	What the hell is going on?!

SATAN	I am the dark master!
KYLE'S MOTHER	Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
SATAN	SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
KYLE'S MOTHER	Oh.
SATAN	YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!

SATAN	Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
KYLE'S MOTHER	And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
SATAN	SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
KYLE'S MOTHER	Oh God... What have I done...

KYLE'S MOTHER	What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	No, it was worse than that...
KYLE'S MOTHER	The F word?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.

KYLE'S MOTHER	Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	What is Terrance and Phillip?
KYLE'S MOTHER	Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.

KYLE'S MOTHER	We must take action on this immediately.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
KYLE'S MOTHER	Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
KYLE'S MOTHER	Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	But I-
KYLE'S MOTHER	You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!

MR. MACKEY	Uh, we're just, starting our program...
KYLE'S MOTHER	This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!

KYLE'S MOTHER	How is the children's progress?
MR. MACKEY	Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
KYLE'S MOTHER	What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
MR. MACKEY	Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
KYLE'S MOTHER	Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.

MR. MACKEY	Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
KYLE'S MOTHER	I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
MR. MACKEY	Alright, I'll make the call...

PHILLIP	What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
TERRANCE	Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
PHILLIP	Oh yeah!

TERRANCE	Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
PHILLIP	A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?

TERRANCE	It's from your mother.
PHILLIP	My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
TERRANCE	It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'

TERRANCE	You'd fuck your uncle!
PHILLIP	YOU'D fuck your uncle!
TERRANCE	<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
PHILLIP	<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>

TERRANCE	Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
PHILLIP	I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!

TERRANCE	Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
PHILLIP	You bet, Terrance!

PHILLIP	HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
TERRANCE	I sure did, Phillip!!

PHILLIP	Hello, Conan!
TERRANCE	Hello, Brooke Shields!

TERRANCE	Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
PHILLIP	Cheers, Terrance!

TERRANCE	Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
PHILLIP	This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
TERRANCE	And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!

PHILLIP	Fight the power!
TERRANCE	The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
PHILLIP	Don't believe the hype!!

TERRANCE	The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
PHILLIP	Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.

TERRANCE	Oh, you are such a maroon!
PHILLIP	You would know, dummy.

TERRANCE	Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
PHILLIP	I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.

TERRANCE	Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
PHILLIP	I know, Terrance. I know.

PHILLIP	What's going on Terrance?
TERRANCE	Canada is saving us!!

PHILLIP	Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
TERRANCE	You did? Just now?

TERRANCE	AGH!
PHILLIP	Terrance! NO!

PHILLIP	You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
TERRANCE	Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!

SADDAM HUSSEIN	Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
SATAN	You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!

SATAN	Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.

SATAN	Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.

SATAN	I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
SATAN	Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey, come here, guy.

SADDAM HUSSEIN	Who's my cream puff?
SATAN	I am.

SADDAM HUSSEIN	You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
SATAN	I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-

SATAN	It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
SATAN	No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.

SADDAM HUSSEIN	Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
SATAN	Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
SATAN	Is sex the only thing that matters to you?

SADDAM HUSSEIN	You know I do.
SATAN	I know.
SADDAM HUSSEIN	So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?

SADDAM HUSSEIN	What did you do today Satan?
SATAN	You don't care.
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
SATAN	Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
SADDAM HUSSEIN	That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
SATAN	Don't call me dumb!
SADDAM HUSSEIN	I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!

SATAN	This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey, relax guy!
SATAN	Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
SADDAM HUSSEIN	I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?

SATAN	<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
SADDAM HUSSEIN	<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>

SATAN	What if I just left?
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.

SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey, I'm missing the party!
SATAN	No! It can't be!

SATAN	I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!

SATAN	No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?

SATAN	Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
SATAN	If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
SATAN	I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!

SATAN	Ow, you're hurting me!
SADDAM HUSSEIN	Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.

SADDAM HUSSEIN	Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
SATAN	THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!

STAN	We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
WENDY	That's nice, Stan.

STAN	Did you see that, Wendy?
WENDY	Yup.

STAN	Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
WENDY	Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
STAN	<u>WHAT?!</u>

STAN	Yeah!
WENDY	This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.

STAN	What the hell are you talking about, kid?
WENDY	You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.

STAN	Hi Wendy.
WENDY	Hi Stan.

WENDY	NAZIS!!
STAN	What's the matter, Wendy?
WENDY	Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
STAN	God damn it, why does she keep saying that?

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Can I have a glass of water?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Certainly - how about some breakfast?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Possibly some coffee?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Moffo!

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Thank you, Admiral.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Don't be ridiculous.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	I have your word, Mister President?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Yes, of course.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Where are you trying to reach him?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	At his office in the Capitol.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Did you get that, Kulnick?

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	What's the meaning of this?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Where is this...thing?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	That's preposterous!  We have no such program!
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Yes?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	How dare you talk to me in this manner?

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	That's nonsense, and you know it!
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	I know nothing of the sort!
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require?  You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Oh, yes, that's right.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Give that back to me.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.

GENERAL SCHMUCK	Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	You mean you'll tell us his name???
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
GENERAL SCHMUCK	See!  See, I told you.

AMBASSADOR DE SADE	My seven body orifices????
GENERAL SCHMUCK	That's right, fella.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE	One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...

COLONEL "BAT" GUANO	Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
COLONEL "BAT" GUANO	Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
COLONEL "BAT" GUANO	What are you talking about, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
COLONEL "BAT" GUANO	Get a grip on yourself, Major!
MAJOR MANDRAKE	It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...

COLONEL "BAT" GUANO	Now, snap out of it, fella!
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Who the hell do you think you are, sir???

COLONEL GUANO	I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, you can't do that because he's dead.

COLONEL GUANO	Do you have any witnesses, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	What?
COLONEL GUANO	What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Look, I didn't shoot him!
COLONEL GUANO	We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
COLONEL GUANO	Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
COLONEL GUANO	Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
COLONEL GUANO	You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Didn't they tell you?
COLONEL GUANO	They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?

COLONEL GUANO	Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
COLONEL GUANO	On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
COLONEL GUANO	You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
COLONEL GUANO	What about the President?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
COLONEL GUANO	So what?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
COLONEL GUANO	That's government property, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.

SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR	I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
COLONEL PUNTRICH	What is your name, young lady?
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR	Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
COLONEL PUNTRICH	What did you say?
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR	Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
COLONEL PUNTRICH	Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.

GENERAL SCHMUCK	Yes!
COLONEL PUNTRICH	General Schmuck?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Yes!  Who the hell is this?

GENERAL SCHMUCK	Go back to sleep, baby.
COLONEL PUNTRICH	What did you say, sir?

GENERAL SCHMUCK	I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
COLONEL PUNTRICH	General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.

GENERAL SCHMUCK	Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
COLONEL PUNTRICH	No, sir.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.

GENERAL SCHMUCK	Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
COLONEL PUNTRICH	I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.

GENERAL SCHMUCK	Does the threat board show anything?
COLONEL PUNTRICH	Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.

GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK	Well, Mister President.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	What kind of trouble?
GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK	Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	General Schmuck?
GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK	Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK	To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	You aren't sure!
GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK	Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK	Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.

GENERAL "BUCK" SCHMUCK	Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.

GENERAL FACEMAN	Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Yes?
GENERAL FACEMAN	Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
GENERAL FACEMAN	Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	That's a very wise deduction, General.
GENERAL FACEMAN	Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
GENERAL FACEMAN	Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
GENERAL FACEMAN	But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
GENERAL FACEMAN	That certainly would be a problem, sir.

GENERAL FACEMAN	I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
GENERAL FACEMAN	Yes, sir.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	This is General Ripper speaking.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Yes, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Do you recognize my voice?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?

GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Why do you think I ask?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	No, sir.

GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Yes, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Condition Red!
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?

GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
MAJOR MANDRAKE	A shooting war!
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Yes, sir.

GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	That's right, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	You're right, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Who do you think you're talking to?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	To you, sir.  But how do I know?
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Are you trying to be insubordinate?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	No, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Plan-R????
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Are you hard of hearing, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Are you questioning my orders, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Thank you, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Yes, sir.
GENERAL JACK D. RIPPER	And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	What's the gun for, General Ripper?
GENERAL RIPPER	Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
GENERAL RIPPER	That's right, Major.

GENERAL RIPPER	I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
GENERAL RIPPER	I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
GENERAL RIPPER	Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
GENERAL RIPPER	That is correct, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
GENERAL RIPPER	You know the regulations well, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
GENERAL RIPPER	That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
GENERAL RIPPER	And if that were true?

MAJOR MANDRAKE	But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
GENERAL RIPPER	Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?

GENERAL RIPPER	Suppose that were the case?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER	Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.

GENERAL RIPPER	Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I know that, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER	We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	I suppose they are, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER	You're damned right they are.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	How much soda, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER	Just a squirt.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	That about right?
GENERAL RIPPER	Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	What shall we drink to, sir?
GENERAL RIPPER	To peace on earth.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	General Ripper, can I ask another question?
GENERAL RIPPER	Ask away, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
GENERAL RIPPER	I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
GENERAL RIPPER	Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I don't think so, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER	He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I see.
GENERAL RIPPER	When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I'm trying to, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER	You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
GENERAL RIPPER	If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
GENERAL RIPPER	That's close enough, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
GENERAL RIPPER	You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't

MAJOR MANDRAKE	I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
GENERAL RIPPER	Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I guess so.
GENERAL RIPPER	I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
GENERAL RIPPER	You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
GENERAL RIPPER	Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Where, sir?
GENERAL RIPPER	Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
GENERAL RIPPER	Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
GENERAL RIPPER	You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Yes, sir.  But so do we.
GENERAL RIPPER	But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
GENERAL RIPPER	But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Right.
GENERAL RIPPER	Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do.  I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 

GENERAL RIPPER	Go on, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
GENERAL RIPPER	I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
MAJOR MANDRAKE	That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
GENERAL RIPPER	Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.

GENERAL RIPPER	I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
GENERAL RIPPER	No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
GENERAL RIPPER	Major, you're talking like one of them!
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
GENERAL RIPPER	Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
GENERAL RIPPER	I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
GENERAL RIPPER	But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
GENERAL RIPPER	And you'd like to see that?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
GENERAL RIPPER	Do you think we'd cheat?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
GENERAL RIPPER	Do you think they would cheat?
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
GENERAL RIPPER	Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.

GENERAL RIPPER	Major, those are my boys out there dying.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?

GENERAL RIPPER	To peace on earth, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE	Peace on earth.

MAJOR MANDRAKE	General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
GENERAL RIPPER	Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.

GENERAL SCHMUCK	It was a honest mistake, sir.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	I presume the planes are armed?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	What the hell is Plan-R?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Why can't you cancel it?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Then there's no chance for recall?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.

GENERAL SCHMUCK	General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	I want to talk to General Ripper.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	But we can't communicate with the base.

GENERAL SCHMUCK	I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Admiral Buldike?

GENERAL SCHMUCK	But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!

GENERAL SCHMUCK	We don't operate like you KGB boys.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	They're coming in now.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	How long will it take to receive them all?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.

GENERAL SCHMUCK	I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	How many planes did we lose?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Naturally I am, sir.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	He says they've only shot down three planes.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Look, he's there, and you're here.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Yes?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Have you tried the recall again?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	What's the target.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
GENERAL SCHMUCK	If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	General, stick to the point, please.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
GENERAL SCHMUCK	Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.

LT. BALLMUFF	Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
MAJOR KONG	No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.

MAJOR KONG	Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
LT. BALLMUFF	Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.

LT. BALLMUFF	I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
MAJOR KONG	Roger. One-three-eight.

LT. BALLMUFF	Roger, maintain.
MAJOR KONG	Lothar, take your checks now.

LT. BALLMUFF	We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
MAJOR KONG	Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
LT. BALLMUFF	I don't think so.

MAJOR KONG	All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
MAJOR KONG	Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
LT. BALLMUFF	You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
MAJOR KONG	Can't help it.  What's the wind like?

LT. ZOGG	What else could it be?
LT. QUIFFER	Maybe it's an exercise.

LT. ZOGG	He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
LT. QUIFFER	They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
LT. ZOGG	He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
LT. QUIFFER	The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the

LT. ZOGG	Maximum ECM.
LT. QUIFFER	Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.

MAJOR KONG	Then this is it.
LT. QUIFFER	What?
MAJOR KONG	War.
LT. QUIFFER	War?

LT. QUIFFER	I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
MAJOR KONG	Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.

MAJOR KONG	A through H is correct.
LT. QUIFFER	Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
MAJOR KONG	Check.
LT. QUIFFER	Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.

MAJOR KONG	Check.
LT. QUIFFER	Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.

LT. QUIFFER	Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
MAJOR KONG	Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.

LT. QUIFFER	Just the missiles.
MAJOR KONG	They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
LT. QUIFFER	Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
MAJOR KONG	Speed?
LT. QUIFFER	Between Mach 3 and 4.
MAJOR KONG	Call them every five miles.
LT. QUIFFER	Thirty-five, still straight.

LT. QUIFFER	Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
MAJOR KONG	Maximum ECM!

LT. QUIFFER	Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
MAJOR KONG	We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.

LT. QUIFFER	Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
MAJOR KONG	Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?

LT. QUIFFER	Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
MAJOR KONG	Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
LT. QUIFFER	Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
MAJOR KONG	Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
LT. QUIFFER	Look, can't someone help me?

MAJOR KONG	Roger.
LT. QUIFFER	Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
MAJOR KONG	They must have made a visual contact.
LT. QUIFFER	Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
MAJOR KONG	They can't touch us at this height.
LT. QUIFFER	They're moving apart.

MAJOR KONG	If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
LT. QUIFFER	I think they mean business.
MAJOR KONG	Hang on, boys.

LT. QUIFFER	Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
MAJOR KONG	Hey, Terry, I'm hit.

LT. QUIFFER	Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
MAJOR KONG	Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
LT. QUIFFER	Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
MAJOR KONG	Sure, I'll take her up right now.

LT. TOEJAM	Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
MAJOR KONG	Yeah?
LT. TOEJAM	I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.

LT. TOEJAM	Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
MAJOR KONG	Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
LT. TOEJAM	That's what I'm doing, and it comes out the same.

MAJOR KONG	No, this looks like the real thing.
LT. TOEJAM	Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.

MAJOR KONG	Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
LT. TOEJAM	Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
MAJOR KONG	Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.

MAJOR KONG	Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
LT. TOEJAM	Ready, Major.

MAJOR KONG	Primary arming switch.
LT. TOEJAM	Primary arming switch.

LT. TOEJAM	I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
MAJOR KONG	Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?

LT. TOEJAM	So am I.
MAJOR KONG	Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
LT. TOEJAM	Where'd they get you?
MAJOR KONG	Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!

MAJOR KONG	What does it look like?
LT. TOEJAM	Some kind of signaling.
MAJOR KONG	No kidding.
LT. TOEJAM	Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.

LT. TOEJAM	Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
MAJOR KONG	Very interesting.

LT. TOEJAM	Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
MAJOR KONG	Forget it.

LT. TOEJAM	Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
MAJOR KONG	Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.

MAJOR KONG	In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
LT. ZOGG	I've got one.
MAJOR KONG	Shoot, Lothar.
LT. ZOGG	Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
MAJOR KONG	That's what I said.
LT. ZOGG	Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
MAJOR KONG	What's your point, Lothar?
LT. ZOGG	Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
MAJOR KONG	Are you saying our order don't make sense?
LT. ZOGG	Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.

MAJOR KONG	Check target approach.
LT. ZOGG	Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
MAJOR KONG	Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
LT. ZOGG	When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
MAJOR KONG	As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?

LT. ZOGG	Primary circuit is live.
MAJOR KONG	Primary trigger switch.

LT. ZOGG	Release first safety.
MAJOR KONG	First safety.

LT. ZOGG	Second safety.
MAJOR KONG	Seond safety.

LT. ZOGG	Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
MAJOR KONG	Check, ten thousand air burst.

LT. ZOGG	Master safety.
MAJOR KONG	Master Kong.

LT. ZOGG	Primary bomb is live.
MAJOR KONG	All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
LT. ZOGG	Master safety on.

MAJOR KONG	Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
LT. ZOGG	Everything still checks out okay.
MAJOR KONG	Binky?

LT. ZOGG	Yes, Major.
MAJOR KONG	Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
LT. ZOGG	Can't "Ace" help you?
MAJOR KONG	He's dead.
LT. ZOGG	What happened?
MAJOR KONG	I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
LT. ZOGG	Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.

LT. ZOGG	Where'd they get you?
MAJOR KONG	In the back...feels like an arrowhead.

LT. ZOGG	How do you know he's dead?
MAJOR KONG	Hell, he looks dead.

LT. ZOGG	He's dead, all right.
MAJOR KONG	Listen, give me a shot quick!

LT. ZOGG	I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
MAJOR KONG	Quentin, how's your gear?

LT. ZOGG	No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
MAJOR KONG	Recall what mistake?
LT. ZOGG	No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?

MAJOR KONG	You sure have to hand it to those guys.
LT. ZOGG	What do you mean?
MAJOR KONG	I mean pulling a stunt like that.
LT. ZOGG	What are you talking about?

LT. ZOGG	What do you mean?
MAJOR KONG	Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
LT. ZOGG	Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
MAJOR KONG	You tell me.
LT. ZOGG	They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
MAJOR KONG	Why should they call us back?
LT. ZOGG	How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.

MAJOR KONG	Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
LT. ZOGG	Look, this is different.
MAJOR KONG	Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
LT. ZOGG	But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
MAJOR KONG	Then that settles it, doesn't it?
LT. ZOGG	Like hell it does.
MAJOR KONG	The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
LT. ZOGG	Right.  So how could we get any messages?
MAJOR KONG	That's the point.
LT. ZOGG	I don't get you, King.
MAJOR KONG	I said that's the point!
LT. ZOGG	Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
MAJOR KONG	Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
LT. ZOGG	Take it easy, Major Kong.
MAJOR KONG	Then get off my back!

MAJOR KONG	There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
LT. ZOGG	But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
MAJOR KONG	Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
LT. ZOGG	Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
MAJOR KONG	Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?

MAJOR KONG	We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
LT. ZOGG	You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
MAJOR KONG	First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
LT. ZOGG	Sorry, King.
MAJOR KONG	Forget it.  Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.

MAJOR KONG	Who's that?
LT. ZOGG	It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
MAJOR KONG	I'm okay.  What's up?
LT. ZOGG	Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
MAJOR KONG	Are you sure?
LT. ZOGG	Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
MAJOR KONG	Maybe the warning system's out.
LT. ZOGG	But I get a red light.
MAJOR KONG	Have you tried the emergency system?
LT. ZOGG	I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.

MAJOR KONG	Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
LT. ZOGG	But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
MAJOR KONG	I asked you a question, Lothar!
LT. ZOGG	But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???

MAJOR KONG	There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
LT. ZOGG	Let me check.
MAJOR KONG	There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.

LT. ZOGG	I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
MAJOR KONG	Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
LT. ZOGG	Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
MAJOR KONG	Roger.

LT. ZOGG	We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
MAJOR KONG	What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?

LT. ZOGG	I thought I'd go along for the ride.
MAJOR KONG	Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
LT. ZOGG	I thought maybe you'd like some company.

LT. ZOGG	King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
MAJOR KONG	I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
LT. ZOGG	Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
MAJOR KONG	Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
LT. ZOGG	Forget it.
MAJOR KONG	I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
LT. ZOGG	Sure, King.
MAJOR KONG	Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.

PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	At the bottom of mines?
VON KLUTZ	Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.

VON KLUTZ	In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
VON KLUTZ	Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.

VON KLUTZ	It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	But who would be chosen?
VON KLUTZ	A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.

VON KLUTZ	When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY	But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
VON KLUTZ	Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those

SNYDER	You the owner here?
BILLIE	That's right.
SNYDER	Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
BILLIE	Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
SNYDER	I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
BILLIE	Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
SNYDER	All right if I look around your lobby?
BILLIE	No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.

SNYDER	Which way are the rooms?
BILLIE	Who told ya this guy was in here?
SNYDER	Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
BILLIE	Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
SNYDER	I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
BILLIE	Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you. 

SNYDER	What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
BILLIE	I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 

SINGLETON	Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
BILLIE	What's the line on Visitation?
SINGLETON	7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
BILLIE	He'll probably fall down.

BILLIE	Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
SINGLETON	Billie.  You ready?

BILLIE	Yeh, go ahead.
SINGLETON	At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.

BLACK MAN	The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
STRANGER	Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?

BLACK MAN	Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
STRANGER	You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
BLACK MAN	No, no cops!

STRANGER	You wanted by the law or somethin'?
BLACK MAN	Naw, it's okay.
STRANGER	You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
BLACK MAN	Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
STRANGER	You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
BLACK MAN	I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
STRANGER	It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
BLACK MAN	I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
STRANGER	I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
BLACK MAN	He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
STRANGER	Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
BLACK MAN	How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
STRANGER	What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.

STRANGER	If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
BLACK MAN	What do we do?
STRANGER	You got a bag or somethin?
BLACK MAN	No.
STRANGER	How 'bout a handkerchief?
BLACK MAN	Here.

BLACK MAN	Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
STRANGER	Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.

BOUDREAU	Twist!  When did you get back in town?
TWIST	Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.

TWIST	Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
BOUDREAU	I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
TWIST	These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
BOUDREAU	Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.

BOUDREAU	Twist, you know this guy?
TWIST	No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.

BOUDREAU	Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
TWIST	Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
BOUDREAU	Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
TWIST	Don't worry about it, pal.

COLEMAN	You're late.  Where you been?
HOOKER	I had some appointments.
COLEMAN	How much did ya lose?
HOOKER	All of it.
COLEMAN	In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
HOOKER	I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
COLEMAN	You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
HOOKER	What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
COLEMAN	No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
HOOKER	You think my play is bad?
COLEMAN	I think it's the best...

COLEMAN	...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
HOOKER	What?
COLEMAN	I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
HOOKER	What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
COLEMAN	It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
HOOKER	Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.
COLEMAN	Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
HOOKER	But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
COLEMAN	And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.

HOOKER	What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
COLEMAN	Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.

COLEMAN	Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
HOOKER	You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
COLEMAN	I'm out, Johnny.
HOOKER	If that's the way you want it.
COLEMAN	That's the way I want it.

LONNEGAN	We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
COMBS	Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
LONNEGAN	Then why ain't he dead?
COMBS	They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
LONNEGAN	Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.

LONNEGAN	And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
COMBS	He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
LONNEGAN	He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.

COMBS	Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
GRANGER	We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
COMBS	You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
GRANGER	Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
COMBS	Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
GRANGER	Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
COMBS	We cleared 22 here.
GRANGER	Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
COMBS	They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.

GRANGER	I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
COMBS	We'll be waitin'.

DUFF	Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
TWIST	You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
DUFF	Wasn't no problem a mine.
TWIST	He was a con man, wasn't he?
DUFF	He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
TWIST	Shove off, Duff.

EIRIE KID	Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
HOOKER	Which way did he do, Eirie?
EIRIE KID	Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
HOOKER	The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.

HOOKER	How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
EIRIE KID	Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
HOOKER	We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
HOOKER	You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
HOOKER	There's always a depression on.
EIRIE KID	If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
HOOKER	I like griftin'.
EIRIE KID	You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
HOOKER	I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
EIRIE KID	Forget it.

EIRIE KID	I thought you blew all your money.
HOOKER	I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.

EIRIE KID	What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.
HOOKER	Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.
EIRIE KID	Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but...

FLOYD	Doyle, can I see you a minute?
LONNEGAN	I'm busy, Floyd.
FLOYD	It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
LONNEGAN	Which one?
FLOYD	Mottola.
LONNEGAN	You sure he didn't just pocket it?

FLOYD	No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
LONNEGAN	They workin' for anybody?
FLOYD	I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
LONNEGAN	All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.

FLOYD	We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
LONNEGAN	What about the other one?
FLOYD	They're still looking for him.
LONNEGAN	Who's got the contract?
FLOYD	Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
LONNEGAN	Hackers.
FLOYD	They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?

LONNEGAN	Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
FLOYD	Yes sir.
LONNEGAN	Good lad.

LONNEGAN	I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
FLOYD	You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
LONNEGAN	I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
FLOYD	What do ya want the others to get?
LONNEGAN	Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.

FLOYD	I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
LONNEGAN	What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?

NILES	Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
GARFIELD	I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
NILES	Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.

GARFIELD	Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
NILES	All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
GARFIELD	All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
NILES	C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
GARFIELD	You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
NILES	Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.

GARFIELD	We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
NILES	Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
GARFIELD	All he's gotta do is read.

GONDORFF	Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.
HOOKER	You sober?
GONDORFF	I can talk, can't I?

GONDORFF	Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
HOOKER	Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.

GONDORFF	I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
HOOKER	He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
GONDORFF	Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
HOOKER	You mean you blew it.
GONDORFF	Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
HOOKER	He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
GONDORFF	No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.

GONDORFF	You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
HOOKER	I picked something up on the way.
GONDORFF	Lonnegan after you, too?
HOOKER	I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
GONDORFF	You never do, kid.

HOOKER	Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
GONDORFF	You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
HOOKER	I wanna play for Lonnegan.
GONDORFF	You know anything about him?
HOOKER	Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know.

HOOKER	Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
GONDORFF	And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
HOOKER	I'll take him anyway.
GONDORFF	Why?
HOOKER	'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.

GONDORFF	You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
HOOKER	We'll get by without 'em.
GONDORFF	This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
HOOKER	I never played for winos.
GONDORFF	You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
HOOKER	You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
GONDORFF	Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
HOOKER	Then you'll do it?
GONDORFF	If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.

HOOKER	He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
GONDORFF	Neither are we.

HOOKER	He's waitin' for you in the card room.
GONDORFF	Let him wait.

GONDORFF	You just worry about your end, kid.
HOOKER	If we ever get to it.

HOOKER	How'd ya do?
GONDORFF	Well we got some workin' money anyway.

GONDORFF	Everything go all right?
HOOKER	Yeh, it was easy.

GONDORFF	No signs of trouble?
HOOKER	What do ya mean?
GONDORFF	You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
HOOKER	No, not a thing.

GONDORFF	How 'bout Lonnegan?
HOOKER	I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
GONDORFF	And?
HOOKER	He threatened to kill me.
GONDORFF	Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.

HOOKER	Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
GONDORFF	Did he hold you up on anything?

HOOKER	You think he'll show?
GONDORFF	Did he say he wouldn't?
HOOKER	No.
GONDORFF	He'll show.

GONDORFF	Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
HOOKER	I thought I'd lost him.

GONDORFF	Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
HOOKER	Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
GONDORFF	Then why'd ya move outa your room?
HOOKER	It was too noisy.
GONDORFF	You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.

GONDORFF	You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
HOOKER	All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
GONDORFF	You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
HOOKER	A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
GONDORFF	Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.

GONDORFF	What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
HOOKER	Just a little nervous, that's all.
GONDORFF	Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.

GONDORFF	Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
HOOKER	How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
GONDORFF	Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business.  'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.  Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.

GONDORFF	I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
HOOKER	Then why you doin' it?
GONDORFF	Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.

HOOKER	Henry.
HOOKER	Yeh.
HOOKER	I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
GONDORFF	Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.

GONDORFF	You beat him, kid.
HOOKER	You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
GONDORFF	You wanta wait for your share?
HOOKER	Naw, I'd just blow it.

NILES	He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
GONDORFF	Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
NILES	The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
GONDORFF	Fancies himself a gambler, huh?

GONDORFF	We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.
NILES	The wire is ten years outa date.
GONDORFF	That's why he won't know it.

NILES	All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
GONDORFF	I also gotta win.

GONDORFF	He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
NILES	Not enough to cover a bet that big.
GONDORFF	Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.

NILES	Looks like he's sulking.
GONDORFF	If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.

GONDORFF	What's the problem?
NILES	He wants to put a half million on Syphon.

SINGLETON	Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
GONDORFF	Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?

SINGLETON	I'm not sure I know it.
GONDORFF	We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?

SINGLETON	You in?
GONDORFF	Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
SINGLETON	He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
GONDORFF	Nice work, J.J.

SINGLETON	Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.
GONDORFF	That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.

GONDORFF	How ya doin'?
SINGLETON	Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.

GONDORFF	Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
LONNEGAN	Lonnegan.

LONNEGAN	Raise 500.
GONDORFF	See ya and raise three.
LONNEGAN	See and raise five.
GONDORFF	Five and call.

GONDORFF	Raise 300.
LONNEGAN	Pass.

GONDORFF	Raise 1,000.
LONNEGAN	Raise 500.

LONNEGAN	See and raise 1,000.
GONDORFF	Raise 5,000.

LONNEGAN	I guess I left it in my room.
GONDORFF	What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.

GONDORFF	Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
LONNEGAN	The name is Lonnegan.
GONDORFF	Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.

GONDORFF	I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.
LONNEGAN	If ya win it could make ya, too.
GONDORFF	What are the odds on Syphon?

GONDORFF	A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.
LONNEGAN	You're more gutless than I thought.

HOOKER	She coulda killed me last night.
GUNMAN	Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
HOOKER	Who are you?
GUNMAN	Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
HOOKER	How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
GUNMAN	Don't have much choice, do ya?

HOOKER	Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
SNYDER	You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
HOOKER	Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.

SNYDER	I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
HOOKER	You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
SNYDER	Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
HOOKER	I'll square it with the fixer.
SNYDER	Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.

HOOKER	My end was only one.
SNYDER	Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.

HOOKER	Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
MAN	What for?  I haven't done anything.
HOOKER	We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
MAN	Yes, a ticket to Chicago.

HOOKER	Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
MAN	But I got a train to make.
HOOKER	It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
MAN	But what about all these other people?
HOOKER	We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.

MAN	I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
HOOKER	All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
MAN	Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
HOOKER	Think nothin' of it.

LORETTA	You done?
HOOKER	Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
LORETTA	It isn't any better.
HOOKER	Where's June today?
LORETTA	She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
HOOKER	Where you goin'?
LORETTA	I don't know.  Depends what train I get on.

HOOKER	Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
LORETTA	Sixty-five.

HOOKER	What time you get off work here?
LORETTA	2:00 A.M.
HOOKER	You doin' anything tonight?
LORETTA	Yeh, sleepin'.

HOOKER	You got a back door to this place?
LORETTA	No.  What's wrong with the front?
HOOKER	Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
LORETTA	No.
HOOKER	All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
LORETTA	What the hell for?
HOOKER	Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.

LORETTA	What does this guy want?
HOOKER	He'd like to kill me.

LORETTA	Looks like he missed ya.
HOOKER	Yeh, this time anyway.

HOOKER	I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
LORETTA	You move right along, don't ya.
HOOKER	I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
LORETTA	And you expect me to come over, just like that.
HOOKER	If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.

LORETTA	I don't even know you.
HOOKER	You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.

HOOKER	You sure it'll be one of these two?
TWIST	No.  They're just the only ones we know of.

HOOKER	Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
TWIST	All right, when?
HOOKER	Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
TWIST	Okay, Tootsie.

HOOKER	Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
TWIST	What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
HOOKER	I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
TWIST	Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.

JIMMY	Hooker!
HOOKER	How ya doin', Jimmy.

JIMMY	Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
HOOKER	Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
JIMMY	You gonna have a go here?  How 'bout a ten spot on the line here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.

JIMMY	You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
HOOKER	I feel lucky tonight.
JIMMY	Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
HOOKER	Three grand on the black, Jimmy.

LONNEGAN	Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
HOOKER	He cheats.

LONNEGAN	He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
HOOKER	Yeh, he knows that.
LONNEGAN	What do you mean?
HOOKER	He hired a dame to take it from ya.

HOOKER	You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
LONNEGAN	I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
HOOKER	So could Shaw.
LONNEGAN	Then why the rat?
HOOKER	Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.

LONNEGAN	What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
HOOKER	Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
LONNEGAN	All right, then.

LONNEGAN	Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
HOOKER	I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
LONNEGAN	I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
HOOKER	All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.

HOOKER	If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
LONNEGAN	That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
HOOKER	Maybe a couple million.

LONNEGAN	You're dreamin', kid.
HOOKER	660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
LONNEGAN	If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.

LONNEGAN	You should always look to the back too, kid.
HOOKER	I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
LONNEGAN	Get on with it then.
HOOKER	Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
LONNEGAN	You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
HOOKER	This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
LONNEGAN	And you were gonna pay me back?
HOOKER	I am after this race.

LONNEGAN	You really picked a winner, kid.
HOOKER	Give 'em a little time.

HOOKER	Well, what did I tell ya?
LONNEGAN	You're a lucky man, all right.
HOOKER	Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
LONNEGAN	Why don't ya then.
HOOKER	'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
LONNEGAN	You got a system, Carver?

HOOKER	You stayin' in or not?
LONNEGAN	I'm in.
HOOKER	It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.

LONNEGAN	You got the 400 grand yet?
HOOKER	Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
LONNEGAN	I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
HOOKER	What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
LONNEGAN	If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.

HOOKER	I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.
LONNEGAN	Let me talk to him.
HOOKER	No.
LONNEGAN	You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.

LONNEGAN	What happened to your face?
HOOKER	Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.

LONNEGAN	A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
HOOKER	He's right, Les.

HOOKER	What happened?
LONNEGAN	I didn't get the bet down in time.
HOOKER	Oh, Jesus.

LONNEGAN	Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
HOOKER	How am I gonna do that?
LONNEGAN	I don't know, figure something out.

POLK	You want a drink or something?
HOOKER	No.
POLK	We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
HOOKER	Don't think I know him.
POLK	Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
HOOKER	Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.

HOOKER	You got nothin' on me.
POLK	We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.

POLK	Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
HOOKER	No.

POLK	You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
HOOKER	I'll make parole.
POLK	Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.

HOOKER	Will you wait until the chump is played?
POLK	Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
HOOKER	I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
POLK	All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
HOOKER	Just as long as I get to finish the play.

TWIST	Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
LONNEGAN	I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
TWIST	But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
LONNEGAN	I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
TWIST	On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
LONNEGAN	If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
TWIST	We were getting 50 from our guy.
LONNEGAN	With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.

TWIST	Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.
LONNEGAN	Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.

LONNEGAN	Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
TWIST	On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.

LONNEGAN	All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
RILEY	We missed him.
LONNEGAN	You weren't hired to miss him.
RILEY	There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
LONNEGAN	Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
RILEY	I don't know.  He took it hard.
LONNEGAN	All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.

TWIST	We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
OLD MAN	For fifteen years.
TWIST	I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
OLD MAN	Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
TWIST	This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
OLD MAN	Never heard of the place.

SNYDER	What is this?  I got work to do.
POLK	Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.

POLK	Do ya know him or don't ya?
SNYDER	Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
POLK	Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
SNYDER	Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.
POLK	There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
SNYDER	Why don't you pick him up yourself?
POLK	Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
SNYDER	Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
POLK	Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
SNYDER	What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
POLK	He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
SNYDER	He'll never do it.
POLK	I think he will.

NICK	Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
1ST REPORTER	Come on, gimme a break.
NICK	I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.

1ST REPORTER	Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
NICK	No.

1ST REPORTER	What about this Rosebreen?
NICK	Sorry.  Don't know a thing.

1ST REPORTER	What's your next step, Nick?
NICK	Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
1ST REPORTER	We'll see you before you go.

GILBERT	There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
1ST REPORTER	He was?
GILBERT	Yes.  He admitted it.
1ST REPORTER	Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
GILBERT	Why not?
1ST REPORTER	You know how they are... sex...
GILBERT	Then just say he was sixty years old.
1ST REPORTER	Is that what it means?
GILBERT	Of course.

ANDREW	I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
DOROTHY	Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 

ANDREW	All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
DOROTHY	Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
ANDREW	Oh.  I'll do my own typing!

ANDREW	Cheer up, darling.
DOROTHY	I'm sorry.

ANDREW	What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
DOROTHY	It's all right.

ANDREW	Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
DOROTHY	But tonight is Christmas Eve!
ANDREW	He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
DOROTHY	He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.

ANDREW	What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
DOROTHY	Just a minute...

ANDREW	Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
DOROTHY	I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.

ANDREW	Any luck?
DOROTHY	He's just around the corner.

ANDREW	She's got me worrying, too.
NICK	Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
ANDREW	Why did that man want to kill him?
NICK	Said he stole his invention.
ANDREW	Do you suppose.....  ?

NICK	What?
ANDREW	Nothing.
NICK	You better take a drink.

ANDREW	How are you?
WYNANT	Another young man.
ANDREW	It's the same one.

WYNANT	Well!
ANDREW	That is, if it's all right with you.
WYNANT	And if it isn't?

ANDREW	Mind if I look around?
WYNANT	Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 

DOROTHY	Oh, Andy.
ANDY	Don't cry.
DOROTHY	I can't help it.  You don't know.....
ANDY	Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
DOROTHY	I can't.
ANDY	You've got to get your mind off this.
DOROTHY	You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
ANDY	Go!
DOROTHY	And don't ever try to see me again.
ANDY	What are you talking about?
DOROTHY	Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
ANDY	Do you think I care
DOROTHY	You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
ANDY	I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
DOROTHY	I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
ANDY	Dorothy!
DOROTHY	How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
ANDY	You're talking like a crazy person,
DOROTHY	Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
ANDY	Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
DOROTHY	Go away!

DOROTHY	This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
ANDY	You're high enough.
DOROTHY	Why not?

ANDY	Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
DOROTHY	Oh, Andy, Andy!

MIMI	How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
DOROTHY	Give it to me.
MIMI	Oh, here she is.

MIMI	What is it? Has he found him?
DOROTHY	Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.

MIMI	What is it?
DOROTHY	Nothing.

MIMI	That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
DOROTHY	He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
MIMI	No.
DOROTHY	You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
MIMI	That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
DOROTHY	I won't have you hounding him any more for money.

DOROTHY	Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
MIMI	I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
DOROTHY	Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
MIMI	Shush!

DOROTHY	Don't.  It's horrible.
MIMI	Nonsense! She got at she deserved.

DOROTHY	You took that money from Julia's hand.
MIMI	I didn't.
DOROTHY	Then what are you hiding?
MIMI	It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
DOROTHY	You hand that over to the police.
MIMI	I'll do nothing of the sort.
DOROTHY	All right, then.  I'll tell them.
MIMI	I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
DOROTHY	I don't believe it! You're lying!
MIMI	There!

DOROTHY	Oh!
MIMI	Now do you believe me!

DOROTHY	Mother!
MIMI	And I'll give then proof!

MACAULAY	How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
DOROTHY	Thanks...  we're taking your cab.

MACAULAY	Is your father still in there?
DOROTHY	He's waiting for you.
MACAULAY	Did he tell you where he was going?
DOROTHY	He wouldn't say.
MACAULAY	Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.

DOROTHY	He didn't do it -- Nick!
MACAULAY	What do you mean?

NICK	Another Martini --
DOROTHY	Hello, there!

DOROTHY	You know, we know each other.
NICK	Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
DOROTHY	Aren't you Nick Charles?
NICK	Yes.
DOROTHY	You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.

NICK	Not that scrawny little....? 
DOROTHY	Yes.
NICK	How did you ever remember me?
DOROTHY	was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
NICK	Probably not.

DOROTHY	Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
NICK	Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
DOROTHY	That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
NICK	Disappeared!

NICK	I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
DOROTHY	Macaulay.
NICK	That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
DOROTHY	tried him once -
NICK	Why don't you try him again?

NICK	Your father?
DOROTHY	No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.

DOROTHY	How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
NICK	We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
DOROTHY	Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.

NICK	I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
DOROTHY	Oh, thank heaven.

NICK	Come on in.
DOROTHY	I've got to see you alone!

DOROTHY	You heard about Julia Wolf?
NICK	Yes.
DOROTHY	There. 
NICK	What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
DOROTHY	Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
NICK	Where did you hit her?
DOROTHY	Why... in the heart.
NICK	Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
DOROTHY	She fell down.
NICK	Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
DOROTHY	I don't know.
NICK	Which way did she fall?
DOROTHY	She... she fell over backwards.
NICK	Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.

NICK	Where did you get this gun?
DOROTHY	I bought it in a pawn shop.
NICK	Don't lie to me.
DOROTHY	That's the truth.

NICK	Hello, Dorothy. 
DOROTHY	Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 

DOROTHY	Dead?
NICK	He's been dead for three months.

DOROTHY	It's been the same one for three months.
WYNANT	Forgive me.  How are you?
DOROTHY	Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.

DOROTHY	He'll still be your son-in-law!
WYNANT	You see how much we have to say.
DOROTHY	Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....

DOROTHY	Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
WYNANT	Yes, she would.
DOROTHY	I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
WYNANT	What would your mother say to that?
DOROTHY	This is my wedding.
WYNANT	Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
DOROTHY	He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
WYNANT	If you think it'll be all right.

WYNANT	Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
DOROTHY	Where are you going?
WYNANT	It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
DOROTHY	A new invention?
WYNANT	Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
DOROTHY	We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
WYNANT	Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
DOROTHY	It's a promise?
WYNANT	That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.

WYNANT	How's your brother?
DOROTHY	He's all right.

WYNANT	I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
DOROTHY	You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
WYNANT	I know -- I know --
DOROTHY	You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.

WYNANT	Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
DOROTHY	And he still wants to marry me!
WYNANT	He's a brave man.

DOROTHY	Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
WYNANT	Only in bad weather.
DOROTHY	But it isn't bad weather now.
WYNANT	Better get home before it is.
DOROTHY	Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
WYNANT	Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.

DR. WALTON	You can take that out to the car.
NICK	Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
DR. WALTON	Yes.
NICK	Do you mind if I come down and see it?
DR. WALTON	Not at all.
NICK	I'm very interested in that body.

NICK	Shrapnel!
DR. WALTON	Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
NICK	Yes... yes.

MIMI	What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
GILBERT	He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
MIMI	That woman!
GILBERT	She could tell you where father is.

GILBERT	Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
MIMI	Not a thing.
GILBERT	Was there much blood?

GILBERT	Did you kill her?
MIMI	Gilbert!
GILBERT	Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
MIMI	I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.

GILBERT	Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
MIMI	Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.

GILBERT	I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
MIMI	What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
GILBERT	know.  But I saw him -

NICK	How'd you people happen to pop in?
GUILD	We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
NICK	Yes.  I might not have been shot.
GUILD	We were looking for this bird.

NICK	I never saw him before.
GUILD	What's he want of you?
NICK	Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
GUILD	What's that to you?
NICK	Nothing.
GUILD	What'd he think it was to you?
NICK	Ask him.  I don't know.
GUILD	I'm asking you.
NICK	Keep on asking.

NICK	Not without a warrant.
GUILD	So you say -  Go on, Bob.

GUILD	Have you got a pistol permit?
NICK	No.
GUILD	Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?

GUILD	This gun yours?
NICK	No.
GUILD	Who's is it?
NICK	I'll have to try to remember.
GUILD	Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.

GUILD	You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
NICK	You mean about that gun?
GUILD	That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.

GUILD	Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
NICK	Man to man, I'm not.

NICK	So would I.
GUILD	It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?

NICK	What about the suicide?
GUILD	Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
NICK	I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.

NICK	You've been there?
GUILD	Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.

NICK	No proof?
GUILD	Nothing yet to cinch it.
NICK	Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
GUILD	What do you mean?
NICK	For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
GUILD	Who's your candidate?
NICK	I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
GUILD	They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
NICK	What about Jorgensen?
GUILD	I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.

NICK	What about this Nunheim?
GUILD	Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
NICK	Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
GUILD	No.
NICK	He's holding out on you.
GUILD	Let's go and see.  Taxi!

GUILD	Well, what'd you think?
NICK	I think we're on the right track.
GUILD	Who're you calling?
NICK	I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
GUILD	Trail him!  Trail who?
NICK	Nunheim!

GUILD	Get anything?
NICK	She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.

GUILD	I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
NICK	Fifty will still get you a hundred.
GUILD	This is enough for me.

NICK	Just rolled them up and threw them in.
GUILD	Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
NICK	Extraordinarily lucky.

GUILD	D.W.R.  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
NICK	Rosebreen.
GUILD	Could this be him?
NICK	I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
GUILD	He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
NICK	Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
GUILD	Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?

GUILD	What're you doing here?
NICK	I'll take care of him.

GUILD	Are you kidding?
NICK	No.
GUILD	Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
NICK	Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.

GUILD	You mean that body-----?
NICK	--was Wynant's.

GUILD	Shut up.
NICK	You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?

GUILD	When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
MACAULAY	Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
GUILD	Seen any signs of it, Bill?

MACAULAY	I said he hadn't written me.
GUILD	Oh, then you did hear from him?
MACAULAY	Well....
GUILD	Well, what?
MACAULAY	He telephoned me today.
GUILD	He did!
MACAULAY	I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
GUILD	When was that?
MACAULAY	About three.
GUILD	Did you go?
MACAULAY	Yes.  But he didn't show up.

MACAULAY	I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
GUILD	Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
MACAULAY	I didn't know they had a fight.
GUILD	Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.

GUILD	There are a few things we want to check up on.
MIMI	I see.
GUILD	You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
MIMI	Why yes.
GUILD	Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
MIMI	No.
GUILD	Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
MIMI	I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
GUILD	The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....

GUILD	That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
MIMI	Goodbye.
GUILD	Goodbye.

GUILD	You did!
MIMI	That's nothing.  I saw him myself.

GUILD	What kind of clothes was he wearing?
MIMI	A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
GUILD	Tell 'em.

MIMI	That's ridiculous.
GUILD	Let him have his say out.

GUILD	Good morning --
NORA	Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.

NORA	But he's interested!
GUILD	I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.

NORA	Do you think that Wynant did it?
GUILD	Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.

NORA	I think we may as well sit down.
GUILD	I guess all the suspects are here.

NORA	Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
GUILD	They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
NORA	You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.

NUNHEIM	Have a shot?
GUILD	What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
NUNHEIM	That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.

NUNHEIM	She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
GUILD	Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
NUNHEIM	That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
GUILD	Want to take a poke at him?
NUNHEIM	I didn't mean you, Mister.

GUILD	You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
NUNHEIM	You don't think I had anything to do with it?
GUILD	Where were you?

GUILD	Where were you?
NUNHEIM	Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!

NUNHEIM	Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
GUILD	Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?

NUNHEIM	I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
GUILD	How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
NUNHEIM	Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!

MIMI	Don't mind what she says, Chris.
JORGENSEN	How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
MIMI	I'll get some.
JORGENSEN	You've said that for weeks.
MIMI	I know.
JORGENSEN	Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
MIMI	Chris!
JORGENSEN	All right.  All right.
MIMI	I couldn't go near that woman.
JORGENSEN	I said all right!

MIMI	What are you going to do?
JORGENSEN	Just what I said I'd do.
MIMI	You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
JORGENSEN	Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
MIMI	Chris -- Chris -- !

MIMI	and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
JORGENSEN	I thought you said you weren't going there.
MIMI	Why, you said...
JORGENSEN	Never mind.

JULIA	We're just having a little drink.
WYNANT	So I see.

WYNANT	Who's that man?
JULIA	He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
WYNANT	I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
JULIA	This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
WYNANT	I don't like him.
JULIA	Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
WYNANT	No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
JULIA	What bonds?
WYNANT	The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
JULIA	Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
WYNANT	I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
JULIA	Don't you remember....
WYNANT	Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
JULIA	Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
WYNANT	No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
JULIA	What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
WYNANT	That's my business.
JULIA	supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?

WYNANT	I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
JULIA	Go ahead!
WYNANT	They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.

JULIA	That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
WYNANT	Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
JULIA	I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
WYNANT	You're going to return every cent of it!
JULIA	I can't! I haven't got it!
WYNANT	What did you do with the rest?
JULIA	I never had it.
WYNANT	Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...

NORA	Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
MACAULAY	Yes?

NORA	Oh, hello.  Come on in.
MACAULAY	Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
NORA	Oh, he's sitting up.
MACAULAY	Good.

NORA	Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
MACAULAY	That's all right.

MACAULAY	I got word from Wynant this morning...
NORA	So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.

NORA	Oh, please, Nick.
MACAULAY	Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?

WYNANT	Did you get my money?
MACAULAY	I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
WYNANT	I'm not telling anyone.
MACAULAY	But suppose some business comes up...
WYNANT	That's just why I'm going.

MACAULAY	One hundred...  two hundred... three...
WYNANT	Never mind.
MACAULAY	I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
WYNANT	I trust you.
MACAULAY	Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
WYNANT	No.
MACAULAY	Well, let me do that for you.
WYNANT	You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!

WYNANT	Thanks, and goodbye.
MACAULAY	What'll I do if something comes up?
WYNANT	Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
MACAULAY	Is Julia going with you?
WYNANT	No.

MACAULAY	But what if you need more money?
WYNANT	I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.

MACAULAY	How are you?
NICK	Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
MACAULAY	Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
NICK	That's all right.  What are you drinking?

MACAULAY	Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
NICK	Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
MACAULAY	She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
NICK	I haven't been a detective for four years.
MACAULAY	You don't say --
NICK	My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
MACAULAY	I see.  I see.
NICK	What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
MACAULAY	You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
NICK	No word at all?
MACAULAY	He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.

NICK	My wife.
MACAULAY	How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
NICK	S'long.

NICK	How are you?
MACAULAY	I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
NICK	That's all right.

MACAULAY	What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
NICK	Slim.

NICK	It might.
MACAULAY	He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
NICK	It wouldn't hurt to put it in.

MACAULAY	I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
NICK	Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
MACAULAY	Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.

MACAULAY	But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
NICK	Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.

MACAULAY	I have no right to answer that.
NICK	What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?

MIMI	Oh, Nick... Nick!
NICK	Hello, Mimi.
MIMI	want to talk to you about something very important.

MIMI	Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
NICK	What do you think?
MIMI	Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
NICK	Well, don't you?
MIMI	You're always teasing.

MIMI	Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
NICK	Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
MIMI	But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
NICK	I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
MIMI	Dorothy!  Is she here?
NICK	Yes...

MIMI	Where's Gilbert?
NICK	Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.

MIMI	Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
NICK	You should have told them he'd disappeared.

MIMI	But he has nothing to do with it!
NICK	That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?

MIMI	I tell you -- he didn't do it.
NICK	They'll want more than your word for that.
MIMI	All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!

MIMI	This is all very pleasant but why are here?
NICK	I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.

NICK	You did... where?
MIMI	Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
NICK	Oh, did he?  What did he say?
MIMI	He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.

MIMI	Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
NICK	So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.

MIMI	Perfectly absurd.
NICK	And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.

MIMI	Nobody told me.  I did see him!
NICK	What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
MIMI	It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
NICK	You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
MIMI	I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
NICK	Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?

MORELLI	I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
NICK	Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.

NICK	I've never heard about you.
MORELLI	I didn't knock Julia off.
NICK	All right - you didn't.
MORELLI	I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
NICK	Why tell me?
MORELLI	I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
NICK	That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
MORELLI	Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
NICK	How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
MORELLI	He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
NICK	I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
MORELLI	That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
NICK	I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....

MORELLI	What's that?
NICK	This is your party.

NICK	Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
MORELLI	She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
NICK	Why do you say that?
MORELLI	Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
NICK	Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?

MORELLI	What am I?  The fall guy?
NICK	I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?

NORA	So it's you he was after!
NICK	Hello, baby.
NORA	He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
NICK	I had him out this morning.
NORA	I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
NICK	Oh, this is Andy --

NORA	You might have mentioned me first.
NICK	He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
NORA	As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --

NORA	Pretty girl.
NICK	If you like 'em like that.
NORA	You got types?
NICK	Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
NORA	Who is she?
NICK	I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
NORA	By the way, how is your father's side?
NICK	Much better, thanks.
NORA	How many drinks have you had?
NICK	Six Martinis.
NORA	Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.

NORA	What hit me?
NICK	That last Martini.

NORA	I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
NICK	Take it easy.

NORA	Who's that?
NICK	Santa Claus.

NICK	Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
NORA	We need ice.

NORA	I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
NICK	I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
NORA	Room service, please -

NORA	Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
NICK	I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.

NORA	Isn't that my drink?
NICK	What are you drinking?
NORA	Rye.

NORA	Where did you get that?
NICK	She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
NORA	What are you going to do with it?
NICK	Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.

NICK	She didn't tell me a thing.
NORA	Too bad you didn't bring your whip.

NORA	Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
NICK	Yes.
NORA	Good. I want to talk to you.
NICK	That's jolly.
NORA	Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
NICK	Can't you get to sleep?
NORA	No.
NICK	Maybe a drink would help you.
NORA	No thanks.
NICK	Maybe it would if I took it.

NORA	Everybody says you were a grand detective.
NICK	They were kidding you.
NORA	I'd like to see you work.
NICK	Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.

NORA	That poor girl is in a tough spot.
NICK	There's nothing I can do to help her.

NORA	She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
NICK	Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
NORA	I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
NICK	At breakfast.

NORA	But it's Christmas now.
NICK	Breakfast.
NORA	What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
NICK	You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.

NORA	Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
NICK	That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.

NORA	You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
NICK	All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?

NICK	It's all right.  It just grazed me.
NORA	Someone get a doctor.
NICK	There's one coming.
NORA	Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
NICK	Sure -- I don't even feel it.
NORA	I'll get some towels. 

NICK	I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
NORA	Want a drink?
NICK	Yeah.

NORA	I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
NICK	He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!

NICK	You're a fine watch dog.
NORA	He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
NICK	On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
NORA	Well, didn't you?

NICK	I never saw that before.
NORA	No.  It's a Christmas present.
NICK	Who gave it to you?
NORA	You did.
NICK	You must admit I have good taste.

NORA	Finished with these?
NICK	Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.

NORA	I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
NICK	That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.

NICK	Hello... send him up.
NORA	Who's that?
NICK	Macaulay.

NICK	Aren't you hot in that?
NORA	I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
NICK	Is that another Christmas present?
NORA	Yes.
NICK	Did I give it to you?
NORA	Yes.

NORA	Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
NICK	Let's see.  Where's it from?
NORA	Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
NICK	I don't know.
NORA	He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
NICK	Your guess is as good as mine.
NORA	Oh take it!  Please take it!

NICK	Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
NORA	Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.

NORA	Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
NICK	It's not going to hurt me to get up.
NORA	Sit down!
NICK	You talk as if I were Asta.
NORA	All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.

NORA	What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
NICK	What's the matter with you?
NORA	The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
NICK	Maybe I will.
NORA	But Wynant --- ?
NICK	I don't believe he did it.
NORA	Why don't you?
NICK	No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
NORA	So am I.
NICK	Come on, Watson, we're going places.

NICK	This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
NORA	Catch me letting you go alone!

NORA	I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
NICK	I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
NORA	He's just been for a walk.
NICK	We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?

NORA	What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
NICK	Looks like a hold-up!
NORA	What are you going to do?
NICK	I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
NORA	Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
NICK	He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
NORA	You mean, he might be hiding there?
NICK	I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
NORA	Nick - I won't have you going down there.
NICK	Say you're the one who got me in this!
NORA	I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
NICK	I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
NORA	Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
NICK	You wouldn't be a widow long.
NORA	You bet I wouldn't.
NICK	Not with all your money!
NORA	You dog!
NICK	Goodbye, darling.
NORA	Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
NICK	Sure I will.
NORA	Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
NICK	Why, I believe the little woman cares.
NORA	I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!

NORA	Back to California
NICK	My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
NORA	I want you to stay and find Wynant.
NICK	I did find him!
NORA	What do you mean?
NICK	He was down in the shop.
NORA	Nick!
NICK	It was his body that was buried there.
NORA	Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
NICK	That's a fact.
NORA	Wynant's body?
NICK	Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
NORA	But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
NICK	That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
NORA	What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
NICK	Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
NORA	Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
NICK	Huh?
NORA	What things made you so sure?
NICK	Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
NORA	Well, don't they?
NICK	Sure.

NORA	You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
NICK	I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.

NORA	How long has he been dead?
NICK	Couple of months anyway.
NORA	Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
NICK	Smart gal.
NORA	Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
NICK	No.  Nobody but you.

NORA	I'm going to tell her.
NICK	Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
NORA	But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
NICK	I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
NORA	Why not?
NICK	I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
NORA	What are you going to do?
NICK	I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
NORA	Yes!
NICK	Got a nice evening dress?
NORA	Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
NICK	Got a nice evening dress?
NORA	I've got a lulu -- why?
NICK	I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
NORA	The suspects!  They won't come.
NICK	Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
NORA	Who do you think did it?
NICK	Mimi...
NORA	Mimi!
NICK	Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 

NORA	You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
NICK	Thank you, Mrs. Charles.

NORA	I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
NICK	Yes.
NORA	I wish you'd tell me who.
NICK	I wish you'd tell me.

NORA	Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
NICK	I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.

NORA	You're going to drive me crazy!
NICK	Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.

NORA	If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
NICK	After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?

NORA	Is that true?
NICK	I don't know.
NORA	Why are you saying it?
NICK	It's the only way it makes sense.
NORA	I hope you're well.
NICK	His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.

NICK	Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
TANNER	No, Mr. Charles.
NICK	How did you get in here?
TANNER	I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
NICK	You worked here?
TANNER	Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
NICK	Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
TANNER	That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
NICK	Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
TANNER	Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
NICK	Trying to put it off on her?
TANNER	Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
NICK	You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
TANNER	Police!

NICK	I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
TANNER	No... no.

TANNER	That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
NICK	You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?

PEPPLER	Nick Charles here?
NORA	Yes.  Nick!
PEPPLER	You his wife?
NORA	Yes.
PEPPLER	He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!

NORA	Was he a good detective?
PEPPLER	I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.

TANNER	Well, congratulations.
WYNANT	I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
TANNER	Bonds, sir?
WYNANT	I know I left them there.
TANNER	Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
WYNANT	Maybe she has.
TANNER	You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
WYNANT	Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 

TOM	I'm sorry...  but...
WYNANT	Two weeks work gone for nothing.
TOM	I just wanted to tell you...
WYNANT	I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!

WYNANT	Where are you going?
TOM	Home!
WYNANT	Home?
TOM	I'm fired.
WYNANT	Who fired you?
TOM	You did.

MARIETTE	What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
BOLSHEVIK	So you lost a handbag, madame?
MARIETTE	Yes.
BOLSHEVIK	And it had diamonds in the back.
MARIETTE	Yes.
BOLSHEVIK	And diamonds in the front.
MARIETTE	Yes.
BOLSHEVIK	Diamonds all over.
MARIETTE	Well, have you found it?
BOLSHEVIK	No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!

BUTLER	M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
GASTON	Very well, Jacques.

BUTLER	Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
GASTON	At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.

BUTLER	M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
GASTON	In a moment.

BUTLER	on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
BUTLER	Yes, M'sieu Laval?
GASTON	Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.

BUTLER	M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
GASTON	Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
BUTLER	Yes, M'sieu Laval!

CLOSE SHOT  GASTON	still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
MARIETTE	Where did you find it?

MARIETTE	Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON	erect in sweater, arms folded.

MARIETTE	No!
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON	in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.

MARIETTE	Eleven o'clock! 
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON	A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.

MARIETTE	With the compliments of Colet and Company!
CLOSE SHOT  GASTON	He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.

MANAGER	The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
FRANÃOIS	I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.

MANAGER	Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
FRANÃOIS	Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.

MANAGER	And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
FRANÃOIS	I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."

MANAGER	The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
FRANÃOIS	No!
MANAGER	<u>Niente!</u>
FRANÃOIS	That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.

MANAGER	What did you talk about?
FRANÃOIS	About tonsils.
MANAGER	<u>Tonsili!</u>
FRANÃOIS	So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.

GASTON	Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
FRANÃOIS	I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
GASTON	Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.

GASTON	Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
FRANÃOIS	You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--

FRANÃOIS	I wanted to say goodbye to you.
GASTON	Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
FRANÃOIS	But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
GASTON	No.
FRANÃOIS	You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
GASTON	No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
FRANÃOIS	No.
GASTON	Amsterdam?
FRANÃOIS	No.
GASTON	Constantinople?
FRANÃOIS	No.
GASTON	You've never been in Constantinople?
FRANÃOIS	No!
GASTON	But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
FRANÃOIS	Yes!
GASTON	Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
FRANÃOIS	But--
GASTON	I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
FRANÃOIS	And harems ... ?
GASTON	<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.

FRANÃOIS	Good morning, Major.
MAJOR	Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.

FRANÃOIS	Nice day, Major.
MAJOR	Umm.
FRANÃOIS	You're looking fine, Major.
MAJOR	Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!

MAJOR	No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
FRANÃOIS	Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
MAJOR	No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
FRANÃOIS	The type they marry.
MAJOR	You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
FRANÃOIS	Nice suit.
MAJOR	Like it?
FRANÃOIS	Smart. London, eh?
MAJOR	Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
FRANÃOIS	I thought so.

FRANÃOIS	He's really not a bad fellow.
MAJOR	Just dull.
FRANÃOIS	Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
MAJOR	Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
FRANÃOIS	Doc--!

WAITER	Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
GASTON	Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
WAITER	Yes, Baron.
GASTON	If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
WAITER	I would start with cocktails.
GASTON	Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!

GASTON	It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
WAITER	Yes, Baron.
GASTON	And, waiter--you see that moon?
WAITER	Yes, Baron.
GASTON	I want to see that moon in the champagne.
WAITER	Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
GASTON	I want to see-- 
WAITER	Yes, Baron.
GASTON	And as for you, waiter--
WAITER	Yes, Baron?
GASTON	I don't want to see you at all!
WAITER	No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
GASTON	Thank you.

GASTON	You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
WAITER	But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
GASTON	You can trust me.
WAITER	Yes, Baron. Thank you. 

GIRON	M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
GASTON	Um-hum ...
GIRON	You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
GASTON	Just a second.

GIRON	I hope you find the figures correct.
GASTON	I hope so, too.
GIRON	M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
GASTON	For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
GIRON	And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.

GASTON	And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
GIRON	Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
GASTON	Two weeks and three days.
GIRON	Um-hum!
GASTON	Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
GIRON	No, not at all!
GASTON	Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
GIRON	I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
GASTON	And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
GIRON	I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
GASTON	And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
GIRON	Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
GASTON	I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
GIRON	Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
GASTON	I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!

GASTON	I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
GIRON	I've got to see you.
GASTON	But not now.
GIRON	Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
GASTON	It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
GIRON	No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.

GASTON	Yes, m'sieu.
GIRON	And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
GASTON	Very well, m'sieu.
GIRON	Otherwise I'll call the police
GASTON	Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
GIRON	What is it?
GASTON	You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
GIRON	What do you mean?
GASTON	You say I am a crook.
GIRON	I know it!
GASTON	Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
GIRON	M'sieu ...
GASTON	Monescu.
GIRON	M'sieu Monescu!
GASTON	Just call me Gaston.

GASTON	You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
MAJOR	Just as you say, Doctor.
GASTON	Thank you, Major. 
MAJOR	Good day, Doctor.
GASTON	Good day, Major.

MAJOR	No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
GASTON	Now just a minute, Major--
MAJOR	No, Captain, I tell you--

GASTON	Who?
LILY	The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
GASTON	The tennis player?
LILY	The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
GASTON	But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.

LILY	Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
GASTON	No--no.
LILY	Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
GASTON	I would like to.
LILY	You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
GASTON	Why should you?
LILY	But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!

GASTON	Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
LILY	You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
GASTON	Thank you!
LILY	Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
GASTON	Disappointed?
LILY	No--proud. Very proud!

GASTON	That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
LILY	Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
GASTON	Please.
LILY	Thank you.
GASTON	The pepper, too?
LILY	No, thank you.
GASTON	You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 

LILY	I like you, Baron.
GASTON	I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.

LILY	Thank you, Baron.
GASTON	Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
LILY	What time is it?

LILY	Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
GASTON	You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
LILY	Monescu!
GASTON	Gaston Monescu.
LILY	Gaston!

LILY	I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
GASTON	Last year? It can't be that long.
LILY	Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?

LILY	Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
GASTON	And take the twenty thousand francs ...
LILY	Right.
GASTON	Sweetheart, what day is today?
LILY	The fourteenth of May.
GASTON	And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
LILY	The six--

GASTON	We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
LILY	We'll take the Royal Suite!
GASTON	Two fifty-three, five--
LILY	Seven and nine!
GASTON	And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
LILY	Darling!

GASTON	--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
LILY	And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
GASTON	No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke--all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>--why take a chance on jewelry?

LILY	You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
GASTON	What?
LILY	But it's not enough!

LILY	<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
GASTON	Ah!
LILY	Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
GASTON	Certainly!
LILY	They're all right, aren't they?
GASTON	Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
LILY	Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
GASTON	Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
LILY	Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!

LILY	Filiba ...
GASTON	Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
LILY	Five, seven, and nine--
GASTON	Yes!  Now don't worry!

GASTON	ÃysÃ©e seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
LILY	He recognized you!
GASTON	No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
LILY	Spanish passports?
GASTON	Correct. Now the train leaves--
LILY	At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
GASTON	Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
LILY	Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is DoÃ±a Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
GASTON	I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
LILY	Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
GASTON	By the way, how is your German?
LILY	<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
GASTON	<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
LILY	<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
GASTON	<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
LILY	<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.

GASTON	Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
LILY	What time is your rendezvous?
GASTON	Now, Lily--
LILY	Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
GASTON	You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
LILY	That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
GASTON	Don't you <u>realize</u>--
LILY	Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
GASTON	Lily, you must listen to me.
LILY	Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
GASTON	But, Lily--
LILY	Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!

LILY	And you--
GASTON	Lily-- 
LILY	Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  Well--  she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a <u>handbag</u>. You can pay a <u>hundred</u> thousand for him!]

LILY	Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
GASTON	Lily!

MARIETTE	Yes...?
GASTON	Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
MARIETTE	That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!

GASTON	You know the main staircase in the opera?
MARIETTE	Yes.
GASTON	Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
MARIETTE	Yes.
GASTON	Then you go into the foyer.
MARIETTE	Yes.
GASTON	And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
MARIETTE	I know that niche.
GASTON	And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
MARIETTE	I remember.
GASTON	You like that statue?
MARIETTE	Not particularly.
GASTON	Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
MARIETTE	I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
GASTON	Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
MARIETTE	Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
GASTON	Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
MARIETTE	Well--I am Madame Colet.
GASTON	And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.

MARIETTE	Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
GASTON	The pleasure is mine, madame.

GASTON	One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
MARIETTE	But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
GASTON	Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
MARIETTE	Oh! You didn't read it!
GASTON	Naturally I did.
MARIETTE	Oh!
GASTON	You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
MARIETTE	M'sieu Laval!
GASTON	But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
MARIETTE	What's wrong now?
GASTON	With your skin, I prefer crimson.
MARIETTE	Too much blue in crimson.
GASTON	That's what you need!
MARIETTE	No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
GASTON	What shade of powder do you use?
MARIETTE	Peaches and cream.
GASTON	That's too dark.
MARIETTE	Do you realize I have light eyes?
GASTON	But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.

MARIETTE	Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
GASTON	In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
MARIETTE	Yes.
GASTON	Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
MARIETTE	Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 

GASTON	Do you know my first name?
MARIETTE	No. What is it? Tell me.

GASTON	And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
MARIETTE	What?
GASTON	Make it out to cash!
MARIETTE	As you like. 

GASTON	Eighteenth century.
MARIETTE	Yes!
GASTON	Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
MARIETTE	Right!
GASTON	Beautiful specimen.
MARIETTE	It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
GASTON	Oh? 
MARIETTE	This used to be my secretary's room.
GASTON	I see.  She must have been very happy here.
MARIETTE	Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
GASTON	Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 

GASTON	But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
MARIETTE	You think that's too much?
GASTON	No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
MARIETTE	That sounds sensible. 

GASTON	Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
MARIETTE	Then I mislay my checkbook--
GASTON	Then you use the wrong lipstick--
MARIETTE	And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
GASTON	It's disgraceful!
MARIETTE	Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
GASTON	Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
MARIETTE	Ye-es?
GASTON	And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
MARIETTE	What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
GASTON	The same thing.
MARIETTE	You're hired!

GASTON	Madame.
MARIETTE	Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
GASTON	I'll be delighted.
MARIETTE	And so will M'sieu Giron.

GASTON	Yes, madame?
MARIETTE	What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
GASTON	Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
MARIETTE	Um-hum ...
GASTON	Then riding together.
MARIETTE	Um-hum ...
GASTON	Then lunch in the Bois--
MARIETTE	Together.
GASTON	Then a little nap--
MARIETTE	How do you like my dress?
GASTON	Beautiful.
MARIETTE	Hair?
GASTON	Marvelous.
MARIETTE	Lipstick?

GASTON	Crimson!
MARIETTE	Correct!  Good night.
GASTON	Good night. 
MARIETTE	Good night.
GASTON	Goodbye.

GASTON	But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
MARIETTE	Talk? About me--about us?
GASTON	Precisely.
MARIETTE	Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
GASTON	No--yours, madame.
MARIETTE	M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...

MARIETTE	But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
GASTON	You would?
MARIETTE	Yes, I would!
GASTON	Like that?
MARIETTE	Like that!
GASTON	I know all your tricks.
MARIETTE	And you're going to fall for them.
GASTON	So you think you can get me?
MARIETTE	Any minute I want!
GASTON	You're conceited--
MARIETTE	But attractive--
GASTON	<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
MARIETTE	<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments! 

GASTON	I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
MARIETTE	I <u>must</u> go.
GASTON	I'm crazy about you!
MARIETTE	I know it.
GASTON	<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
MARIETTE	I <u>believe</u> you.
GASTON	Then why do you want to go?
MARIETTE	Because I want to make it tough for you.

MARIETTE	When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
GASTON	On the night table.
MARIETTE	But I don't want to be a lady.

MARIETTE	Ah, let me have a little fun.
GASTON	Please! 

GASTON	Thirty-three--
MARIETTE	No--thirty-five! 

MARIETTE	Yes, Gaston?
GASTON	What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
MARIETTE	I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
GASTON	Call the police?
MARIETTE	Instantly.
GASTON	Um-<u>hum</u> ...
MARIETTE	But why talk about robbery on a night like this?

GASTON	You look beautiful.
MARIETTE	Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
GASTON	Mariette!
MARIETTE	Yes, Gaston?
GASTON	You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
MARIETTE	<u>Adolph</u>?
GASTON	Adolph J. Giron.
MARIETTE	And you expect me to believe that?
GASTON	Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it. 

GASTON	Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
MARIETTE	I don't believe it!
GASTON	Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?

GASTON	It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
MARIETTE	Giron...!
GASTON	Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 

GASTON	Goodbye...
MARIETTE	Goodbye.
GASTON	It could have been marvelous ...
MARIETTE	Divine ...
GASTON	Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
MARIETTE	But it could have been glorious.
GASTON	Lovely.
MARIETTE	Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
GASTON	Goodbye ... 

MARIETTE'S VOICE	Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
GASTON'S VOICE	Yes, Madame Colet?
MARIETTE'S VOICE	Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
GASTON'S VOICE	Yes--uh--
MARIETTE'S VOICE	Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
GASTON'S VOICE	What is it, madame?
MARIETTE'S VOICE	I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.

MARIETTE'S VOICE	Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
GASTON'S VOICE	No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
MARIETTE'S VOICE	No, m'sieu!
GASTON'S VOICE	Yes, madame!
MARIETTE'S VOICE	Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.

MARIETTE	But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
GIRON	I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
MARIETTE	To M'sieu Laval?

GIRON	Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
MARIETTE	I know!
GIRON	Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
MARIETTE	He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
GIRON	You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
MARIETTE	Jacques!

MARIETTE	You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
LILY	Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
MARIETTE	Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.

LILY	Two lumps, madame?
MARIETTE	Please!  Thank you.
LILY	May I?

LILY	Yes, madame?
MARIETTE	You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
LILY	About what?
MARIETTE	Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
LILY	Naturally not!

MARIETTE	Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
LILY	Well--uh--yes and no.
MARIETTE	To me he seems rather nervous.
LILY	Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
MARIETTE	No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
LILY	So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
MARIETTE	Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
LILY	For all the really important things--
MARIETTE	Right!
LILY	I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
MARIETTE	Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
LILY	Very well, madame. Thank you. 

LILY	Yes, madame?
MARIETTE	How much is your salary?

MARIETTE	Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
LILY	Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 

MARIETTE	I think you'd better go.
LILY	Ever had a romance with a crook?
MARIETTE	I beg your pardon!
LILY	Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
MARIETTE	Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
LILY	I don't want your money!

MARIETTE	You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
MAJOR	He started it.
MARIETTE	But you're the more intelligent one.
MAJOR	That's true.
MARIETTE	Then why did you do it?
MAJOR	Because I hate him--because I love you!
MARIETTE	You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
MAJOR	Well, he was in the navy.

MAJOR	Your bag?
MARIETTE	Yes, my bag!
MAJOR	Didn't you take it with you?
MARIETTE	Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
MAJOR	No--I'm sorry.
MARIETTE	But you saw it here.
MAJOR	Yes, I saw it--but--
MARIETTE	Well, where is it?

ANDY	Wow!  Cool!
MRS. DAVIS	Whadda ya think?
ANDY	Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!

ANDY	Can we leave this up 'til we move?
MRS. DAVIS	Well, sure, we can leave it up.
ANDY	Yeah!
MRS. DAVIS	Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
ANDY	Okay.

MRS. DAVIS	Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
ANDY	Oh, yeah!

ANDY	To infinity and beyond!
MRS. DAVIS	Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
ANDY	Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!

ANDY	Can I bring some toys?
MRS. DAVIS	You can bring ONE toy...
ANDY	Just one?

ANDY	Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
MRS. DAVIS	No, I haven't seen him.

MRS. DAVIS	Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
ANDY	But Mom, I can't find him!
MRS. DAVIS	Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
ANDY	Okay...

ANDY	I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
MRS. DAVIS	Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.

ANDY	Can I help pump the gas?
MRS. DAVIS	Sure!  I'll even let you drive.

ANDY	Yeah?!
MRS. DAVIS	Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
ANDY	Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.

MRS. DAVIS	Next stop...
ANDY	Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!

ANDY	Mom, have you seen Woody?
MRS. DAVIS	Where was the last place you left him?
ANDY	Right here in the van.
MRS. DAVIS	Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
ANDY	He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.

MRS. DAVIS	I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
ANDY	But what if we leave them behind?
MRS. DAVIS	Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.

MRS. DAVIS	Everybody say, "Bye, house."
ANDY	Bye, house.

ANDY	Hey!  Wow!
MRS. DAVIS	What?  What is it?
ANDY	Woody!  Buzz!
MRS. DAVIS	Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
ANDY	Here!  In the car!
MRS. DAVIS	See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.

ANDY	Which one can I open first?
MRS. DAVIS	Let's let Molly open one.

WOODY	Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
BO PEEP	I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
WOODY	Oh, hey - it was nothing.
BO PEEP	Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
WOODY	Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...

WOODY	You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
BO PEEP	Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.

WOODY	Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
BO PEEP	I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.

BO PEEP	What are you doing over there?
WOODY	It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!

WOODY	We're almost there.
BO PEEP	Rocky!  The ramp!

WOODY	Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
BO PEEP	Merry Christmas, Sheriff.

WOODY	Say, isn't that mistletoe?
BO PEEP	Mm-hmmmmm.

WOODY	Hello-o-o...
BUZZ	HO-YAAAHH!!!

WOODY	Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
BUZZ	I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
WOODY	Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
BUZZ	Watch yourself!!

WOODY	Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
BUZZ	Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.

BUZZ	Toy?
WOODY	T-O-Y.  Toy.
BUZZ	Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
WOODY	The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.

WOODY	He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
BUZZ	Excuse me.

BUZZ	They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
WOODY	No, you can't.
BUZZ	Yes, I can.
WOODY	You can't!
BUZZ	Can!
WOODY	Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
BUZZ	I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
WOODY	Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
BUZZ	All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!

BUZZ	Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
WOODY	That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!

WOODY	Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
BUZZ	What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!

WOODY	And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
BUZZ	Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?

BUZZ	Don't even think about it, cowboy!
WOODY	Oh, yeah, tough guy?!

WOODY	You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
BUZZ	You're mocking me, aren't you?
WOODY	Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
BUZZ	Where?

BUZZ	What's going on?
WOODY	Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
BUZZ	I'd better take a look anyway.

BUZZ	Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
WOODY	That's why.  Sid.
BUZZ	Sure is a hairy fellah.
WOODY	No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!

WOODY	THAT is Sid!
BUZZ	You mean that happy child?

BUZZ	I could have stopped him.
WOODY	Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.

WOODY	Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
BUZZ	Trouble?!  Where?!
WOODY	Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
BUZZ	Then we've no time to lose!!

WOODY	Right?  Buddy?
BUZZ	I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
WOODY	Oh.  Oh, that's good.
BUZZ	But we're not on my planet, are we?
WOODY	No.

BUZZ	According to my nava-computer, the --
WOODY	Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
BUZZ	Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
WOODY	This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
BUZZ	My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
WOODY	Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
BUZZ	Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
WOODY	WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!

WOODY	Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
BUZZ	Go away.

BUZZ	Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
WOODY	Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
BUZZ	Well, then let's climb abroad.

WOODY	No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
BUZZ	Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.

WOODY	Ow!  Watch where you're going!
BUZZ	Sorry.

WOODY	Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
BUZZ	You mean it has hyperdrive?
WOODY	Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.

WOODY	C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
BUZZ	Where is it?  I don't see the --

BUZZ	Spaceship.
WOODY	Alright Buzz, get ready...

BUZZ	What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
WOODY	YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --

BUZZ	I've set my laser from stun to kill.
WOODY	Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.

WOODY	I sure hope this isn't permanent.
BUZZ	Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --

BUZZ	Woody, we don't know what's out there!
WOODY	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!

WOODY	They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
BUZZ	Shield your eyes!

BUZZ	It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
WOODY	Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!

WOODY	Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
BUZZ	Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
WOODY	Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!

BUZZ	Woody, stop it!!
WOODY	Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!

BUZZ	Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
WOODY	Don't tell me what to do!
BUZZ	Shhh!

WOODY	What happened to you?
BUZZ	One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.

WOODY	I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
BUZZ	Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 

BUZZ	Oh, I'm a sham!!
WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
BUZZ	Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!

BUZZ	But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
WOODY	Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!

WOODY	Come on, this way!
BUZZ	Years of Academy training...wasted!!

WOODY	Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
BUZZ	I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
WOODY	Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
BUZZ	Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
WOODY	Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
BUZZ	No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
WOODY	Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
BUZZ	Yeah, right.
WOODY	No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
BUZZ	But why would Andy want me?
WOODY	Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.

WOODY	Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
BUZZ	Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
WOODY	Yes Sir!

BUZZ	Woody!  It's the moving van.
WOODY	We've got to get out of here...NOW.

WOODY	Shhhhhhh!
BUZZ	What?!
WOODY	It's ok.  Everything's under control.

WOODY	Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
BUZZ	Woody!

BUZZ	Hold on, Woody!
WOODY	I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
BUZZ	NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!

WOODY	Well, thanks for the ride.
BUZZ	Look out!!

WOODY	Great!
BUZZ	Woody!  The rocket!
WOODY	The match!

BUZZ	Woody?!  What are you doing?
WOODY	Hold still, Buzz!

WOODY	Ha-ha!!
BUZZ	You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.

WOODY	Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
BUZZ	Not today!

WOODY	Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
BUZZ	This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
WOODY	Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!

WOODY	Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
BUZZ	We're not aiming for the truck!

BUZZ	Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
WOODY	Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!

WOODY	It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
HAMM	Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
WOODY	Stay calm, everyone!!

WOODY	No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
HAMM	Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
WOODY	Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!

WOODY	It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
HAMM	What's with him?

HAMM	Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
WOODY	Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!

WOODY	Hi!
HAMM	Everyone, it's Woody!

HAMM	Something's screwy here.
WOODY	So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.

HAMM	Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
MR. POTATO HEAD	I can't see a thing!

MR. POTATO HEAD	Hey, watch it!
HAMM	Sorry there, old Spudhead.

MR. POTATO HEAD	Let's string him up by his pull- string!
HAMM	I got dibs on his hat!

MR. POTATO HEAD	B-3.
HAMM	Miss.  G-6.
MR. POTATO HEAD	Ohhh!  You sunk it!
HAMM	Heh-heh.
MR. POTATO HEAD	Are you peeking?
HAMM	Oh, quit your whining and pay up.

HAMM	No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
MR. POTATO HEAD	How 'bout three out of five?

MR. POTATO HEAD	Son of a building block, it's Woody!
HAMM	He's in the psycho's bedroom!

HAMM	Oh, that is disgusting.
MR. POTATO HEAD	Murderer!

HANNAH	What?
SID	Did I get my package in the mail?
HANNAH	I dunno.
SID	Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
HANNAH	I don't know!
SID	Oh no, Hannah!
HANNAH	What?
SID	Look!  Janie!

HANNAH	Hey!!
SID	She's sick!
HANNAH	No she's NOT --
SID	I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
HANNAH	NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!

HANNAH	Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
SID	Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.

HANNAH	MOM!!  MOM!!
SID	She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!

REX	Oh, no!
MR. POTATO HEAD	Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!

MR. POTATO HEAD	Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
REX	Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --

MR. POTATO HEAD	Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
REX	Have you been replaced?

MR. POTATO HEAD	Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
REX	And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...

MR. POTATO HEAD	Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
REX	Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?

MR. POTATO HEAD	That ain't no happy child.
REX	He tortures toys -- just for fun.

MR. POTATO HEAD	Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
REX	Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!

REX	Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
MR. POTATO HEAD	Will you quit moving around?!
REX	I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
MR. POTATO HEAD	How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?

WOODY	Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
MR. POTATO HEAD	Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!

WOODY	A lunchbox?!
MR. POTATO HEAD	A lunchbox...?!

MR. POTATO HEAD	Laser-envy.
WOODY	All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --

MR. POTATO HEAD	Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
WOODY	Alright!  That's it!

MR. POTATO HEAD	Who is it this time?
WOODY	I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?

WOODY	Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
MR. POTATO HEAD	That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
WOODY	Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me

WOODY	Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
MR. POTATO HEAD	Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!

MR. POTATO HEAD	Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
WOODY	No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
MR. POTATO HEAD	You are a liar!
WOODY	No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.

MR. POTATO HEAD	Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
WOODY	Nothing.

WOODY	No!  No, no, no, no!
MR. POTATO HEAD	You murdering dog!
WOODY	No, it's not what you think, I swear!
MR. POTATO HEAD	Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!

WOODY	No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
MR. POTATO HEAD	Come on.  Let's get out of here.

WOODY	No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
MR. POTATO HEAD	Toss 'im overboard!
WOODY	No, no, no, wait!

REX	ROOAAAARR!!!
WOODY	Oh, how ya doin', Rex?

REX	Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
WOODY	I was close to being scared that time.

WOODY	C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
REX	But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
WOODY	Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.

WOODY	If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
REX	Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
WOODY	Okay, save your batteries!

REX	Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
WOODY	Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.

WOODY	Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
REX	Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?

WOODY	Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
REX	Hey look!  It's Buzz!
WOODY	Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!

REX	They're getting bigger.
SLINKY	Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!

SLINKY	What the heck is up there?
REX	Woody?  Who's up there with you?

SLINKY	It's Sid!
REX	I thought he was at summer camp!

SLINKY	We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
REX	Oh, I don't like confrontations.

SLINKY	It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
REX	There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.

SLINKY	I got it, Woody!
REX	He got it, Woody!

WOODY	Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
SARGENT	Sir!  No Sir!
WOODY	Okay, thank you.  At ease.

WOODY	Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
SARGENT	Yes SIR!

SARGENT	Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
WOODY	This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
SARGENT	Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.

SARGENT	Okay, we're on the last present now...
WOODY	Last present!
SARGENT	It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!

SARGENT	Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
WOODY	So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.

WOODY	There.
SARGENT	Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
WOODY	Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!

WOODY	Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
SARGENT	I can't quite make out -- 

SID	Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
WOODY	Uh-oh.

WOODY	Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
SID	Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?

WOODY	This is ludicrous.

SID	Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
WOODY	Sid!!!

WOODY	Reach for the sky!!
SID	Huh?

WOODY	This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
SID	What?!

WOODY	Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
SID	It's busted.

SID	W-w-w-we?
WOODY	That's right.  Your toys.

WOODY	Hey, Slinky?
SLINKY	Right here, Woody!

SLINKY	I'm red this time.
WOODY	No, Slink --
SLINKY	Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
WOODY	Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
SLINKY	Bad news?!
WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!

WOODY	Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
SLINKY	Got it.

SLINKY	Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
WOODY	Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.

SLINKY	Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
WOODY	Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.

SLINKY	Woody?!
WOODY	We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?

WOODY	Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
SLINKY	I knew you'd come back, Woody!

WOODY	Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
SLINKY	See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.

SLINKY	Woody!  Speed up!
WOODY	Speed up!

SLINKY	I can't hold on much longer!
WOODY	Slink!  Hang on!

ANASTASIA	Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Yes, my dear, he is.
ANASTASIA	And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
ANASTASIA	Oh, shit.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.

BURGOMEISTER	Frederick Frankenstein?
FREDDY	You have the wrong house.
BURGOMEISTER	And who might you be?
FREDDY	Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
BURGOMEISTER	The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
FREDDY	No!
BURGOMEISTER	What was your grandfather's name?
FREDDY	Victor Frankenstein.

BURGOMEISTER	Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
FREDDY	Ugly, vicious rumous.

BURGOMEISTER	They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
FREDDY	Poppycock!

FREDDY	I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
BURGOMEISTER	Now wait a minute!

FREDDY	Where did you get this cauliflower?
CARLSON	From your office, sir.
FREDDY	Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
CARLSON	Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
FREDDY	Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?

CARLSON	No, sir.  It will never happen again.
FREDDY	Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.

FREDDY	Give him an extra dollar.
CARLSON	Yes, sir.

CARLSON	Yes, sir.
FREDDY	He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.

FREDDY	Carlson!
CARLSON	Yes, sir?
FREDDY	Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
CARLSON	Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
FREDDY	... No!

CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
HERR FALKSTEIN	I did, sir.

HERR FALKSTEIN	But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
HERR FALKSTEIN	Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
HERR FALKSTEIN	'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'

CORNELIUS WALDMAN	Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
HERR FALKSTEIN	Yes, sir.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN	I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!

ELIZABETH	What in God's name are you doing?
MONSTER	Baack!
ELIZABETH	What?
MONSTER	Baack!

ELIZABETH	You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
MONSTER	MMMmmmm.
ELIZABETH	All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.

MONSTER	MMMmm!
ELIZABETH	Is it that music?
MONSTER	MMMMM!  MMMMM!
ELIZABETH	Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.

ELIZABETH	Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
MONSTER	MMmmm.

ELIZABETH	Still happy you married me?
MONSTER	MMmmm.
ELIZABETH	Love me oodles and oodles?
MONSTER	MMmmm.
ELIZABETH	So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
MONSTER	MMmmm.

IGOR	Darling!
ELIZABETH	Hello...?
IGOR	Surprised?
ELIZABETH	Well... yes.
IGOR	Miss me?
ELIZABETH	I...

ELIZABETH	Darling!...you will be careful!?
FREDDY	Of course.
ELIZABETH	You have your tickets?
FREDDY	Yes.
ELIZABETH	And your passport?
FREDDY	Yes, don't worry.
ELIZABETH	Call me from New York before you leave??
FREDDY	Yes.
ELIZABETH	Promise??
FREDDY	I promise.
ELIZABETH	Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
FREDDY	Oh, darling -- so will I.

ELIZABETH	Will you miss me?
FREDDY	Very....very!
ELIZABETH	Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
FREDDY	Oh, nice.
ELIZABETH	I hope you like large weddings.
FREDDY	Whatever makes you happy.
ELIZABETH	I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
FREDDY	You're incorrigible!
ELIZABETH	Does that mean you love me?
FREDDY	You bet your boots it does.

FREDDY	I will!  Goodbye, darling!
ELIZABETH	Goodbye, darling.

ELIZABETH	Goodbye, darling.
FREDDY	Goodbye, darling!

ELIZABETH	Darling!
FREDDY	Darling!

ELIZABETH	Surprised?
FREDDY	Surprised!
ELIZABETH	Love me?
FREDDY	Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?

ELIZABETH	Darling!?!
FREDDY	I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.

FREDDY	Ready, darling?
ELIZABETH	Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
FREDDY	Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?

ELIZABETH	What a strange fellow.
FREDDY	Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
ELIZABETH	Why does he call you 'master'?

FREDDY	Are you suggesting I call him master???
ELIZABETH	No, of course not.  I just meant...
FREDDY	All right then!

FREDDY	Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
ELIZABETH	Darling, you mustn't worry so.

FREDDY	But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
ELIZABETH	But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
FREDDY	Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
ELIZABETH	You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
FREDDY	I suppose you're right.
ELIZABETH	Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.

ELIZABETH	Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
FREDDY	Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
ELIZABETH	Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.

FREDDY	I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
ELIZABETH	Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
FREDDY	That's a tough choice.
ELIZABETH	Is it worth taking a chance?
FREDDY	I suppose you're right.
ELIZABETH	Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.

FREDDY	Good night.
ELIZABETH	That's my good boy.

FRAU BLUCHER	I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
FREDDY	It seems fine.
FRAU BLUCHER	You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
FREDDY	Does that include the key to the laboratory?

FRAU BLUCHER	You mean... the laboratory??
FREDDY	Yes!... the laboratory.
FRAU BLUCHER	No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
FREDDY	May I have it, please?

FREDDY	There seem to be quite a few books.
FRAU BLUCHER	Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
FREDDY	I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
FRAU BLUCHER	I don't know what you mean, sir.
FREDDY	well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
FRAU BLUCHER	This is the only library I know of.
FREDDY	Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
FRAU BLUCHER	I think you must be mistaken, sir.

FREDDY	Well... we'll see.
FRAU BLUCHER	Will there be anything else?
FREDDY	I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
FRAU BLUCHER	I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
FREDDY	Good.

FREDDY	What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
FRAU BLUCHER	This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
FREDDY	Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.

HERR FALKSTEIN	Dr. Frankenstein?
FREDDY	Fron kon steen!
HERR FALKSTEIN	My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

HERR FALKSTEIN	Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
FREDDY	But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
HERR FALKSTEIN	Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?

FREDDY	How long will this whole thing take?
HERR FALKSTEIN	A week.  Ten days at most.
FREDDY	I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...

FREDDY	Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
HERR FALKSTEIN	Why did you do that?
FREDDY	What?
HERR FALKSTEIN	Break that old man's violin.
FREDDY	I didn't do that.
HERR FALKSTEIN	The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.

FREDDY	All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
HERR FALKSTEIN	Yes, sir.
FREDDY	One week at the most!?
HERR FALKSTEIN	One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
FREDDY	Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.

HERR FALKSTEIN	Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
FREDDY	Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
HERR FALKSTEIN	Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!

FREDDY	That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
MEDICAL STUDENT	I beg your pardon?
FREDDY	My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
MEDICAL STUDENT	Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
FREDDY	No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
MEDICAL STUDENT	But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
FREDDY	That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!

FREDDY	I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
MEDICAL STUDENT	Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
FREDDY	Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?

FREDDY	In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
MEDICAL STUDENT	Dr. Fronkonsteen!
FREDDY	Yes?

MEDICAL STUDENT	Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
FREDDY	A piece of what?
MEDICAL STUDENT	Vermicelli.
FREDDY	Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.

MEDICAL STUDENT	But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
FREDDY	My father was a sick man.
MEDICAL STUDENT	But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
FREDDY	You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.

MEDICAL STUDENT	Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
FREDDY	How old are you, young man?
MEDICAL STUDENT	Nineteen, sir.
FREDDY	Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
MEDICAL STUDENT	But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
FREDDY	Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
MEDICAL STUDENT	But, sir...
FREDDY	I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.

FREDDY	You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
MEDICAL STUDENT	But your grandfather's work, sir...
FREDDY	My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!

IGOR	Frederick Frankenstein?
FREDDY	Fron kon steen!
IGOR	Are you putting me on?
FREDDY	No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
IGOR	And do you also say Fro dereck?
FREDDY	No, Fred ereck.
IGOR	Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
FREDDY	It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
IGOR	I see.
FREDDY	You must be Igor.

IGOR	No, it's pronounced Aye gor.
FREDDY	But they told me it was Ee gor.
IGOR	Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
FREDDY	You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?

IGOR	Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
FREDDY	I'm sure we will.
IGOR	This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
FREDDY	How do you do?

IGOR	Are these your bags?
FREDDY	Yes, just the two.

FREDDY	Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
IGOR	What hump?

IGOR	There.
FREDDY	I beg your pardon?
IGOR	There wolf!  There castle!
FREDDY	Why are you talking like that?
IGOR	I thought you wanted to.
FREDDY	No.

IGOR	Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
FREDDY	What wockers?
IGOR	The wockers with the knockers.
FREDDY	Wockers with the knockers???
IGOR	Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.

IGOR	Home!
FREDDY	Home.

IGOR	Down!  Get down, you beasts!
FREDDY	I wonder what's got into them?

FREDDY	Aye-gor!
IGOR	Fro-derick!
FREDDY	What are you doing here?
IGOR	I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.

FREDDY	But what you were doing?
IGOR	Just putting up some tea.
FREDDY	Did you hear that strange music?
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	Did you hear that strange music??
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	Did you hear that strange music?

FREDDY	It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
IGOR	Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.

FREDDY	Did you see anyone else down here?
IGOR	No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.

FREDDY	What is this place?
IGOR	Must be the music room.

FREDDY	It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
IGOR	'How I Did It.'  Good title!
FREDDY	Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?

IGOR	Taking the book along?
FREDDY	Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.

FREDDY	What a filthy job!
IGOR	Could be worse!
FREDDY	How?
IGOR	Could be raining!

FREDDY	Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
IGOR	I have a pretty good idea.

FREDDY	Do you have the name I wrote down?
IGOR	Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
FREDDY	I want that brain.
IGOR	Was he any good?
FREDDY	Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.

IGOR	Hmm!
FREDDY	And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
IGOR	That's not bad.
FREDDY	Can you imagine that brain in this body?
IGOR	I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
FREDDY	He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
IGOR	Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
FREDDY	Why?
IGOR	It's always been one of my favorite names.
FREDDY	If you like -- just hurry!
IGOR	Thank you, Master.

IGOR	You're sure you know what you're doing?
FREDDY	Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!
IGOR	Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.

IGOR	You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
FREDDY	All right... elevate me!

FREDDY	The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
IGOR	Tonight?
FREDDY	Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
IGOR	You've got it, master.

FREDDY	Throw the second switch!
IGOR	This guy means business.

FREDDY	It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	More, do you hear me?
IGOR	What?
FREDDY	Throw the third switch!
IGOR	Wait till he sees the bill.

IGOR	You can't win 'em all.
FREDDY	But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.

FREDDY	Cold!  Cold and dead!
IGOR	You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.

FREDDY	Don't try to cheer me up that way.
IGOR	Well, I don't like to see you mope.

IGOR	You'll be getting me sad next.
FREDDY	I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.

IGOR	I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
FREDDY	You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.

FREDDY	Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
IGOR	Who are you talking to?
FREDDY	To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
IGOR	I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
FREDDY	But you did -- I just heard it.
IGOR	It wasn't me.

IGOR	Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
FREDDY	I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.

FREDDY	It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
IGOR	Don't fall for that one.
FREDDY	But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
IGOR	careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.

IGOR	Original.
FREDDY	Give -- me -- your -- hand!

FREDDY	Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
IGOR	You can say that again.
FREDDY	Yes.
IGOR	You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
FREDDY	Why?

IGOR	What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
FREDDY	I'm not trying to be funny.

IGOR	Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
FREDDY	... I'm glad that's...
IGOR	No, no!  That whole thing!
FREDDY	... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.

IGOR	It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
FREDDY	Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
IGOR	Yes, Master!
FREDDY	Act casual!

IGOR	How's it going?
FREDDY	What did you find out?
IGOR	Someone was playing this in the music room.

FREDDY	Where is he?
IGOR	How do you know it was a 'he'?
FREDDY	All right -- where is she?
IGOR	How do you know it was a 'she'?
FREDDY	Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
IGOR	Can you play it?
FREDDY	Maybe...if you get here on time.

FREDDY	Thanks...for all your help.
IGOR	That's what we're paid for.

FREDDY	I'm a failure.
IGOR	Come on, Froderick -- none of that.

FREDDY	What monster?
IGOR	What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.

IGOR	You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
FREDDY	What???
IGOR	He's carrying her off now through the woods.

FREDDY	No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
IGOR	That sound good, boss.
FREDDY	... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
IGOR	I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
FREDDY	There's only one way.
IGOR	I'll bet it's a doozy.

IGOR	Come on, big fellow!
FREDDY	Is everything ready?
IGOR	Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
FREDDY	It's the only way.
IGOR	Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.

MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?
FREDDY	It's alive!

FREDDY	Hello there.
MONSTER	MMMMMmmmmmmm.
FREDDY	How's everything?
MONSTER	MMMmmmmmmmm.
FREDDY	I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MONSTER	MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
FREDDY	Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?

FREDDY	It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
MONSTER	... It's.

FREDDY	Get the sedative ready!
MONSTER	MMmmm!  MMmmm!

MONSTER	Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
FREDDY	Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
MONSTER	Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
FREDDY	Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
MONSTER	Soo -- pah doo -- per.

MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
FREDDY	...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................

MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
FREDDY	For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!

MONSTER	MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
FREDDY	Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??

MONSTER	MMMmmmmmm.
FREDDY	Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?

FREDDY	What's that tune that you're playing
OLD VIOLINIST	Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
FREDDY	How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.

FREDDY	May I see your violin?
OLD VIOLINIST	It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
FREDDY	Oh, just a little.

FREDDY	Nice!  Nice little balance to it.
OLD VIOLINIST	Ja, ja.

INGA	Extremely well.
FREDDY	How nice.

INGA	Did you have a pleasant trip?
FREDDY	Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.

INGA	Did you ever have a roll in the hay?
FREDDY	I'm not sure I...get your drift.

INGA	Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.
FREDDY	Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.

INGA	Are you busy?
FREDDY	That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
INGA	Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
FREDDY	We only arrived a few minutes ago.
INGA	I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
FREDDY	Well...
INGA	Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
FREDDY	Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.

FREDDY	Would you like a sandwich?
INGA	No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
FREDDY	Well... I'll just finish unpacking.

FREDDY	Inga!
INGA	Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
FREDDY	Inga, wake up!
INGA	What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
FREDDY	Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
INGA	Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
FREDDY	I don't know.  It just woke me up.

INGA	Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
FREDDY	Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
INGA	Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
FREDDY	All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!

INGA	Ooh!
FREDDY	What a filthy mess.

INGA	Look, Doctor!
FREDDY	Well, this explains the music.
INGA	But who was playing it?

INGA	Oh, doctor!
FREDDY	Perhaps we'd better leave.

FREDDY	'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
INGA	And look at this, Doctor!
FREDDY	'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'

FREDDY	Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
INGA	Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
FREDDY	A god?
INGA	Yes!
FREDDY	I know.

INGA	Right here?
FREDDY	Raise the platform, hurry!
INGA	Oh!  Yes, Doctor.

FREDDY	Reputation.  Reputation!
INGA	I thought it was wonderful.
FREDDY	I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.

INGA	It wasn't me.
FREDDY	Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...

INGA	Oh, Doctor!
INGA	I think you've done it, master.
FREDDY	Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!

FREDDY	It looks that way.
INGA	What do you think we should do?

INGA	What are you going to do?
FREDDY	I think I'll...carry him.

FREDDY	Do you think you can sing it?
INGA	Me?  Sing?
FREDDY	Yes -- quickly, dear!

INGA	I'd be so nervous.
FREDDY	This is not the finals -- just sing!
INGA	It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'

INGA	It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
FREDDY	Stop -- singing!!!

FREDDY	All right -- give it to him!
INGA	Are you serious??
FREDDY	Give him the sedative!
INGA	Oh!  Yes, Doctor.

FREDDY	Did you do it?
INGA	I think so.
FREDDY	Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.

INGA	Good night, Doctor.
FREDDY	Good night!

INGA	Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
FREDDY	Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!

FREDDY	Just passing through the night.
INGA	What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
FREDDY	Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
INGA	I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.

FREDDY	It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
INGA	Not fooling around.
FREDDY	I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
INGA	I see what you mean.
FREDDY	There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
INGA	I know Frederick.

FREDDY	It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
INGA	Of course not.

INGA	What?
FREDDY	I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
INGA	Nor to Elizabeth.
FREDDY	No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
INGA	We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.

INGA	And Elizabeth has hers.
FREDDY	Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
INGA	But, after all, you have yours.

FREDDY	Yes, I have mine.
INGA	And I have mine.

FREDDY	Yes...yes, you have yours.
INGA	Why don't we talk inside?
FREDDY	Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.

INGA	Yes, I know.
FREDDY	It wouldn't be fair to her.
INGA	Yes, I know.
FREDDY	You've got to help me to remain faithful.
INGA	Yes, I will.
FREDDY	...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!

INGA	All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
FREDDY	MMmmm.

FREDDY	MMMMmmmmm!
INGA	Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.

INGA	Are you ready for me?
FREDDY	MMMMmmmmm!
INGA	Ready for Fuchsmachen???
FREDDY	MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
INGA	I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.

INGA	Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
FREDDY	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

IGOR	No, not sound.
INGA	There must have been someone else down here then.

IGOR	His what??
INGA	His schwanzstucker.
IGOR	Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.

INGA	It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
IGOR	Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?

INGA	I'm getting tired.
IGOR	Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.

INGA	Look how far we've come.
IGOR	You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
INGA	I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
IGOR	Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?

IGOR	How do you know they're done?
INGA	The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.

IGOR	How long is it so far?
INGA	Four
IGOR	Three minutes to go!
INGA	Yes.
IGOR	What d'ya want to do to kill time?
INGA	Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.

INGA	Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?
IGOR	Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.

IGOR	Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.

IGOR	Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.
INGA	Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!

IGOR	Another fifteen seconds to go.
INGA	Do Something!  Stall them!

MAITRE D'	Yes, sir, name, please?
MONSTER	Food!
MAITRE D'	Do you have a reservation?
MONSTER	Food!!
MAITRE D'	I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.

MONSTER	Drink!
MAITRE D'	Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.

MONSTER	Foooooood!
MAITRE D'	Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
MONSTER	GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
MAITRE D'	Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
