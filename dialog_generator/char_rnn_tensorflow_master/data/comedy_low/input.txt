KRUGER	Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
COMMISSIONER	Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.

KRUGER	And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
COMMISSIONER	Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.

COMMISSIONER	You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
KRUGER	Commissioner.

COMMISSIONER	What?
KRUGER	I just wish it was that simple.

KRUGER	That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
COMMISSIONER	That just doesn't make any sense.
KRUGER	I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
COMMISSIONER	I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
KRUGER	You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!

KRUGER	Forget it.  I was reading.
COMMISSIONER	I was reading too.
KRUGER	What's the story?
COMMISSIONER	Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
KRUGER	I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.

KRUGER	Kruger, Sagittarius.
COMMISSIONER	Commissioner, Aquarius.

DUNN	Did you feel that?
MARY	Yes I did...
DUNN	Felt like a large asteroid.
MARY	Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
DUNN	What is it, Mary?
MARY	Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.

DUNN	Oveur.
OVEUR	Dunn.

OVEUR	Shut down accelerators.
DUNN	Accelerators down.

DUNN	We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
OVEUR	You better check it, Unger.

DUNN	Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
OVEUR	You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.

OVEUR	Dunn.
DUNN	Sir?
OVEUR	You better take this.

TED	Elaine.
ELAINE	Te...!
TED	That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.

TED	It's got to be stopped!
ELAINE	But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
TED	I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.

ELAINE	Ted, what's wrong?
TED	Ask Simon.

ELAINE	Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
TED	There's nothing wrong with me!
ELAINE	Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
TED	You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!

TED	Elaine.
ELAINE	Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.

TED	Elaine, what happened to us?
ELAINE	Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.

ELAINE	Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
ELAINE	Who's that, Ted?
TED	Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.

TED	Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
ELAINE	And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.

TED	His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
ELAINE	Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.

TED	No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
ELAINE	If that's the way you want it.
TED	That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
ELAINE	Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.

ELAINE	Ted!  What are you...?
TED	I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.

ELAINE	Ted, we're taking off!
TED	Let me by, Elaine.

ELAINE	What are you doing, Ted?
TED	I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!

ELAINE	Ted.
TED	Not now, Elaine!
ELAINE	Ted!

TED	Elaine.
ELAINE	Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
TED	Elaine, we have to go back.
ELAINE	We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
TED	Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.

ELAINE	Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
TED	Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
ELAINE	I've never used the word insane, Ted.
TED	What word would you use, Elaine?
ELAINE	The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
TED	What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
ELAINE	I'd use the word insane.
TED	There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
ELAINE	Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.

TED	Elaine!
ELAINE	Ted!
TED	Elaine, what's going on?
ELAINE	Ted, there's no time to explain.

TED	Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
ELAINE	Ted, please be careful.

ELAINE	Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
TED	Not now, Elaine.
ELAINE	I mean until we start to burn up.

TED	Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
ELAINE	That was very well put, Ted.

TED	Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
ELAINE	I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
TED	That might be the news we've been waiting for.

ELAINE	Simon just ejected!
TED	Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
ELAINE	You mean...
TED	That's right -- premature ejection.
ELAINE	What will happen to him, Ted?
TED	The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.

TED	Are you afraid?
ELAINE	Not when I'm with you, Ted.
TED	I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.

TED	We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
ELAINE	Set!
TED	Now!
ELAINE	Compute!

ELAINE	Ted, the lever!
TED	Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.

ELAINE	Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
RUMACK	The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...

RUMACK	So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
ELAINE	What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?

RUMACK	You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
ELAINE	I mean for Ted.
RUMACK	You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
ELAINE	Is that a good sign, Doctor?

RUMACK	The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
ELAINE	Is he making any progress, Doctor?
RUMACK	Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.

SIMON	For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
ELAINE	Simon.
SIMON	Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
ELAINE	And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.

SIMON	Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
ELAINE	But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
SIMON	You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.

SIMON	Frank's the best pilot in the program.
ELAINE	I'm so excited, Simon.
SIMON	I guess this is a first for you.
ELAINE	No, I've been excited before.

SIMON	Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
ELAINE	Simon, why has he become so... so...
SIMON	So mentally ill?

SIMON	Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
ELAINE	Don't be too long.

SIMON	Have you got it straightened out now?
ELAINE	I think so.
SIMON	That's my girl.

ELAINE	Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
SIMON	Roger.

ELAINE	Simon, what's happening?!
SIMON	He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
ELAINE	Can't we change course?
SIMON	We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.

SIMON	My career is shot.
ELAINE	Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?

ELAINE	Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
SIMON	Maybe.
ELAINE	Simon, what are you saying?!

OVEUR	Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
ELAINE	Yes, sir.

ELAINE	I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
OVEUR	I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
ELAINE	We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.

OVEUR	Roger.
ELAINE	You can do it from up here, Captain.
OVEUR	I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
ELAINE	No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
OVEUR	Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.

ELAINE	Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
ROK	Negative.
ELAINE	That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
ROK	Negative.
ELAINE	That's not possible.
ROK	Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.

ROK	Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
ELAINE	That's okay, ROK.
ROK	Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
ELAINE	Go ahead.
ROK	You have great tits.

ELAINE	Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
ROK	Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
ELAINE	Request; life support systems check.
ROK	Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
ELAINE	Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
ROK	There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.

JIMMY	Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
JOHN	We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.

JIMMY	I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
JOHN	I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
JIMMY	Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
JOHN	It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.

JOHN	How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
JIMMY	No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
JOHN	Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!

OVEUR	Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
JIMMY	Scraps.
OVEUR	Can I hold him?
JIMMY	Sure.
OVEUR	He's a boy dog.
JIMMY	Yeah.
OVEUR	Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?

WIFE	Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
JOE	We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
WIFE	Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
JOE	I don't want to hear that word!
WIFE	Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
JOE	All right.  Here.
WIFE	What...?

TED	Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
JOE	I don't want to live anymore.
TED	Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
JOE	What?
TED	That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
JOE	You're sure?
TED	I'm sure.

OVEUR	A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
MARY	How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
OVEUR	No.  Poached.  Over.
MARY	Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
OVEUR	Just poached on toast.  Over.

OVEUR	That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
MARY	All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
OVEUR	Poached!  Not over!  Over!

MARY	Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
OVEUR	Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?

TED	Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
MARY	Sixteen 'C', why?
TED	He's carrying a bomb.
MARY	A b...

TED	No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
MARY	What should I say?
TED	Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.

SIMON	Captain Oveur?
OVEUR	Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
SIMON	We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.

SIMON	That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
OVEUR	Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?

OVEUR	Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
SIMON	Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.

SIMON	Whenever your're ready, Captain.
OVEUR	Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.

PORTER	You folks need any help?
STELLA	Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
PORTER	Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
STELLA	Yes.
PORTER	It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
STELLA	Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
PORTER	Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
STELLA	Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.

TED	I have to see Bud Kruger.
RECEPTIONIST	Do you have an appointment, sir?
TED	No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
RECEPTIONIST	You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
TED	All right, it's a matter of death.
RECEPTIONIST	Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.

RECEPTIONIST	You can't go in there!
TED	Don't try to stop me!
RECEPTIONIST	But that's not a door.  The door's over there.

TED	Are you on the Mercury mission?
SIMON	That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.

SIMON	You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
TED	Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
SIMON	You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
TED	I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.

SIMON	Striker.
TED	Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
SIMON	That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
TED	Then Elaine was right.
SIMON	Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
TED	Pull yourself together!  We've got to...

STELLA	Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
TED	Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
STELLA	You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
TED	Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
STELLA	Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
TED	I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
STELLA	You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.

STELLA	You've been hurt.
TED	I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
STELLA	No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.

STELLA	Do you want to talk about it.
TED	I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
STELLA	No.  I mean your relationship.
TED	We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
STELLA	Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
TED	People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
STELLA	Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
TED	Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
STELLA	Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
TED	I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.

STELLA	No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
TED	Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.

PHOEBE	What's happening?
BOBBIE	Debbie's marrying Rick.
PHOEBE	...Really?

BOBBIE	Does Cole know about this?
PHOEBE	Really -- you went with him for two years.

PHOEBE	I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
BOBBIE	Deb, I want to throw you a shower.

PHOEBE	Look at that guy. What a hunk.
BOBBIE	Check out the other guy's buns.

BOBBIE	Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
DEBBIE	Bobbie, what are you talking about?
BOBBIE	O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.

DEBBIE	He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
BOBBIE	He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
DEBBIE	No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.

DEBBIE	What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
BOBBIE	They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
DEBBIE	What do you mean?
BOBBIE	I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
DEBBIE	You're kidding.
BOBBIE	Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 

BOBBIE	That's what we're going to find out...
DEBBIE	I feel like I'm spying on Rick.

BOBBIE	Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
DEBBIE	Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.

CHULO	I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
O'NEILL	Rick's got an important announcement to make.
CHULO	Yeah. What is it?

O'NEILL	What?
CHULO	You're kidding.

CHULO	Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
O'NEILL	Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.

CHULO	Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
O'NEILL	Chulo, one thing at a time.
CHULO	Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.

O'NEILL	I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
CHULO	Women!

CHULO	Hey, you guys, what's going on?
RICK	We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
CHULO	Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?

RICK	I've decided not to run for President.
CHULO	Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.

CHULO	Man, you're losing your audience.
RICK	Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.

RICK	Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
CHULO	Hey, man, congratulations!

RYKO	You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
CHULO	Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
RYKO	I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
CHULO	What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?

RYKO	All right!
CHULO	When do the girls get to the party?

RYKO	Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
CHULO	I'd like to jerk and press those babies.

COLE	And...
RICK	Bond... James Bond.

RICK	Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
COLE	I want Debbie.
RICK	Cole...
COLE	You dump her and I'll give you cash.
RICK	What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
COLE	Five thousand dollars.
RICK	No.

COLE	Seventy-five hundred.
RICK	Not interested.
COLE	Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
RICK	I'm marrying Debbie.
COLE	Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
RICK	What is this person's story here?

RICK	Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
COLE	He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
RICK	Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.

COLE	Rick, I want to talk to you.
RICK	Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.

COLE	I don't want any trouble.
RICK	Oh, come on, just a little.
COLE	I'm ready to make you another deal.
RICK	Ooh, be still, my heart.
COLE	See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.

COLE	Great car.
RICK	The best.
COLE	I love that car.
RICK	I'm very happy for you two.

COLE	I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
RICK	The car for Debbie?
COLE	I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
RICK	Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?

COLE	Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
RICK	So does Debbie.

COLE	Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
RICK	Maybe it had something to do.
COLE	Shit!

COLE	Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
RICK	Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
COLE	You've had it. I'm gonna get you.

RICK	Cole, what the hell are you doing?
COLE	She's mine!

COLE	He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
RICK	Fan out and look for them.

MR. T	Hello?
COLE	Mr. Thomerson.
MR. T	Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
COLE	Yes I did.
MR. T	Fine. How's everything going?
COLE	Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...

COLE	Hi, everybody. Am I late?
MR. THOMERSON	Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.

MR. THOMERSON	So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
COLE	Sure have...

MR. THOMERSON	Nice shot.
COLE	Thank you, sir.
MR. THOMERSON	I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
COLE	Yes, sir, I am.
MR. THOMERSON	Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
COLE	I've tried to change her mind.
MR. THOMERSON	It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
COLE	But how can I do that?
MR. THOMERSON	If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.

COLE	Thanks for the advise, sir.
MR. THOMERSON	Keep me informed.

MR. THOMERSON	So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
COLE	What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.

COLE	Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
MR. THOMERSON	Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
COLE	Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
MR. THOMERSON	Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.

MR. THOMERSON	Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
COLE	The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
MR. THOMERSON	Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
COLE	1002.
MR. THOMERSON	All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
COLE	Yes, sir.

DEBBIE	Cole?
COLE	Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.

DEBBIE	Cole, we've got to talk.
COLE	Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
DEBBIE	No, Cole, I...
COLE	It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
DEBBIE	Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
COLE	You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
DEBBIE	Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
COLE	You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
DEBBIE	I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.

COLE	You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
DEBBIE	Cole, I'm sorry, I...
COLE	That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
DEBBIE	I'm going now, Cole.
COLE	I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.

DEBBIE	God, you're a slob.
RICK	But a fabulous cook.
DEBBIE	What are we having?
RICK	It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
DEBBIE	I think your dinner's burning.

RICK	Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
DEBBIE	Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
RICK	Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
DEBBIE	You're going to have a bachelor party?
RICK	Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
DEBBIE	It looks awful.
RICK	Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
DEBBIE	Are you going to have women at your party?
RICK	No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
DEBBIE	I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
RICK	Oh, those. Why do you ask?
DEBBIE	Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.

RICK	Huh? Wha...
DEBBIE	I can't sleep.
RICK	Oh... I got something for that.

DEBBIE	Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
RICK	What's the matter?
DEBBIE	I don't know... I just feel scared.
RICK	About what?
DEBBIE	The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
RICK	I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
DEBBIE	Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
RICK	C'mere.

DEBBIE	That feels so great.
RICK	Good...
DEBBIE	Um... that's very relaxing.
RICK	Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.

RICK	Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
DEBBIE	You better not have too much joy.
RICK	Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
DEBBIE	Gonna get married...

RICK	This is it, lady. Last stop.
DEBBIE	Can't I just go with you guys?
RICK	Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.

DEBBIE	Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
RICK	Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
DEBBIE	You're really pissing me off.

RICK	Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
DEBBIE	Your mother's not dead.
RICK	Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.

DEBBIE	Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
RICK	Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
DEBBIE	I love you.

DEBBIE	Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
RICK	How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
DEBBIE	Why don't you get undressed.

DEBBIE	I can't trust you!
RICK	C'mon, I knew it was you.
DEBBIE	Rick, you're lying!

DEBBIE	Let go of me!
RICK	Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
DEBBIE	The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
RICK	I don't want that. I want to be with you.
DEBBIE	And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
RICK	I am committed. I love you.

DEBBIE	I don't believe you.
RICK	You don't believe me? Okay, fine.

RICK	See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
DEBBIE	Yes...
RICK	Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
DEBBIE	Let's get naked.
RICK	You're on.

RICK	Are you okay?
DEBBIE	Yeah.
RICK	This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
DEBBIE	You're so romantic...

ILENE	If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
DEBBIE	Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
ILENE	Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
DEBBIE	Ilene, Rick promised...
ILENE	Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.

DEBBIE	Are you sure this is a good idea?
ILENE	Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
DEBBIE	That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
ILENE	Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.

DEBBIE	Let's go.
ILENE	Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
DEBBIE	Ilene, are you crazy?
ILENE	I know what I'm doing... Go!

MRS. THOMERSON	I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
DEBBIE	Great, Mom.

DEBBIE	Why is Cole here?
MRS. THOMERSON	You know your father enjoys his company.

MRS. THOMERSON	A strange wang right in my palm.
DEBBIE	Ilene, we don't really know that.

MRS. THOMERSON	What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
DEBBIE	Quiet, Mother.

MRS. THOMERSON	I hope Ilene's all right.
DEBBIE	I hope those guys are all right.

EXECUTIVE	Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
MR. THOMERSON	My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.

EXECUTIVE	Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
MR. THOMERSON	A real turd.
EXECUTIVE	Well... hope she'll be very happy.

MR. THOMERSON	Great bathing suit.
EXECUTIVE	I think I screwed that one once.

EXECUTIVE	Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
MR. THOMERSON	Any time, Al.

GARY	So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
JUMBO	Let's see your bread.

GARY	Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
JUMBO	They'll be up there in a half hour.
GARY	Okay. Nice to meet you both.

GARY	Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
JUMBO	What are you talking about, asshole?
GARY	Your whores never showed up.
JUMBO	They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
GARY	Screw you!

JUMBO	That's it, prick lips.
GARY	What are you...
JUMBO	I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
GARY	Why?
JUMBO	Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.

GARY	This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
JUMBO	Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.

JUMBO	Give him the works.
GARY	That's more like it.

GARY	Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
RICK	Gary, you're quite an animal.
GARY	Screw you...

GARY	Let's go.
RICK	Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.

GARY	Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
RICK	All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.

GARY	Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
RICK	Because I love her. What can I tell you?

RICK	Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
GARY	Let's have a toast.

RICK	Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
GARY	What's going on?

RICK	It's true.
GARY	This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
RICK	Guy paints a beautiful picture.
GARY	I'm going to see what the hell happened.
RICK	Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
GARY	Screw that.

RICK	Hookers beat you up?
GARY	Yes.
RICK	I didn't know you were into that.

RICK	Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
GARY	Rick, I really think I'm in love.
RICK	This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.

RAJAH	What can I be doing for you?
GARY	You're a pimp?
RAJAH	I'm telling you I am, Joe.
GARY	I want women.
RAJAH	That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
GARY	I'll take some.
RAJAH	Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
GARY	I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
RAJAH	You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
GARY	Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
RAJAH	Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
GARY	Milt?

O'NEILL	So, Larry, how have you been?
LARRY	Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.

LARRY	I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
O'NEILL	Larry, you and your wife got problems?
LARRY	I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.

O'NEILL	Is that all the coke in the place?
LARRY	That's it.
O'NEILL	Good.

LARRY	You want to share it?
RICK	Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
LARRY	Right.

LARRY	My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
RICK	Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
LARRY	She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
RICK	What do you mean, it changes?

LARRY	Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
RICK	C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
LARRY	I just want to be alone.
RICK	All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."

RICK	Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
LARRY	No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.

RICK	You okay?
LARRY	Yeah, I guess so.
RICK	Really?
LARRY	Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.

RICK	What the hell are you doing?
LARRY	I'm trying to slash my wrists.
RICK	You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
LARRY	I couldn't find any razor blades.
RICK	Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
LARRY	Ha, ha, ha.
RICK	No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.

RICK	Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
LARRY	It's Bullwinkle.

LARRY	It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
RICK	It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...

RICK	Are any of those right?
MANAGER	This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
RICK	Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.

MANAGER	It's on the tenth floor.
RICK	What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.

MANAGER	Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
RICK	I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.

MANAGER	You're all under arrest. Open up!
RICK	Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!

RICK	Oops!
MR. THOMERSON	All right, who serves?

MR. THOMERSON	Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
RICK	Can't I just maim it a little?

RICK	Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
MR. THOMERSON	Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
RICK	I'd love that.
MR. THOMERSON	Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
RICK	Mr. Thomerson, I...
MR. THOMERSON	Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
RICK	Feel free.
MR. THOMERSON	First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...

RICK	Welcome, welcome, one and all.
MR. THOMERSON	Rick!
RICK	Oh, no!

RICK	The end.
MR. THOMERSON	No sob story is going to change my mind.

MR. THOMERSON	Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
RICK	Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.

MRS. THOMERSON	Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
MR. THOMERSON	No. Let's at least finish the set.

MRS. THOMERSON	Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
MR. THOMERSON	In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.

MR. THOMERSON	The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
MRS. THOMERSON	You can tell a man by his friends.

MRS. THOMERSON	Ed... you're kinky!
MR. THOMERSON	The phone made me do it!
MRS. THOMERSON	You've been having strange sex...!
MR. THOMERSON	No, Brett, I...
MRS. THOMERSON	It's all right...  So have I.

O'NEILL	How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
WOMAN	Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
O'NEILL	Mrs.?
WOMAN	I'm separated.
O'NEILL	Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.

O'NEILL	I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
WOMAN	Of course.

O'NEILL	Where'd she go?
RICK	She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.

O'NEILL	Where the hell is he?
RICK	Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.

O'NEILL	What's the matter?
RICK	Nothing... Let's get crazy!

O'NEILL	We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
RICK	Olivier's in that, right?
O'NEILL	Then it's on to the real thing.

RICK	Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
O'NEILL	This isn't right.

RICK	Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
O'NEILL	Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
RICK	I'm not really hungry.
O'NEILL	C'mon. I insist.

RICK	What the hell is that?
O'NEILL	My gift to you.
RICK	Under the table!
O'NEILL	The best table in the house.

RICK	I think you'll enjoy this table.
O'NEILL	So long, Father.

O'NEILL	I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
RICK	I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.

O'NEILL	Rick, I'm concerned.
RICK	About what?
O'NEILL	This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
RICK	Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
O'NEILL	I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
RICK	Oooooo.
O'NEILL	Right in there, pal.
RICK	If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
O'NEILL	That's the old Rick!

O'NEILL	How'd it go?
RICK	Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
O'NEILL	I'm proud of you, lad.

RICK	Who was that?
O'NEILL	I don't know.
RICK	What's this?
O'NEILL	Got me.

RICK	How 'bout this?
O'NEILL	Still drawing a blank.

RICK	He look familiar?
O'NEILL	Very.
RICK	C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.

RICK	Now, don't get into any trouble.
O'NEILL	Take care.

O'NEILL	Hey, you guys...
RICK	Who's your friend?

RICK	How about this, a Trojan donkey.
O'NEILL	And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...

O'NEILL	What are you going to do about it?
RICK	What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
O'NEILL	I'll stop him... You stall him.

O'NEILL	Reach out and snort someone.
RICK	I'm saved. Let's party!

O'NEILL	Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
RICK	Who?
O'NEILL	Debbie.
RICK	My Debbie?
O'NEILL	What's with her costume?

RICK	I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
O'NEILL	You got it.

RICK	You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
STAN	Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
RICK	True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
STAN	You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
RICK	Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?

RICK	That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
STAN	Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.

RICK	Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
STAN	Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.

STAN	Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
RICK	Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
STAN	Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
RICK	Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.

STAN	Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
RICK	Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?

SISTER MARY FRANCIS	You're late again, Rick.
RICK	I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
SISTER MARY FRANCIS	There can be no excuse for tardiness.
RICK	You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.

RICK	Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
SISTER MARY FRANCIS	Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
RICK	Right... Think it over.

STAN	How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
RYKO	I don't know.
STAN	What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
RYKO	Maybe I did... I don't remember.
STAN	I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.

RYKO	Can you believe how perfect it fits?
STAN	Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.

KING ARNULF	Open up! I know you're in there!
AUD	Ah! It's my father!
KING ARNULF	Open up! I know you're in there!

KING ARNULF	Right! Where is he?
AUD	Who, Father?
KING ARNULF	Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
AUD	There IS no one.

KING ARNULF	Well... where is he?
AUD	There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.

KING ARNULF	Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
AUD	You're losing your temper!

AUD	It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
KING ARNULF	I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...

AUD	There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
KING ARNULF	She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
AUD	It's your fantasy...
KING ARNULF	But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...

KING ARNULF	It's all right! It isn't happening!
AUD	But, Father, it IS!

AUD	It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
KING ARNULF	Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...

ERIK	WHAT did you say?
AUD	I said welcome.
ERIK	WELCOME?
AUD	Well, of course. We always welcome friends.

ERIK	How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
AUD	Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.

AUD	Please! Please! What are those?
ERIK	What are what?
AUD	Those things in your hands.
ERIK	These? What are THESE? They're swords.

ERIK	What's the matter?
AUD	PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
ERIK	What?
AUD	Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.

AUD	WHY?
ERIK	Yes.
AUD	But surely you know...?

AUD	Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
ERIK	What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
AUD	No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
ERIK	You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
AUD	No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
ERIK	HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
AUD	What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
ERIK	It was different...
AUD	What was she like?
ERIK	Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
AUD	But you LOVED her all the same...
ERIK	We never went to bed together.
AUD	Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
ERIK	You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
AUD	I've never LOVED anybody!
ERIK	I've never been to bed with anybody!

AUD	The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
ERIK	The fifth one this week!
AUD	Oh, for goodness' sake!
ERIK	And I thought you said it was something special...

AUD	That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
ERIK	Five this week; how many the week before?
AUD	You're as bad as my father.
ERIK	And the week before that?

ERIK	We mustn't let him land!
AUD	Who?
ERIK	Halfdan the Black.
AUD	But, Erik...

ERIK	Just give me a hand.
AUD	I mean, you could have killed yourself.

ERIK	Where's the Cloak Invisible?
AUD	Why?

AUD	No!
ERIK	I'll bring it back.
AUD	Erik. You don't understand.
ERIK	No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
AUD	But you don't realize....
ERIK	Goodbye, Aud...

ERIK	And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
AUD	No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!

AUD	No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
ERIK	That's right!

AUD	No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
ERIK	I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!

AUD	YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
ERIK	Of course.
AUD	Do you believe I love you?
ERIK	I... but I...
AUD	You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
ERIK	Yes -- I believe you do.
AUD	Then let go!

AUD	The second note.
ERIK	The second note to wake the Gods...

AUD	Erik! You've done what you came to do!
ERIK	Not quite...

AUD	Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
ERIK	There is something I must ask the Gods...
AUD	No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.

AUD	Then I shall come too.
ERIK	No... no...
AUD	I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
ERIK	But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...

ERIK	LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
LOKI	Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.

ERIK	But --
LOKI	It was my master Keitel's idea.

ERIK	But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
LOKI	What d'you mean?

LOKI	How do we know this is the way?
ERIK	We blew the Horn Resounding.
LOKI	SHE blew the Horn Resounding.

FREYA	Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
ERIK	I shouldn't have come.
FREYA	They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?

FREYA	What do you see, Erik?
ERIK	I see the world.
FREYA	Is it night or day, Erik?
ERIK	It is day, of course, Freya.
FREYA	Is it summer or winter, Erik?

FREYA	Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
ERIK	The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
FREYA	But have you ever seen it? Think back...
ERIK	Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
FREYA	The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.

ERIK	Is there nothing men can do?
FREYA	The Gods are asleep, Erik.
ERIK	I will go and wake them up!

ERIK	And will the dead ever return, Freya?
FREYA	That I cannot tell you.

ERIK	No... we don't...
KING ARNULF	The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.

ERIK	How?
KING ARNULF	Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
ERIK	Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
KING ARNULF	Well... isn't it great?

KING ARNULF	Would you like us to sing to you?
ERIK	That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...

KING ARNULF	What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
ERIK	Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
KING ARNULF	You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
ERIK	Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
KING ARNULF	A lot of people like our singing.
ERIK	I'm sure it's lovely.
KING ARNULF	But you don't want to hear it.
ERIK	No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?

ERIK	Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
KING ARNULF	You're just saying that.

ERIK	Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
KING ARNULF	REALLY?
ERIK	Really.
KING ARNULF	And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?

ERIK	No. 
KING ARNULF	Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"

KING ARNULF	We're just not a very musical nation...
ERIK	No, no... It was very... er, nice.
KING ARNULF	Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?

ERIK	No.
KING ARNULF	They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!

ERIK	Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
KING ARNULF	Well, how d'you think I feel?
ERIK	The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
KING ARNULF	YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...

KING ARNULF	I'll tell you what...
ERIK	Yes?

KING ARNULF	Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
ERIK	You've got to let me go!

KING ARNULF	It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
ERIK	They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!

ERIK	He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
KING ARNULF	Why?
ERIK	Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
KING ARNULF	Don't talk nonsense.
ERIK	He wants to kill US!
KING ARNULF	Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
ERIK	You don't know Halfdan the Black.
KING ARNULF	I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.

KING ARNULF	Is there something the matter with it?
ERIK	Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
KING ARNULF	Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
ERIK	Yes... oh, yes...
KING ARNULF	Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.

ERIK	But it IS! Look!
KING ARNULF	The important thing is not to panic.

HELGA	Have you done this sort of thing before?
ERIK	Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
HELGA	Looting and pillaging, eh?
ERIK	Yes.
HELGA	What about the raping?
ERIK	Shut up.
HELGA	It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
ERIK	Sh!

ERIK	Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
HELGA	You don't love ME.
ERIK	No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
HELGA	What -- rape?
ERIK	No. It isn't rape then, is it?
HELGA	Oh, get it over with.
ERIK	I don't suppose... no...
HELGA	What?
ERIK	I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
HELGA	What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...

ERIK	I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
HELGA	About raping me?
ERIK	About NOT raping you...
HELGA	You DON'T like it, do you?
ERIK	Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
HELGA	What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
ERIK	Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
HELGA	Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
ERIK	To pay for the next expedition, of course.
HELGA	But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
ERIK	Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
HELGA	Well you started it.
ERIK	I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
HELGA	And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.

ERIK	Scream.
HELGA	Ah.
ERIK	Louder.
HELGA	Aaagh! Rape!
ERIK	Oh, thanks.

HELGA	Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
ERIK	I didn't mean to!
HELGA	Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...

ERIK	You told them I raped you -- why?
HELGA	I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
ERIK	Why should you care?
HELGA	Why... should YOU care?
ERIK	Tell me your name?

ERIK	I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
HELGA	What a stupid idea.
ERIK	Why?
HELGA	What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
ERIK	I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!

HELGA	Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
ERIK	Well... no...

ERIK	Is THAT Odin?
HELGA	You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
ERIK	Odin!

HELGA	Why should you care?
ERIK	I don't know! I just did!

THORFINN	FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
ERIK	Find it... AND cross it!

ERIK	But what?
THORFINN	But...
ERIK	What?

THORFINN	Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
ERIK	He was lucky...  Sit there.

THORFINN	What are you talking about?
ERIK	Come on, move it!

THORFINN	It's Halfdan the Black!
ERIK	I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!

THORFINN	Erik! Row! What are you doing?
ERIK	It saved my father!

ERIK	How deep IS the ocean?
THORFINN	Very deep... usually...

THORFINN	Let's hack her to pieces.
ERIK	No.

ERIK	What's wrong with making friends?
THORFINN	You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".

THORFINN	That's terrible!
ERIK	You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?

THORFINN	Halfdan the Black's here!
ERIK	I know!
THORFINN	He wants to KILL us.

ERIK	But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
THORFINN	I know. I know.

ERIK	It's not magic! It's just a trick!
THORFINN	Don't you FEEL it?

GRANDFATHER	We're missing all the fun...
ERIK	What's it all about?
GRANDFATHER	What?
ERIK	We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
GRANDFATHER	You talking piffle, son?
ERIK	Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
GRANDFATHER	Who have you been talking to?
ERIK	I met this girl...
GRANDFATHER	It's always the women that start the trouble.
ERIK	She got me thinking...
GRANDFATHER	So? What'd you do to her?

ERIK	I... I... KILLED her...
GRANDFATHER	That's my boy!

IVAR	He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
ERIK	Well, you ARE!

IVAR	I want to die...  No, I don't!
ERIK	Row! Row! Row!

ERIK	Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
IVAR	Sorry.

ERIK	Slower! In... Out...
IVAR	Sorry!

ERIK	Faster!
IVAR	Make your mind up.

ERIK	What are YOU doing here?
SVEN'S DAD	You may need a real Berserk.

SVEN'S DAD	Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
ERIK	Shut up. You there. You there and you there.

SVEN'S DAD	SHUT UP!
ERIK	ROW!

ERIK	Look, the sky is blue...
SVEN'S DAD	The sun! That's it!

SVEN'S DAD	It's magic.
ERIK	What "magic"?
SVEN'S DAD	I've heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.

SVEN'S DAD	What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
ERIK	You'll see!

SVEN'S DAD	What did he say?
ERIK	Look out!

ERIK	You must help us.
ODIN	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
ERIK	Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
ODIN	Why should WE care?
ERIK	Because... you're... you're the Gods....
ODIN	So?
ERIK	Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.

ODIN	Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
ERIK	But you're the Gods!
ODIN	Look... Erik...

SNORRI	You mean we'd be dead?
ERIK	No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.

SNORRI	Thank you VERY much indeed.
ERIK	Now stop it!
SNORRI	It's SO nice to feel wanted.
ERIK	Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
SNORRI	Trust me to get the missionary.

SNORRI	You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
ERIK	That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
SNORRI	Now you've got all the big ones on one side.

ERIK	That's better.
SNORRI	Now you've got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.

ERIK	Row!
SNORRI	Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?

SNORRI	First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
ERIK	Well, come on!

ERIK	Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
SNORRI	Like fish.

SNORRI	A magic dishcloth.
ERIK	To the oars!

SNORRI	Weren't we supposed to?
ERIK	Oh... I feel a little... oh...

ERIK	No! Let go, Snorri!
SNORRI	I've got you!
ERIK	You'll be sucked down too!
SNORRI	No! Arrgh!

ERIK	There is another way.
GRANDAD	Who gets killed?
ERIK	Nobody gets killed.

GRANDAD	You need to say a bit more than that!
ERIK	Oh... er... yes...

ERIK	What's the matter with them?
GRANDAD	Just say something cheerful.
ERIK	Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!

GRANDAD	I think we should go...
ERIK	Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
GRANDAD	No, don't say anything else!

KEITEL	Wait, Erik!
ERIK	Keitel Blacksmith?

KEITEL	Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
ERIK	What's the matter with Bjorn?

ERIK	What do you think?
KEITEL	But how could he know... unless...

ERIK	And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
KEITEL	But...

KEITEL	Well, what else do we do?
ERIK	How about making friends?

ERIK	So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
KEITEL	What is it?

KEITEL	Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
ERIK	What are you talking about?

ERIK	And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
SVEN	I will join my grandfather there.

SVEN	What are you talking about, Erik?
ERIK	What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?

SVEN	Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
ERIK	What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?

SVEN	Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
ERIK	We'd be the first!

SVEN	But HOW?
ERIK	I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.

ERIK	Hey, you two! What's going on?
SVEN	I was sitting there.

SVEN	Look, I bagged it last week.
ERIK	It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
SVEN	Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
ERIK	Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
SVEN	I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.

SVEN	I AM one, Dad!
ERIK	We haven't got a spare place.

ERIK	ROW!
SVEN	DEATH!

SVEN	She hasn't got any.
ERIK	She MUST have a knife or something...

SVEN	Hy-Brasil?
ERIK	Is THIS Hy-Brasil?

ERIK	We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
SVEN	Over the Edge of the World.

ERIK	Sven!
SVEN	Let me do something for myself for a change!

SVEN	I came to find my grandfather.
ERIK	I have to go...

GIRL	Bye, Leif.
LEIF	Bye... sorry...
GIRL	Yeah... well...
LEIF	You will wait?
GIRL	What d'you expect me to do?

LEIF	That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
GIRL	Please.

HARALD	What's all the panic about?
SVEN'S DAD	The Dragon...

HARALD	It can't do you any HARM...
SVEN'S DAD	What do we have to do?
HARALD	Nothing... I just immerse you in water...

HARALD	How did he do that?
SVEN'S DAD	Do what?
HARALD	Vanish into thin air?
SVEN'S DAD	He hasn't.
HARALD	Well, where is he then?

SNORRI	You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
HARALD	I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
SNORRI	You're wasting your time.
HARALD	Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
SNORRI	There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
HARALD	Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
SNORRI	Same thing, isn't it?
HARALD	No, it is NOT.

HARALD	You know, my son, our lord said...
SNORRI	Your lord.
HARALD	Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
SNORRI	I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.

THORFINN	Are you all right?
IVAR	No, I'm not.
THORFINN	You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
IVAR	How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
THORFINN	I mean many of the greatest sailors were.

IVAR	I know. I know.
THORFINN	Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
IVAR	Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.

THORFINN	He used to puke in his sleep.
IVAR	Bastard.

THORFINN	Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
IVAR	That's it!

THORFINN	And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
IVAR	That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
THORFINN	Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!

IVAR	Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
THORFINN	Mum! Dad!

KEITEL	Aaagh!
SVEN	Got you!

KEITEL	Let me go, Sven.
SVEN	What are you talking about?
KEITEL	I'm not worth risking your life for.
SVEN	I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
KEITEL	For your own sake... For the others... I...
SVEN	Hang on...

SNORRI	Well! Come on!
KEITEL	I... I...

SNORRI	Who's that?
KEITEL	It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
SNORRI	Oh...

KEITEL	What?
SNORRI	What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
KEITEL	Get away, Snorri.
SNORRI	What have you got there?

LOKI	Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
KEITEL	Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
LOKI	You could charge him what you like.

LOKI	You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
KEITEL	Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
LOKI	Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...

LOKI	If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
KEITEL	Can't make enough swords!
KEITEL	Can't make enough axe-heads!
LOKI	But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..

KEITEL	They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
LOKI	The Age of Ragnarok ends...
KEITEL	The bottom falls out of the sword business!
LOKI	It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
KEITEL	My brother blacksmiths!
LOKI	That's right.
KEITEL	The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
LOKI	Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
KEITEL	Together we stand!
LOKI	You can't let Erik do THAT.

LOKI	Wasn't it, Keitel?
KEITEL	Well... I... I thought...

LOKI	Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
KEITEL	How can we stops him now?

LOKI	Sh! Hurry!
KEITEL	YOU do it!
LOKI	You'll be able to throw it further than I could.

LOKI	I can't swim! I can't swim!
KEITEL	Relax!
LOKI	I'm drowning! Help!

KEITEL	Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
LOKI	Help!
KEITEL	You'll drown us bo...

KEITEL	Help!
LOKI	Help!

LOKI	Shut up!
KEITEL	She knows it was our fault!
LOKI	Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
KEITEL	No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!

LOKI	You've lost your mind.
KEITEL	We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
LOKI	You fool!

LOKI	I should have got rid of you long ago!
KEITEL	Like you got rid of Snorri!

KEITEL	Made by YOU, Loki!
LOKI	By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
KEITEL	It's not my business any more!

SVEN'S DAD	It's a tradition.
SVEN	I know, Dad.
SVEN'S DAD	I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
SVEN	You went berserk...
SVEN'S DAD	I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
SVEN	So did your father...
SVEN'S DAD	So did my father and his father before him.
SVEN	But it's a responsibility...
SVEN'S DAD	But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
SVEN	I must only let the red rage...
SVEN'S DAD	You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
SVEN	I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!

SVEN	We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
SVEN'S DAD	Not now, Sven...
SVEN	I must KILL! Kill!
SVEN'S DAD	It's no good going berserk against a dragon!

SVEN	KILL! KILL!
SVEN'S DAD	Stop it!

SVEN'S DAD	HOLD it! HOLD it in!
SVEN	DEATH TO DRAGONS!

SVEN	Well, of course he is!
SVEN'S DAD	Sh!

SVEN'S DAD	There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
SVEN	I'm just building up to it, Dad.

SVEN'S DAD	Well, go on! Go berserk!
SVEN	GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!

SVEN	There is nothing we can do...
SVEN'S DAD	Helpless...

SVEN'S DAD	He drove me mad!
SVEN	Easy, Dad!
SVEN'S DAD	And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
SVEN	Dad!
SVEN'S DAD	I hate you! I hate you!

THORFINN	He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
SVEN	You liar!

THORFINN	Well I'M certainly not, either.
SVEN	Neither am I.

SVEN	Well... I'm game.
THORFINN	Me too.

SVEN	Shut up.
THORFINN	Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.

SVEN	Thorfinn! You can't die!
THORFINN	I'm not frightened... of anything...
SVEN	You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
THORFINN	No... he's not... not... there...
SVEN	Tell him I'm coming!

THORFINN'S MUM	And you've got BOTH axes?
THORFINN	Yes, Mother.
THORFINN'S MUM	And something to sharpen them with?
THORFINN	Yes, Mum.
THORFINN'S MUM	And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
THORFINN	No, Mother.
THORFINN'S MUM	And keep your sword greased.
THORFINN	Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.

THORFINN'S MUM	And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
THORFINN	I never do...

SISSY	I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
CHINK	I know who you are.
SISSY	Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
CHINK	Save your breath for the climb.

SISSY	But I don't know how to polka.
CHINK	Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.

SISSY	What was that?
CHINK	Clockworks.
SISSY	Clockworks?

CHINK	The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
SISSY	Siwash, huh?
CHINK	He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.

CHINK	But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
SISSY	The Clock People?

CHINK	During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
SISSY	Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
CHINK	The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.

SISSY	What do you believe in then?
CHINK	Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

SISSY	Is everything getting worse?
CHINK	Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
SISSY	The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!

CHINK	I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
SISSY	She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
CHINK	You mean she's dead?

SISSY	But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
CHINK	Easy come, easy go.

SISSY	Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
CHINK	The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.

CHINK	Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
SISSY	How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
CHINK	That's your problem.

HOWARD	Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
SISSY	I'm staying with the Countess.
HOWARD	I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
SISSY	I don't.
HOWARD	You don't?
SISSY	Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.

HOWARD	A traveler, eh?
SISSY	You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.

SISSY	Where are the others?
HOWARD	Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.

JELLY	Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
SISSY	Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
JELLY	Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...

SISSY	No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
JELLY	Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.

SISSY	Tell me about it.
JELLY	About...
SISSY	About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
JELLY	Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'

SISSY	You're political, then?
JELLY	No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."

JELLY	Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
SISSY	Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
JELLY	Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.

JELLY	......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
SISSY	What is Debbie's position?
JELLY	Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
SISSY	You don't agree with Debbie, then?
JELLY	I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.

SISSY	That's Jellybean!
JELLY	FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.

JELLY	Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
SISSY	So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
JELLY	Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
SISSY	How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?

SISSY	No, I guess not.
JELLY	'Drugged' is a stupid word.
SISSY	But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.

JELLY	Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
SISSY	If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....

JULIAN	Extraordinary!
THE COUNTESS	She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
JULIAN	Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
THE COUNTESS	It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
JULIAN	Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
THE COUNTESS	Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
JULIAN	I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
THE COUNTESS	She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?

JULIAN	How does she like what in bed?
THE COUNTESS	Like what?

THE COUNTESS	What do you think?
JULIAN	Well.... er...
THE COUNTESS	Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
JULIAN	Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
THE COUNTESS	Whose fault was that?
JULIAN	I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
THE COUNTESS	What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
JULIAN	If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
THE COUNTESS	Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
JULIAN	What guy?
THE COUNTESS	Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.

SISSY	I'm cold.
JULIAN	Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
SISSY	It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.

JULIAN	What are you doing?
SISSY	Getting dressed. I've got to go.
JULIAN	But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
SISSY	I have to go, Julian.
JULIAN	Why? Why do you have to go?
SISSY	My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.

SISSY	Going north?
MAN	You bet your raggedy white ass I am.

MAN	Thanks.
SISSY	American Cheese. The king of road food.

MAN	Are you in show business?
SISSY	I was a successful model once.
MAN	For magazines?
SISSY	I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
MAN	So now you're bummin' around?
SISSY	Yep.
MAN	Hitchhiking?
SISSY	I'm the best.
MAN	You're the best?
SISSY	When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
MAN	Whooee!
SISSY	As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.

THE COUNTESS	To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
SISSY	Tired...
THE COUNTESS	That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
SISSY	A born freak can only go uphill.
THE COUNTESS	Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
SISSY	I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
THE COUNTESS	Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
SISSY	Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?

THE COUNTESS	You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
SISSY	Bonanza Jellybean?
THE COUNTESS	What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.

THE COUNTESS	She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
SISSY	Your ranch?
THE COUNTESS	Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.

THE COUNTESS	Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
SISSY	A job for me?
THE COUNTESS	I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.

SISSY	The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
THE COUNTESS	Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.

SISSY	If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
THE COUNTESS	Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
SISSY	But Countess...
THE COUNTESS	Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.

THE COUNTESS	But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
SISSY	Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
THE COUNTESS	Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
SISSY	What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
THE COUNTESS	I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
SISSY	Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
THE COUNTESS	Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.

THE COUNTESS	Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
SISSY	I don't know anything about it.
THE COUNTESS	Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...

HAROLD	Miss me, baby?
LOOSELEAF	I dunno, boy.
HAROLD	Hm?
LOOSELEAF	It's a bitch.
HAROLD	A bitch.
LOOSELEAF	Didn't recognize you.
HAROLD	We've never met.
LOOSELEAF	I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
HAROLD	I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
LOOSELEAF	I'm gonna wet my pants.

HAROLD	Home, sweet home.
LOOSELEAF	One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
HAROLD	We'll see.

HAROLD	It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
LOOSELEAF	Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
HAROLD	Home is important to a man.
LOOSELEAF	You know what gets me?
HAROLD	No.
LOOSELEAF	How all the magazines show tits today.
HAROLD	Um.
LOOSELEAF	Used to be against the law, didn't it?
HAROLD	I suppose.
LOOSELEAF	Must have changed that law.

HAROLD	Home.
LOOSELEAF	You know what gets me?

LOOSELEAF	You know what gets me?
HAROLD	Oh, shit.
LOOSELEAF	How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
HAROLD	Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
LOOSELEAF	At least we found the diamonds.
HAROLD	At least!
LOOSELEAF	I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
HAROLD	It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
LOOSELEAF	I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
HAROLD	Tell them yourself!
LOOSELEAF	You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
HAROLD	After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
LOOSELEAF	I didn't tell you everything.
HAROLD	The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
LOOSELEAF	I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
HAROLD	This room is full of ghosts.
LOOSELEAF	You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.

LOOSELEAF	You know what gets me?
HAROLD	Go home!
LOOSELEAF	Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
HAROLD	The hell with the diamonds!
LOOSELEAF	You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
HAROLD	Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
LOOSELEAF	Can I have the Cadillac?
HAROLD	Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
LOOSELEAF	What'll you do for transportation?
HAROLD	I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
LOOSELEAF	You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
HAROLD	Go home!
LOOSELEAF	When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
HAROLD	Go home.
LOOSELEAF	I'm liable to find anything!
HAROLD	That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
LOOSELEAF	I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
HAROLD	So long, Colonel.
LOOSELEAF	You know what gets me?
HAROLD	Let's talk about it some other time.
LOOSELEAF	How short the skirts are.
HAROLD	Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
LOOSELEAF	Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.

LOOSELEAF	You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
HAROLD	Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
LOOSELEAF	Months?
HAROLD	I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
LOOSELEAF	I'm lonesome already.

LOOSELEAF	I've been looking at motorcycles.
HAROLD	Go home!
LOOSELEAF	You ever own a motorcycle?
HAROLD	You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
LOOSELEAF	Haven't got one.

HAROLD	And how were things?
LOOSELEAF	Let's talk about something else.

HAROLD	Otherwise, how are things?
LOOSELEAF	I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.

HAROLD	Could have happened to anybody.
LOOSELEAF	First Nagasaki--now this.
HAROLD	How about breakfast, wife?

LOOSELEAF	I dunno, boy.
HAROLD	The educational process.
LOOSELEAF	I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
HAROLD	She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.

HAROLD	What's funny about that?
LOOSELEAF	You know me, boy.

LOOSELEAF	Excuse me.
HAROLD	One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
LOOSELEAF	Huh.
HAROLD	He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
LOOSELEAF	He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
HAROLD	How do you know that?
LOOSELEAF	You told me.
HAROLD	When?
LOOSELEAF	When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
HAROLD	Oh.  I'd forgotten.
LOOSELEAF	Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
HAROLD	Really?
LOOSELEAF	You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
HAROLD	Sorry.

LOOSELEAF	Go to the funeral?
HAROLD	Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
LOOSELEAF	That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
HAROLD	Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
LOOSELEAF	Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
HAROLD	When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
LOOSELEAF	I didn't know we had any women left.
HAROLD	The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
LOOSELEAF	Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.

LOOSELEAF	I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
HAROLD	It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
LOOSELEAF	You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.

LOOSELEAF	So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
HAROLD	He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.

HAROLD	Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
LOOSELEAF	I dunno.
HAROLD	You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
LOOSELEAF	Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
HAROLD	All the more reason to go to Africa.
LOOSELEAF	I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
HAROLD	You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
LOOSELEAF	I dunno.
HAROLD	She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.

LOOSELEAF	Hi, Penelope.
HAROLD	Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!

HAROLD	Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
HAROLD	What's this?
LOOSELEAF	I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
HAROLD	In what way, pray tell?
LOOSELEAF	I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
HAROLD	Tit for tat--as simple as that.
LOOSELEAF	You never played a violin.
HAROLD	You did?
LOOSELEAF	Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
HAROLD	Maybe it's time you got out.
LOOSELEAF	Me?
HAROLD	You.
LOOSELEAF	Okay.  Okay.
HAROLD	You're an imbecile.
LOOSELEAF	I know you think that.
HAROLD	Everybody thinks that.
LOOSELEAF	Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
HAROLD	The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
LOOSELEAF	I don't think so.  It could have been.
HAROLD	If what?
LOOSELEAF	If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
HAROLD	They were enemies.  We were at war.
LOOSELEAF	Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
HAROLD	Goodbye, Looseleaf.

SHUTTLE	Hello.
HAROLD	How are you, honeybunch?
SHUTTLE	Is Penelope in?
HAROLD	The posies are for her?
SHUTTLE	I wanted to apologize.
HAROLD	You've come to the right man.
SHUTTLE	I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
HAROLD	I forget mine for years on end.
SHUTTLE	Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.

SHUTTLE	I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
HAROLD	Our pleasure.
SHUTTLE	Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
HAROLD	For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
SHUTTLE	Blue soup.
HAROLD	It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.

SHUTTLE	Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
HAROLD	I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
SHUTTLE	Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
HAROLD	What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
SHUTTLE	Pass the fucking catsup.

HAROLD	Insurance!
SHUTTLE	You actually sold insurance!

SHUTTLE	What an awful sound!
HAROLD	Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.

HAROLD	It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
SHUTTLE	I've considered that.
HAROLD	Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
SHUTTLE	I just want one true adventure before I die.
HAROLD	That can be arranged.

HAROLD	Fifty years?
SHUTTLE	You're making a joke.
HAROLD	I'm interested in long-term expectations.
SHUTTLE	It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
HAROLD	Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.

SHUTTLE	If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
HAROLD	Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!

SHUTTLE	Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
HAROLD	What?
SHUTTLE	We got to get another pilot.
HAROLD	For what?
SHUTTLE	For Africa.
HAROLD	Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
SHUTTLE	You invited me.
HAROLD	To make an ass of yourself.
SHUTTLE	What went wrong?
HAROLD	We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
SHUTTLE	Gee whiz--
HAROLD	It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
SHUTTLE	I wouldn't drop my gun.
HAROLD	You're hollow, like a woman.
SHUTTLE	I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
HAROLD	He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
SHUTTLE	How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
HAROLD	Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
SHUTTLE	You're my buddy.
HAROLD	Out!  Out!
SHUTTLE	No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
HAROLD	Out!
SHUTTLE	You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
HAROLD	Thank God!

PAUL	Anybody home?
HAROLD	As a matter of fact--
PAUL	Sir?
HAROLD	As a matter of fact--I am home.
PAUL	Hello.
HAROLD	Hello.
PAUL	Are you--

HAROLD	You were about to ask a question?
PAUL	Are you--do you--
HAROLD	Ask it!
PAUL	Do you know who Wanda June is?
HAROLD	Life has denied me that thrill.
PAUL	Do you mind if I ask who you are?
HAROLD	Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
PAUL	Dr. Woodly.
HAROLD	Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
PAUL	Is anybody besides you here now?
HAROLD	The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
PAUL	Where's Mom?
HAROLD	You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
PAUL	She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
HAROLD	You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
PAUL	I'll see.

HAROLD	And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
PAUL	I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
HAROLD	Man and boy.
PAUL	Everybody says he was so brave.
HAROLD	Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
PAUL	He worships Father.
HAROLD	Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
PAUL	He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
HAROLD	I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
PAUL	She met him at college.
HAROLD	College!
PAUL	They were in the same creative writing class.
HAROLD	College?
PAUL	She has a master's degree in English literature.
HAROLD	What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
PAUL	He insults him all the time.
HAROLD	Excellent!
PAUL	What's good about that?
HAROLD	It makes life spicy.
PAUL	He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
HAROLD	No.
PAUL	Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy.
HAROLD	What does he do--of an athletic nature?
PAUL	Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
HAROLD	Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
PAUL	He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
HAROLD	Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
PAUL	Tell me some true stories about Dad.
HAROLD	Dad?  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
PAUL	England?
HAROLD	Oh hell.
PAUL	Dad was never in England?
HAROLD	Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
PAUL	The sting.
HAROLD	As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
PAUL	The sting.
HAROLD	Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
PAUL	Tell me that.
HAROLD	I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
PAUL	Tell me that!  Tell me that!
HAROLD	Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
PAUL	Wow.
HAROLD	We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
PAUL	Mhravitch.
HAROLD	We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
PAUL	Uck.
HAROLD	Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
PAUL	I don't know.
HAROLD	The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
PAUL	Go on.
HAROLD	We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
PAUL	Where did you get the poison?
HAROLD	We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
PAUL	And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."

HAROLD	Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
PAUL	Mhravitch.
HAROLD	The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
PAUL	When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
HAROLD	It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
PAUL	Sir?
HAROLD	The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
PAUL	I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
HAROLD	You're supposed to get hurt!
PAUL	Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
HAROLD	Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
PAUL	They're not engaged.
HAROLD	He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
PAUL	Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
HAROLD	You're a very good boy to respond that way.
PAUL	No, no, no, no, no.
HAROLD	I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
PAUL	Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.

HAROLD	Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
PAUL	Sir?

HAROLD	Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
PAUL	Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
HAROLD	Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
PAUL	She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
HAROLD	Why don't you go to bed--son.
PAUL	I can't take my eyes off you.
HAROLD	Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
HAROLD	Can't it keep till morning?
PAUL	She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
HAROLD	That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
PAUL	Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
HAROLD	Penelope!
PAUL	She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
HAROLD	Penelope!
PAUL	She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
HAROLD	Will you go to bed?
PAUL	Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
HAROLD	Scat!

PAUL	Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
HAROLD	Damn.
PAUL	Mom?

PAUL	Play?
HAROLD	Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.

PAUL	A hundred dollars!
HAROLD	The smallest thing I've got.
PAUL	Can I get dressed first?
HAROLD	Make it fast.

PAUL	Dad--
HAROLD	Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
PAUL	A hundred dollars for breakfast?
HAROLD	Leave a tip.

PAUL	What kind of exercise?
HAROLD	Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.

PAUL	I'm a man.
HAROLD	We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
PAUL	No.
HAROLD	You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.

PAUL	Dad?
HAROLD	Who was it?
PAUL	It's Mom.

PAUL	Mom?
HAROLD	What's this?

HAROLD	What's this?
PAUL	Nothing.
HAROLD	That's a rifle you have?
PAUL	No.
HAROLD	Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
PAUL	No.
HAROLD	Open the bolt!

HAROLD	That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
HAROLD	Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
PAUL	Gee whiz, Dad--
HAROLD	Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
PAUL	Dad--
HAROLD	Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`

HAROLD	Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
PAUL	I don't want to fight you.
HAROLD	Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
PAUL	It's your house, Dad.
HAROLD	Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.

PAUL	I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
HAROLD	I'm talking to you gently now.
PAUL	Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.

PENELOPE	How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
HAROLD	I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.

HAROLD	Hamburger Heaven.
PENELOPE	Heaven.

PENELOPE	Can I help you, sir?
HAROLD	I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
PENELOPE	Eighteen--  and a half.
HAROLD	A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
PENELOPE	Sir?
HAROLD	Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
PENELOPE	Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
HAROLD	What time do you get off work, my child?
PENELOPE	I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
HAROLD	Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
PENELOPE	I'm engaged.
HAROLD	Daughter--I love you very much.
PENELOPE	You don't even know me.
HAROLD	You are woman.  I know woman well.
PENELOPE	This is crazy.
HAROLD	Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
PENELOPE	What do you do for a living?
HAROLD	My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
PENELOPE	Some kind of animal?
HAROLD	The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.

PENELOPE	How do you do?
HAROLD	How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
PENELOPE	Not at all.
HAROLD	I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.

HAROLD	What's the matter?
PENELOPE	Give us time.
HAROLD	Like hugging a lamp post.
PENELOPE	Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
HAROLD	You were well adjusted to my being dead?
PENELOPE	We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
HAROLD	What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
PENELOPE	I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
HAROLD	Disease?
PENELOPE	Situation.
HAROLD	This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
PENELOPE	A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
HAROLD	Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
PENELOPE	Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
HAROLD	You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
PENELOPE	Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.

HAROLD	Bluh.
PENELOPE	You'd better get Dr. Woodly.

HAROLD	What's that all about?
PENELOPE	We thought a doctor might help.
HAROLD	Your old beau?
PENELOPE	We thought it was an emergency.
HAROLD	I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
PENELOPE	He's a very decent man, Harold.
HAROLD	We all are.
PENELOPE	Shouldn't you lie down?
HAROLD	When I'm dead--  or fucking.
PENELOPE	Paul said you were awfully sick.
HAROLD	I was, I was.  It never lasts long.

PENELOPE	You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
HAROLD	Nothing would please me more.
PENELOPE	Thank God!

PENELOPE	I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
HAROLD	Have some.

PENELOPE	Harold!
HAROLD	I could carve a better man out of a banana!
PENELOPE	Please--
HAROLD	You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--

PENELOPE	He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
HAROLD	He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.

PENELOPE	Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
HAROLD	Say hello to your mother.
PENELOPE	Do say hello to your mother.

HAROLD	Now that's what I call fun.
PENELOPE	Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
HAROLD	You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
PENELOPE	I did?
HAROLD	We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
PENELOPE	A trip, you mean?
HAROLD	I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.

PENELOPE	He hasn't had breakfast yet.
HAROLD	Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.

HAROLD	Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
PENELOPE	It's so--so stark.
HAROLD	You used to like it stark!
PENELOPE	Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
HAROLD	I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!

HAROLD	Now--turn around, if you would.
PENELOPE	Turn around?
HAROLD	I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.

HAROLD	I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
PENELOPE	You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
HAROLD	You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
PENELOPE	I have a brain.
HAROLD	We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.

PENELOPE	I have some change!
HAROLD	Ram it up your ass!

PENELOPE	Breakfast?
HAROLD	Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?

HAROLD	And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
PENELOPE	Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
HAROLD	All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
PENELOPE	That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
HAROLD	Which one?
PENELOPE	Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.
HAROLD	She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
PENELOPE	What a honeymoon.
HAROLD	Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
PENELOPE	You're wrong.
HAROLD	Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!

HAROLD	Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
PENELOPE	We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
HAROLD	You're a woman, aren't you?

HAROLD	Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
PENELOPE	People don't use that word any more.
HAROLD	Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
PENELOPE	You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
HAROLD	People now have dignity when frying eggs?
PENELOPE	They don't have to feel like slaves.
HAROLD	Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.

HAROLD	I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
PENELOPE	I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
HAROLD	I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?

HAROLD	Let me guess--breakfast is served?
PENELOPE	No.
HAROLD	What then?
PENELOPE	I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
HAROLD	That's what you're supposed to say.
PENELOPE	This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
HAROLD	You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
PENELOPE	I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
HAROLD	It couldn't!
PENELOPE	I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
HAROLD	Fish can't feel.
PENELOPE	Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
HAROLD	Such as?...
PENELOPE	The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
HAROLD	Tell me about its sexual roots.
PENELOPE	It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
HAROLD	I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
PENELOPE	Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
HAROLD	Go on.
PENELOPE	And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
HAROLD	You learned this in some college course?
PENELOPE	I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
HAROLD	The doctor.
PENELOPE	Yes.
HAROLD	And what is his most cherished possession?
PENELOPE	His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
HAROLD	And he keeps it in his apartment?
PENELOPE	Yes.
HAROLD	And no one's there now?
PENELOPE	I don't think so.
HAROLD	That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
PENELOPE	What are you going to do?
HAROLD	He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
PENELOPE	No you're not!
HAROLD	Why not?
PENELOPE	Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.

PENELOPE	I came for my clothes.
HAROLD	Sneaking in the back door.
PENELOPE	I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
HAROLD	Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
PENELOPE	I came for Paul as well.
HAROLD	If he wants to go.
PENELOPE	You took him to the funeral, I hear.
HAROLD	He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
PENELOPE	A dozen?
HAROLD	It's a big and busy funeral home.
PENELOPE	Did you like it, dear?
HAROLD	It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
PENELOPE	Unless she has nerve.
HAROLD	More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
PENELOPE	He knows you shattered his violin.
HAROLD	I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
PENELOPE	He cried.
HAROLD	About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
PENELOPE	Two hundred years old.
HAROLD	He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
PENELOPE	He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
HAROLD	Hope.

HAROLD	Things.
PENELOPE	You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?

HAROLD	Well--what have we here?  A family.
PENELOPE	Almost a Christmas scene.
HAROLD	Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
PENELOPE	Just one favor.
HAROLD	Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
PENELOPE	I want you to tell me that you loved me once.

HAROLD	Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
PENELOPE	I see.

HAROLD	See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
PENELOPE	How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
HAROLD	He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
PENELOPE	Rifle?
HAROLD	I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
PENELOPE	He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
HAROLD	Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
PENELOPE	He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
HAROLD	And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
PENELOPE	It seems highly intelligent to me.
HAROLD	What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
PENELOPE	Blue soup?
HAROLD	An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
PENELOPE	Sounds quite beautiful.
HAROLD	Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
PENELOPE	Like what?
HAROLD	Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!

PENELOPE	He's a child!
HAROLD	With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
PENELOPE	You're begging him to kill you?
HAROLD	If he thinks he's man enough.
PENELOPE	That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
HAROLD	I'm teaching my son to be a man.
PENELOPE	So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
HAROLD	I plan to live one hundred years!
PENELOPE	No you don't.
HAROLD	If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
PENELOPE	Honor, I suppose.
HAROLD	What a handsome word.
PENELOPE	But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
HAROLD	If you've lived a good life, fought well--
PENELOPE	It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
HAROLD	May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!

PENELOPE	The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
HAROLD	I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
PENELOPE	No.
HAROLD	No.

HAROLD	And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
PENELOPE	I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
HAROLD	You hope this, too?

PENELOPE	I'm going to call the police.
HAROLD	Don't!

PENELOPE	This is suicide.  Go get the police.
HAROLD	Stop!

PENELOPE	No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
HAROLD	There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.

PENELOPE	I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
HAROLD	Ah!  The lady is armed.
PENELOPE	I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
HAROLD	Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
PENELOPE	I mean it!
HAROLD	Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
PENELOPE	Where's the bullet?

HAROLD	Help your mother find the bullet.
PENELOPE	There it is.  Give it to me.

PENELOPE	How do I load?
HAROLD	Load it for her.

PENELOPE	All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
HAROLD	The National Safety Council would be appalled.
PENELOPE	Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.

HAROLD	She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
PENELOPE	Out!

HAROLD	Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
PENELOPE	You've killed women?
HAROLD	Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!

PENELOPE	Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
HAROLD	Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
PENELOPE	Do it, Norbert.

WOODLY	Ooops.
HAROLD	Ooops.
WOODLY	Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
HAROLD	Gentlemen--that's nice.
WOODLY	You startled me.

HAROLD	The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
WOODLY	It's always locked.
HAROLD	But here you are inside, aren't you?
WOODLY	You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
HAROLD	We tried to be.  We tried to be.
WOODLY	He's dead, you know.
HAROLD	Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?

WOODLY	Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
HAROLD	Hello, Mother.
WOODLY	...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
HAROLD	Oh dear.
WOODLY	Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now.

WOODLY	Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
HAROLD	We'll miss you so.
WOODLY	Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
HAROLD	Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
WOODLY	I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.

WOODLY	I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
HAROLD	Ahh--then she's still alive.
WOODLY	She's fine.  Please--
HAROLD	And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
WOODLY	Will you please go?  An emergency!
HAROLD	She still has just the one child-- the boy?

WOODLY	Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
HAROLD	And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
WOODLY	Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
HAROLD	And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
WOODLY	Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!

HAROLD	Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
WOODLY	And her fiancé!
HAROLD	And her fiancé!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
WOODLY	I've got to run!

HAROLD	You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
WOODLY	I've literally got to run!
HAROLD	I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.

WOODLY	Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
HAROLD	I came back.

HAROLD	How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
WOODLY	A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
HAROLD	Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
WOODLY	Are--are you crying, Penelope?
HAROLD	She's crying because she's so happy.

WOODLY	I feel the same way.  What next?
HAROLD	What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
WOODLY	None.
HAROLD	Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
WOODLY	Good night.

WOODLY	Ah!  You're ambulatory!
HAROLD	What a brilliant diagnosis!

WOODLY	Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
HAROLD	I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
WOODLY	You've been bitten by bats?
HAROLD	Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
WOODLY	You have chills?
HAROLD	Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."

HAROLD	You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
WOODLY	I was going to ask.
HAROLD	Pacqualinincheewa root.
WOODLY	Would you say that again?
HAROLD	Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
WOODLY	I've never heard of it.
HAROLD	Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
WOODLY	Are you've seen it work cures?
HAROLD	Hundreds.

HAROLD	Wasn't that sweet of me?
WOODLY	More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
HAROLD	We have, have we?
WOODLY	That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
HAROLD	Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.

WOODLY	Good Lord.
HAROLD	I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."

WOODLY	I thought she was a widow.
HAROLD	You were wrong, you quack!

WOODLY	I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
HAROLD	What for?
WOODLY	Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.

HAROLD	It died for your sins.
WOODLY	This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
HAROLD	There's a certain amount of information there.
WOODLY	Lest we forget how cruel you are.

HAROLD	This is man to man.
WOODLY	It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
HAROLD	What brought you back?
WOODLY	The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
HAROLD	He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.

HAROLD	There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
WOODLY	Yes.
HAROLD	I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
WOODLY	Correct.
HAROLD	What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
WOODLY	You haven't heard me yet.
HAROLD	You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
WOODLY	We'll find out now, won't we?

WOODLY	You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
HAROLD	Oooooo.  That hurt.
WOODLY	You're old--so old.
HAROLD	Now who's being cruel?
WOODLY	A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
HAROLD	We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.

WOODLY	You're a son of a bitch.
HAROLD	Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.

WOODLY	I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
HAROLD	Comical?

WOODLY	Hands and knees, you say?
HAROLD	And terror, if you don't mind.

HAROLD	You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
WOODLY	I'm high as a kite.
HAROLD	Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
WOODLY	You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
HAROLD	I love you!  Have a cigar!
WOODLY	Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
HAROLD	I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
WOODLY	If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
HAROLD	This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
WOODLY	You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
HAROLD	I'm an honorable clown?
WOODLY	King Arthur.
HAROLD	You hope.
WOODLY	In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
HAROLD	No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
WOODLY	Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
HAROLD	Cut me open.  Find out.
WOODLY	I've struck my blow.
HAROLD	With spittle?
WOODLY	I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
WOODLY	I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
HAROLD	Poison.
WOODLY	You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
HAROLD	I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
WOODLY	You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
HAROLD	No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
HAROLD	I see.
WOODLY	You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
HAROLD	Don Quixote.
WOODLY	My violin is avenged!
HAROLD	Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
WOODLY	And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
HAROLD	The new hero is you.
WOODLY	I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
HAROLD	You're too modest.
WOODLY	But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
HAROLD	Was I ever of use?
WOODLY	Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.

HAROLD	Here.  Finish the job.
WOODLY	I'm utterly satisfied.
HAROLD	You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
WOODLY	More clowning!  Don't you see?
HAROLD	We never quit fighting until we're dead.
WOODLY	You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
HAROLD	I'm going to shoot you now.
WOODLY	No!
HAROLD	My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
WOODLY	New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
HAROLD	Like the saber-toothed tiger.
WOODLY	Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
WOODLY	Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
HAROLD	If you want to be found that way.
WOODLY	What is this thing that kills me?
HAROLD	Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
WOODLY	Don't shoot.
HAROLD	I've enjoyed being man.

WOODLY	No.  No.
HAROLD	Get up.
WOODLY	No.
HAROLD	Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.

HAROLD	Can't do it.
WOODLY	Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.

WOODLY	Thank you--for my life.
HAROLD	It's trash now, like mine.
WOODLY	New lives begin!
HAROLD	Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
WOODLY	What are you going to do?
HAROLD	Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
WOODLY	Leave the rifle here.
HAROLD	I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
WOODLY	Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
HAROLD	For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.

LOOSELEAF	Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
PENELOPE	Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
LOOSELEAF	I dunno, boy.
PENELOPE	You don't know?
LOOSELEAF	It was a bitch.
PENELOPE	Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.

PENELOPE	And you went home unannounced, too?
LOOSELEAF	I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.

PENELOPE	Alice got married again.
LOOSELEAF	She did?
PENELOPE	You didn't even find that out?
LOOSELEAF	There was so much going on.
PENELOPE	She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
LOOSELEAF	So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.

PENELOPE	Dead!
LOOSELEAF	Jesus.
PENELOPE	Alice is dead?
LOOSELEAF	No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
PENELOPE	For what?
LOOSELEAF	For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
PENELOPE	Who's dead?
LOOSELEAF	My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
PENELOPE	What happened?
LOOSELEAF	Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
PENELOPE	How horrible.
LOOSELEAF	Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?

PENELOPE	And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
LOOSELEAF	I dunno.

LOOSELEAF	So long, you guys.
PENELOPE	What will you do, Colonel?
LOOSELEAF	I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.

WANDA JUNE	Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
MILDRED	Thought you were another wife, maybe.
WANDA JUNE	I'm only ten years old.
MILDRED	That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
WANDA JUNE	Won't you please join our club? Please?
MILDRED	Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.

VON KONIGSWALD	Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
MILDRED	I heard you were looking for me.
VON KONIGSWALD	You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
MILDRED	Yes.
VON KONIGSWALD	You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
MILDRED	Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?

VON KONIGSWALD	Because he was cruel?
MILDRED	Premature ejaculation.
VON KONIGSWALD	Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
VON KONIGSWALD	That is sad.
MILDRED	Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
VON KONIGSWALD	Ja?
MILDRED	Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.

SHUTTLE	She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
PAUL	I don't care what she wears.
SHUTTLE	Something's made you sore.
PAUL	Don't worry about it.
SHUTTLE	You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
PAUL	It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
SHUTTLE	I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
PAUL	She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
SHUTTLE	Kid--kid--
PAUL	And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
SHUTTLE	What's this?
PAUL	Don't!
SHUTTLE	You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
PAUL	Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.

PAUL	Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
SHUTTLE	Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?

SHUTTLE	I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
PAUL	Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.

PAUL	Thank God!
SHUTTLE	What a relief!

SHUTTLE	That goes double for me.
PAUL	I don't want to live any more.
SHUTTLE	I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
PAUL	I'll kill myself.
SHUTTLE	The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.

PAUL	Don't touch me.
SHUTTLE	Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
PAUL	No.
SHUTTLE	All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.

PENELOPE	And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
PAUL	He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
PENELOPE	I told you this was a simple-minded play.
PAUL	Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
PENELOPE	I know.
PAUL	Stay home tonight!
PENELOPE	Oh, Paul--
PAUL	You're married!  You've already got a husband!
PENELOPE	He's a ghost!
PAUL	He's alive!
PENELOPE	Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
PAUL	If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
PENELOPE	Thank you, kind sir.
PAUL	A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
PENELOPE	A what kind of doctor?
PAUL	A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
PENELOPE	That's an interesting piece of news.
PAUL	You're the only woman he ever took out.
PENELOPE	Not true.
PAUL	Still lives with his mother.
PENELOPE	You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
PAUL	How did she lose her feet?
PENELOPE	In a railroad accident many years ago.
PAUL	I was afraid to ask.
PENELOPE	Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
PAUL	I didn't know that.
PENELOPE	A lot of people don't.
PAUL	J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
PENELOPE	I don't really know.
PAUL	To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.

PENELOPE	I hate that thing.
PAUL	It's beautiful.

PENELOPE	Where will you be?
PAUL	Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.

PAUL	Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
PENELOPE	Who have you been talking to?
PAUL	What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?

PENELOPE	Yes, he is.
PAUL	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

PENELOPE	Is Norbert still here?
PAUL	No.
PENELOPE	Then who flushed the toilet?
PAUL	Father's friend.
PENELOPE	What's his name?
PAUL	Don't know.
PENELOPE	For Heaven's sakes!

PAUL	Mom?
PENELOPE	That man is your father.
PAUL	What?
PENELOPE	There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
PAUL	I don't get it.
PENELOPE	It is you, isn't it, Harold?

PENELOPE	That's why I'm crying.
PAUL	Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?

PENELOPE	What are his symptoms?
PAUL	Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
PENELOPE	What does he say to do?
PAUL	He can hardly talk.

PAUL	Really?
PENELOPE	It is an emergency, isn't it?
PAUL	Yeah.
PENELOPE	Then get him.
PAUL	Okay.

WOODLY	Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
PAUL	You're taking Mom out tonight?
WOODLY	You're going out?

PAUL	We don't have a maid any more.
WOODLY	Oh?

PAUL	Everything stays as it is!
WOODLY	A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
PAUL	My father!
WOODLY	I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
PAUL	Don't worry about it.
WOODLY	How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
PAUL	It's fine!
WOODLY	It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.

WOODLY	I hate that thing.
PAUL	Keeps fairies away!

PAUL	It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
WOODLY	Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.

WOODLY	I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
PAUL	He isn't any friend of Father.
WOODLY	He isn't?
PAUL	He is my father.
WOODLY	No!

PENELOPE	Please--
SHUTTLE	He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
PENELOPE	I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?

SHUTTLE	I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
PENELOPE	Doing what?
SHUTTLE	He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
PENELOPE	Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
SHUTTLE	He'd assume we had.
PENELOPE	That's something I suppose.
SHUTTLE	All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
PENELOPE	I'm glad.
SHUTTLE	I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
PENELOPE	I know.
SHUTTLE	If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
PENELOPE	I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
SHUTTLE	You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"

PENELOPE	Yes?
SHUTTLE	Something happens to my confidence.
PENELOPE	This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
SHUTTLE	When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
PENELOPE	I'm touched.
SHUTTLE	That's when I'll get my confidence back.
PENELOPE	I see.
SHUTTLE	If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
PENELOPE	Good night.

PENELOPE	Coming.
SHUTTLE	Women are always late.  You'll find out.

PENELOPE	Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
SHUTTLE	Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
PENELOPE	Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?

PENELOPE	What then?
SHUTTLE	We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.

PENELOPE	Did you see him?
SHUTTLE	Yeah.
PENELOPE	Is he all right?
SHUTTLE	Far as I know.
PENELOPE	Is he coming home?
SHUTTLE	He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
PENELOPE	The park!
SHUTTLE	It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
SHUTTLE	I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
PENELOPE	You figure!
SHUTTLE	Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
PENELOPE	A what?
SHUTTLE	For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
PENELOPE	How nice.
SHUTTLE	They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."

PENELOPE	Did you talk to Paul?
SHUTTLE	Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
PENELOPE	We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
SHUTTLE	He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
PENELOPE	What was it?
SHUTTLE	He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.

PENELOPE	What's the matter now?
SHUTTLE	We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?

PENELOPE	Possibly.
SHUTTLE	How long has this been going on?
PENELOPE	A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
SHUTTLE	I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
PENELOPE	I'm sorry.
SHUTTLE	Marry me instead.
PENELOPE	Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
SHUTTLE	You're saying no.
PENELOPE	I'm saying no--and thank you.
SHUTTLE	I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
PENELOPE	You were wonderful.
SHUTTLE	What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.

PENELOPE	It's true.
SHUTTLE	Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.

PENELOPE	You and Harold are friends?
SHUTTLE	He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.

WOODLY	I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
PENELOPE	Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?

PENELOPE	Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
WOODLY	Take plenty of cigars.
PENELOPE	We made the date three months ago.
WOODLY	I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
PENELOPE	She quit this afternoon.

PENELOPE	The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
WOODLY	I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
PENELOPE	They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
WOODLY	Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.

PENELOPE	War is not healthy for children and other living things. How lovely.
WOODLY	No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.

WOODLY	Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
PENELOPE	What?
WOODLY	Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.

PENELOPE	I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
WOODLY	Tonight's the night.

WOODLY	This is very good for us.
PENELOPE	It is?
WOODLY	The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
PENELOPE	As long as he keeps out of the park.
WOODLY	After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
PENELOPE	The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
WOODLY	We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
PENELOPE	That's the XKE.
WOODLY	The what?
PENELOPE	It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
WOODLY	What kind of a life is that?
PENELOPE	He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
WOODLY	If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
PENELOPE	No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
WOODLY	I wish Paul luck.
PENELOPE	It's suicide!
WOODLY	I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
PENELOPE	Meaning?
WOODLY	Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
PENELOPE	Why would you do that?
WOODLY	To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
PENELOPE	I'm amazed.
WOODLY	Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
PENELOPE	And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
WOODLY	They didn't murder me.
PENELOPE	Paul's only twelve years old.
WOODLY	He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
PENELOPE	We've got to rescue him.
WOODLY	If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
PENELOPE	He's not your son.
WOODLY	No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
PENELOPE	It's a jungle out there.
WOODLY	That's been said before.
PENELOPE	He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.

PENELOPE	You know each other?
WOODLY	We met here earlier this evening.
PENELOPE	How neat.  How keen.

WOODLY	Thank you.  Thank you very much.
PENELOPE	I believe in miracles now.

WOODLY	I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
PENELOPE	Tell her to have a nice trip.
WOODLY	Thanks.

PENELOPE	Get out of here.
WOODLY	It's really that bad?

PENELOPE	You fool, you fool.
WOODLY	Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?

WOODLY	Everything's going to be beautiful.
PENELOPE	You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!

PENELOPE	Do it!
WOODLY	Goodbye.

SHUTTLE	Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
WOODLY	I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
SHUTTLE	Is that a fact?
WOODLY	That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.

SHUTTLE	You've got to fight from time to time.
WOODLY	Not true.
SHUTTLE	Or get eaten alive.
WOODLY	That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
SHUTTLE	Phooey.
WOODLY	Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.

WOODLY	We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
SHUTTLE	Penelope!  We're late!

WOODLY	The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
SHUTTLE	I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
WOODLY	It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
SHUTTLE	None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
WOODLY	Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
SHUTTLE	You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?

SHUTTLE	Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
WOODLY	Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
SHUTTLE	You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
WOODLY	He died of a massive rupture.
SHUTTLE	You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
WOODLY	You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!

SHUTTLE	Kid--kid--
WOODLY	It's good.  Let him go.
SHUTTLE	If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
WOODLY	Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.

SHUTTLE	If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
WOODLY	What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
SHUTTLE	I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--

WOODLY	Minors aren't allowed at fights.
SHUTTLE	Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.

WOODLY	Happy Birthday, Wanda June!
SHUTTLE	We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.

WANDA JUNE	We have this new club up here in Heaven.
VON KONIGSWALD	Yes, we do.
WANDA JUNE	We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
VON KONIGSWALD	We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
WANDA JUNE	Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
VON KONIGSWALD	Mozart plays shuffleboard.
WANDA JUNE	Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
VON KONIGSWALD	Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
WANDA JUNE	Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
VON KONIGSWALD	It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
WANDA JUNE	We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
VON KONIGSWALD	You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--

NICKY	ADRIAN!
ADRIAN	You shouldn't have come here.
NICKY	Please, get out of my mind!

NICKY	Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
ADRIAN	He's sick?
NICKY	Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.

ADRIAN	He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
NICKY	Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
ADRIAN	How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.

ADRIAN	Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
NICKY	Let her go.
ADRIAN	I hear a train coming. Drink.

ADRIAN	Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
NICKY	Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?

ADRIAN	Little Nicky.
NICKY	Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
ADRIAN	Is this a joke?
NICKY	No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.

NICKY	Now will you get in the flask?
ADRIAN	Absolutely not.

CASSIUS	I knew it. He's finally retiring.
ADRIAN	I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.

CASSIUS	You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
ADRIAN	And he's dead serious.
CASSIUS	It's just such a slap in the face.

ADRIAN	Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
CASSIUS	Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!

CASSIUS	That's what I thought!
ADRIAN	Could you concentrate for five seconds?
CASSIUS	I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
ADRIAN	What do you think about... Earth?

ADRIAN	We could create our own hell there.
CASSIUS	You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
ADRIAN	Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
CASSIUS	...their damned souls will be ours.
ADRIAN	It's our time, brother.

CASSIUS	Let the sin begins -- that was a good one.
ADRIAN	Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
CASSIUS	I lowered the drinking age to ten.
ADRIAN	Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
CASSIUS	Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?

ADRIAN	Hello, Cassius.
CASSIUS	All right. Let me out.
ADRIAN	You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
CASSIUS	You mother...

CASSIUS	Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
ADRIAN	I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.

ADRIAN	No!
CASSIUS	Don't do it!

ADRIAN	Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
JOHN	Noon...

JOHN	But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
ADRIAN	Sure, why not?

ADRIAN	It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
JOHN	Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.

JOHN	And give you a good buzz.
ADRIAN	Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
JOHN	Uh. No it won't?

ADRIAN	Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
JOHN	Urr... uggg... errr...
ADRIAN	I'm calling you out, brother...

ADRIAN	Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
JOHN	You want a queen? Got one right here.

ANGEL	Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
CHRISTA	So excited.

CHRISTA	I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
ANGEL	Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.

ANGEL	I'll call her later.
CHRISTA	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.

ANGEL	All these good people have totally been led astray.
CHRISTA	Show him Central Park.

CHRISTA	She goes to Parson's, right?
ANGEL	I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.

NICKY	The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
ANGEL	Maybe try the opposite of that.

ANGEL	Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
NICKY	My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
ANGEL	A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
NICKY	My mom wasn't a goat?
ANGEL	Try an angel.
NICKY	An angel?
ANGEL	Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.

NICKY	Wow. What... what did she look like?
ANGEL	Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.

NICKY	How come you're not older?
ANGEL	Angels don't get any older, son.

NICKY	Where did you meet my father?
ANGEL	It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.

ANGEL	Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
NICKY	Well tell her I said "hi" back.

NICKY	How did you see me?
ANGEL	We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.

NICKY	Valerie's crying!
ANGEL	She's so nice.

NICKY	I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
ANGEL	Yeah, you do...

NICKY	But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
ANGEL	Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
NICKY	A speech impediment?

NICKY	What is it?
ANGEL	I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.

NICKY	Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
ANGEL	It would be so okay.

NICKY	Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
ANGEL	You're already there...

TODD	What's Nicky doing down there?
BEEFY	Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.

TODD	Did you just talk?
BEEFY	No.

TODD	Where is he? He's late.
BEEFY	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.

TODD	They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
BEEFY	I can't screw.  I can't screw.

TODD	Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
BEEFY	That turn you on there, RuPaul?

BEEFY	My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
NICKY	I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
BEEFY	It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.

NICKY	Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
BEEFY	It's not me, moron.
NICKY	Oh. Sorry.

BEEFY	Makin' friends already.
NICKY	It's freezing up here, Beefy.
BEEFY	You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
NICKY	I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
BEEFY	That pain is hunger.

NICKY	So far, so good. Now what?
BEEFY	Put it in your mouth.

NICKY	Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
BEEFY	It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
NICKY	I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!

NICKY	From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
BEEFY	Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.

BEEFY	You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
NICKY	Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?

NICKY	This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
BEEFY	Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
NICKY	Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
BEEFY	Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
NICKY	Well, let's rock and roll.

NICKY	All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
BEEFY	I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.

BEEFY	Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
NICKY	What can I do about it?
BEEFY	You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
NICKY	Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
BEEFY	Go get a soda out of the fridge.
NICKY	But those are my roommate's sodas...
BEEFY	But those are my roommate's sodas... Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?

BEEFY	You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
NICKY	Release the evil?
BEEFY	I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.

NICKY	We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
BEEFY	Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.

NICKY	I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
BEEFY	The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.

NICKY	I didn't murder anybody
BEEFY	Look. You were really high. Things happen.
NICKY	I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
BEEFY	I think you're looking at him.

NICKY	This is baloney!
BEEFY	He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."

LUCIFER	What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
DAD	Everything's fine, pop.
LUCIFER	Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
DAD	Please, pop, just go back to your room.
LUCIFER	Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
DAD	Sure, pop. Whatever you want.

DAD	I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
DAN	C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
DAD	In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
DAN	You did it for Namath.
DAD	Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
DAN	This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
DAD	Now you're talking.

JIMMY THE DEMON	Knock, knock.
DAD	Yes, Jimmy.

DAD	No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
JIMMY THE DEMON	Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.

DAD	I got no ears! I can't hear!
JIMMY THE DEMON	Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!

JIMMY THE DEMON	Check one-two. Check one-two.
DAD	Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
JIMMY THE DEMON	He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!

NICKY	Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
DAD	Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?

DAD	Now everybody sit down.
NICKY	Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
DAD	Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.

DAD	This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
NICKY	Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
DAD	Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.

NICKY	I mean... tough break.
DAD	The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.

DAD	Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
NICKY	Definitely.
DAD	I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
NICKY	Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.

DAD	Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
NICKY	Metallica, Dad. Come on.
DAD	I was just playing with you.

NICKY	You're a good devil, Dad.
DAD	And I also happen to be a Jets fan.

DAD	This is bad, Nicky.
NICKY	How bad?
DAD	I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.

DAD	To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
NICKY	So go get 'em, Dad!
DAD	I'm too weak. The process has already begun.

DAD	Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
NICKY	Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?

NICKY	No. This can't be happening.
DAD	Son, just do your best.

DAD	That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
NICKY	Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
DAD	Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.

NICKY	Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
DAD	What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...

NICKY	Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
DAD	I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!

DAD	You came through, Nicky.
NICKY	I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
DAD	You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
NICKY	What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
DAD	Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.

DAD	Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
NICKY	I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...

GATEKEEPER	I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
NICKY	Coulda been much worse.
GATEKEEPER	That's what I'm thinkin'...

GATEKEEPER	Hey.
NICKY	That's a pretty brassiere.
GATEKEEPER	Thanks.
NICKY	Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
GATEKEEPER	You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
NICKY	You got it.

GATEKEEPER	Bus?
NICKY	Beast.

LUCIFER	You know, I was the one who created Hell.
GATEKEEPER	I know, your wickedness.
LUCIFER	I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.

LUCIFER	You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
GATEKEEPER	It's Stanley, sir.
LUCIFER	Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
GATEKEEPER	What was it called, sir.
LUCIFER	Boogerland!
GATEKEEPER	That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
LUCIFER	I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...

NICKY	Hey...
JIMMY THE DEMON	Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
NICKY	Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!

JIMMY THE DEMON	Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
NICKY	We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?

NICKY	So go get 'em, Jimmy!
JIMMY THE DEMON	I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
NICKY	You're not saying it's up to me?

NICKY	I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
JIMMY THE DEMON	You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.

JIMMY THE DEMON	You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
NICKY	I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.

JOHN	No wonder your uncle's so weird...
TODD	I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.

TODD	I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
JOHN	By she, do you mean he?
TODD	No.

JOHN	Easy, Liberace.
TODD	Oh, would you grow up.

TODD	His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
JOHN	Of course you do, Tommy Tune.

PETER	Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
JOHN	'Bout time...

JOHN	There's our man.
PETER	Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.

JOHN	What's with that guy?
PETER	Gotta be one of his disciples or something.

JOHN	Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
PETER	Should we wake him up?
JOHN	Yeah. You do it.

PETER	Did you check out the dragon mouth?
JOHN	The Dark Prince is here.

PETER	Look who's back from the dead.
JOHN	Six, six, six, pick up sticks.

JOHN	That's a big pass, Elton John.
PETER	We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?

PETER	You sure you're down with this?
JOHN	Little nervous. Wanna puke.

JOHN	Looking for the chief.
PETER	We know where to find Nicky.

JOHN	Schnapps...
PETER	Peppermint... alright.

PETER	This don't look good.
JOHN	Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?

NICKY	Which way did he go?
JOHN	That way.

JOHN	What's Ozzy trying to say there?
NICKY	Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.

JOHN	Come on. One more time.
NICKY	Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.

NICKY	No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
JOHN	Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
NICKY	See ya, fellas.

REGIS	So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
KATHY LEE	Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
REGIS	So I followed him...
KATHY LEE	You followed him?
REGIS	I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
KATHY LEE	You keep a bat under your seat?
REGIS	Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
KATHY LEE	Yes, great movie...
REGIS	I was DeNiro!

PETER	Please. You got to.
NICKY	All right...

NICKY	I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
PETER	Dude, it's us. Let us in.

NICKY	Good idea... kill me.
PETER	Dude. Seriously?
NICKY	Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.

PETER	You gotta kill yourself.
NICKY	I'll just go to Heaven.

STUDENT	Hello.
NICKY	You smell like coconuts.
STUDENT	It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
NICKY	No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
STUDENT	Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
NICKY	Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
STUDENT	I don't need luck. I'm good.

NICKY	Adrian?
STUDENT	Andrew.

STUDENT	You got the wrong window again, man.
NICKY	Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?

NICKY	That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
VALERIE	That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
NICKY	You think I'm a tourist?
VALERIE	I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
NICKY	The South.
VALERIE	Really?
NICKY	Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
VALERIE	Why are you laughing?
NICKY	I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
VALERIE	My dad's an optometrist.
NICKY	My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
VALERIE	I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
NICKY	If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
VALERIE	Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.

NICKY	Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
VALERIE	That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
NICKY	Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
VALERIE	If you want to.
NICKY	Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
VALERIE	Octopus people?
NICKY	Uh, it's a deep south expression.

NICKY	It's freezing my hands.
VALERIE	It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.

VALERIE	This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
NICKY	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
VALERIE	You have a dog? What kind?
NICKY	I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.

VALERIE	I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
NICKY	School?
VALERIE	Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
NICKY	What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
VALERIE	My perfume?

NICKY	Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
VALERIE	Sometimes, sure.
NICKY	Good. I was concerned.

NICKY	So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
VALERIE	Basically, yeah.
NICKY	Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.

VALERIE	You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
NICKY	Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
VALERIE	What?

NICKY	Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
VALERIE	What was that?
NICKY	I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...

NICKY	Hey.
VALERIE	Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.

VALERIE	What were you thinking coming here?
NICKY	I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.

NICKY	Valerie?
VALERIE	Are you dead?
NICKY	No.
VALERIE	What are you doing?
NICKY	I think I'm floating.
VALERIE	Why would you be floating?
NICKY	I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
VALERIE	Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.

VALERIE	Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
NICKY	That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
VALERIE	What do you mean, "possessed?"
NICKY	Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
VALERIE	Yes...
NICKY	Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
VALERIE	..."The Devil?"...
NICKY	...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.

NICKY	You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
VALERIE	Okay, I do. Get back up here.

VALERIE	Can we go fly over Central Park?
NICKY	Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.

VALERIE	We're going to Jersey?
NICKY	East Rutherford.

NICKY	I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
VALERIE	Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head...

VALERIE	Don't do it.
NICKY	I have to, Valerie.

VALERIE	Nicky!
NICKY	That was Cassius!

VALERIE	Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
NICKY	From my dad's side of the family.

NICKY	Do me.
VALERIE	I love you.
NICKY	I love you.

NICKY	Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
TODD	Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?

NICKY	Yes. What is rent?
TODD	Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
NICKY	Off limits.
TODD	Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
NICKY	No.
TODD	It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
NICKY	Yeah. The deep South.

TODD	Why is that funny?
NICKY	I don't know.
TODD	And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.

NICKY	It looks like the work of a brother...
TODD	A black guy?
NICKY	If it's Cassius, yes.

NICKY	A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
TODD	Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?

NICKY	That just hurt a lot.
TODD	I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?

NICKY	Hey...
STREET VENDOR	See something you like, my man?
NICKY	Yes. I would like my flask back.

STREET VENDOR	You callin' me a thief, my man?
NICKY	No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
STREET VENDOR	And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
NICKY	I don't know?

STREET VENDOR	Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
NICKY	Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.

ROPER	Hello, guys.
BAFFERT	Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.

ROPER	They're not usually graduate students.
BAFFERT	SWAT wants to go in.
ROPER	What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?

BAFFERT	No -- you can't do that.
ROPER	You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
BAFFERT	I don't know.
ROPER	He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
BAFFERT	Not that we know of.
ROPER	We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
BAFFERT	Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.

BAFFERT	Floor seats.
ROPER	You're my hero.
BAFFERT	Dinner's on you.
ROPER	Deal.

BAFFERT	Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
ROPER	Phoney Frank? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
BAFFERT	I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
ROPER	Yeah, okay.

BAFFERT	This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
ROPER	You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
BAFFERT	Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
ROPER	It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
BAFFERT	No shit! He's good!
ROPER	Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
BAFFERT	Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.

BAFFERT	Where's the stereo?
ROPER	Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
BAFFERT	Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.

BAFFERT	Apartment 306.
ROPER	You want me to go up with you?
BAFFERT	Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
ROPER	Good. I don't want to be late.

BAFFERT	What's the line?
ROPER	It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
BAFFERT	I'll take half of your action.

KORDA	Who is it?
BAFFERT	It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.

KORDA	What happened? Is there a problem?
BAFFERT	May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.

KORDA	Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
BAFFERT	Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.

BAFFERT	Where did you find an old recording like that?
KORDA	Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
BAFFERT	I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
KORDA	You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?

BAFFERT	Could I please have a little water?
KORDA	Of course.

KORDA	Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
BAFFERT	This cousin of yours... What's his name?
KORDA	Clarence Teal.

KORDA	You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
CLARENCE	So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.

KORDA	You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
CLARENCE	I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
KORDA	Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
CLARENCE	What happened, Mike.
KORDA	You don't want to know.

KORDA	God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
CLARENCE	I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
KORDA	Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.

KORDA	You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
CLARENCE	Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
KORDA	Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...

CLARENCE	Don't make do it, Mike.
KORDA	Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
CLARENCE	I won't get away with it.
KORDA	Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.

MCCALL	I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
DAVE	You can't help me, man.

MCCALL	Who's controlling your mind?
DAVE	Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?

MCCALL	This has nothing to do with Walter.
DAVE	They want Walter dead!

MCCALL	Tell me what's wrong.
DAVE	Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
MCCALL	How can I help you with the particles?
DAVE	It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.

MCCALL	They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
DAVE	Huh?

DAVE	Tell my dad.
MCCALL	Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
DAVE	Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
MCCALL	I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.

DAVE	I hate fucking Springfield.
MCCALL	Is that where you're family lives?

EARL	Where's the car?
ROPER	I need to get something straight first.

ROPER	It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
EARL	Then where's my FUCKING car!

EARL	Really?
ROPER	Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.

ROPER	The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
EARL	Am I gettin' the car?
ROPER	You're gettin' the car.

EARL	What?!
ROPER	You want a convertible or hardtop?

ROPER	Manual or automatic?
EARL	Automatic.
ROPER	You got it.

JAIL GUARD #2	Who are you again?
KORDA	Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
JAIL GUARD #2	Johnny who?

JAIL GUARD #2	Hold on a second here.
KORDA	Is there a problem?

JAIL GUARD #2	You signed out twice.
KORDA	I what?
JAIL GUARD #2	Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
KORDA	Wait a minute, lemme see that.

KIMURA	Hi, Roper.
ROPER	Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?

KIMURA	The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
ROPER	...a car.
KIMURA	That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
ROPER	...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
KIMURA	That's right.
ROPER	What's the suspect's name?
KIMURA	Earl.

ROPER	We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
KIMURA	Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
ROPER	I have to go face to face.

ROPER	Anything on Korda so far?
KIMURA	Solis said to keep you clear of this.

ROPER	What do you got on Korda?
KIMURA	We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
ROPER	Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
KIMURA	Being faxed over now.
ROPER	How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
KIMURA	Roper...
ROPER	And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
KIMURA	Roper, we're into it...

KORDA	You don't have to come here.
ROPER	Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.

KORDA	Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
ROPER	Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.

KORDA	Are you in charge, Roper?
ROPER	Yep.
KORDA	I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.

KORDA	I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
ROPER	Is that all?
KORDA	For now that's all.
ROPER	You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
KORDA	No. You just do shit for me right now.

ROPER	Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
KORDA	I'll give you something.

KORDA	You can't kill me like this.
ROPER	What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?

KORDA	Open your shirt.
ROPER	I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
KORDA	Shut the fuck up and do what I say!

ROPER	Satisfied?
KORDA	Open the bag, dump everything on the table.

ROPER	It's all there.
KORDA	Spread it out.

KORDA	I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
ROPER	Yeah.
KORDA	That's not going to look too good on your service record.
ROPER	I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.

MCCALL	Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
ROPER	You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
MCCALL	I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.

ROPER	Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
MCCALL	Sorry... Habit.

ROPER	We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
MCCALL	If you say so.

ROPER	You ever been in a hostage situation?
MCCALL	Only at the very end.
ROPER	How do you feel after a shooting.
MCCALL	Like it had to be done.

ROPER	It rarely has to be done.
MCCALL	I've rarely shot anyone.
ROPER	SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
MCCALL	I know.
ROPER	Try to remember that.

MCCALL	What's the point of this?
ROPER	A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.

MCCALL	I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
ROPER	I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.

ROPER	So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
MCCALL	They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
ROPER	Recruited you from where?
MCCALL	National Marksman Competition.
ROPER	With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
MCCALL	Furthest point I could find from New York.
ROPER	You don't like New York?
MCCALL	Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
ROPER	You'd never been out of New York?
MCCALL	Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
ROPER	How did you like Toronto?
MCCALL	It was okay.
ROPER	You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
MCCALL	You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
ROPER	I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
MCCALL	Is there something wrong with that?
ROPER	I'm not sure.

ROPER	How are we gonna get him out of there?
MCCALL	We could fill it with water.

MCCALL	Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
ROPER	Not the ones I'm at.

ROPER	Come on. Let's go for a drink.
MCCALL	I don't really like to drink.
ROPER	You have to. It's a tradition.
MCCALL	Well, if I have to, I have to.

ROPER	You got a girlfriend?
MCCALL	Why? You like my ass?

ROPER	You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
MCCALL	I don't gamble.

MCCALL	Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
ROPER	You living together?
MCCALL	She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
ROPER	Explain how that works.
MCCALL	She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
ROPER	She grow up in Livingtston, too?
MCCALL	No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
ROPER	Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
MCCALL	We see each other every couple of months.
ROPER	Every couple of months, huh?

ROPER	That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
MCCALL	Do you really?
ROPER	No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
MCCALL	Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
ROPER	Where did you hear that?
MCCALL	Around. Barnett's tough competition.
ROPER	Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.

ROPER	Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
MCCALL	I think I can handle that one.
ROPER	Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.

ROPER	You think you can learn, McCall?
MCCALL	I think so.

ROPER	First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
MCCALL	No.
ROPER	It'll come. Try again.

MCCALL	Tell me what you need.
ROPER	I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.

MCCALL	I can't do that.
ROPER	Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.

ROPER	Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
MCCALL	So what do I say to this guy?
ROPER	You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
MCCALL	What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?

ROPER	If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
MCCALL	I'm not good at lying.
ROPER	Get good at it.
MCCALL	It's against my nature.

ROPER	You know the ten commandments?
MCCALL	Yes.
ROPER	What's the first commandment?
MCCALL	Thou shall have no other God before me.

MCCALL	You tell me.
ROPER	Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
MCCALL	Yes.
ROPER	Why?
MCCALL	To save lives.
ROPER	So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?

MCCALL	My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
ROPER	Okay, stop.

ROPER	What did you see?
MCCALL	A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.

MCCALL	Why did he do it?
ROPER	Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...

ROPER	You know why I like the track?
MCCALL	You're a compulsive gambler?

ROPER	See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
MCCALL	I have two words for you... Seek help.
ROPER	I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.

ROPER	I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
MCCALL	I do.

ROPER	We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
MCCALL	Fine.

ROPER	Ronnie... Yeah, so.
MCCALL	Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
ROPER	So what do you want?... An autograph.
MCCALL	I don't know why she'd pick him over you.

MCCALL	I'm just practicing my lying.
ROPER	Still needs work.
MCCALL	You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.

MCCALL	The 6 horse is last.
ROPER	That's okay. That's his style.
MCCALL	To run last?
ROPER	To run late!

MCCALL	The 6 horse is still last.
ROPER	He'll be running at the quarter pole.

MCCALL	They need to run first and second?
ROPER	Yeah, first and second.

MCCALL	COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
ROPER	The jockey!
MCCALL	COME ON, RUSSELL!

MCCALL	We won!
ROPER	We lost.
MCCALL	We won.
ROPER	How much you wanna bet?
MCCALL	You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.

MCCALL	How long you been coming here?
ROPER	About six years. My partner took me.
MCCALL	Is it always like this?
ROPER	Occasionally you lose.

ROPER	See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
MCCALL	Police corruption. It's everywhere.

MCCALL	There's your answer. He's smart.
ROPER	He's cutting down the visibility.
MCCALL	And doing a very good job of it.

MCCALL	He's got the girl.
ROPER	Damnit!

MCCALL	What the fuck is going on.
ROPER	I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
MCCALL	You're crazy.
ROPER	Pull up alongside.

ROPER	It might have happened no matter who was up there.
MCCALL	Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
ROPER	Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
MCCALL	I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
ROPER	That it is.

MCCALL	How many have you lost?
ROPER	I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
MCCALL	And what about the ones you don't save?
ROPER	You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
MCCALL	And what if you can't live with it?
ROPER	You've got to decide that for yourself.

ROPER	He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
MCCALL	So what do you want to do?
ROPER	That's a chance I gotta take.
MCCALL	Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.

MCCALL	Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
ROPER	Good question.

ROPER	McCall, you all right?
MCCALL	I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
ROPER	Stay put.

ROPER	Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
OFFICER #1	Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
ROPER	Which apartment?

ROPER	Have you evacuated anyone?
OFFICER #1	Only that floor.
ROPER	Is the hostage injured?
OFFICER #1	Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
ROPER	Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.

ROPER	I know how you feel, Ray.
RAYMOND	You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.

ROPER	I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
RAYMOND	You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
ROPER	Let me show you something, Ray.

ROPER	Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
RAYMOND	I ain't interested in your life story.
ROPER	Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
RAYMOND	She's the one to blame. Not me.

ROPER	Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
RAYMOND	What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.

ROPER	Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
RAYMOND	Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
ROPER	I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
RAYMOND	And why the fuck would you do that for me?
ROPER	Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
RAYMOND	Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
ROPER	My name's Scott Roper.

ROPER	This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
RONNIE	Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
ROPER	I worship you.
RONNIE	You worship yourself.
ROPER	Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
RONNIE	Greg.
ROPER	Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.

RONNIE	You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
ROPER	Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.

ROPER	Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
RONNIE	I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
ROPER	This Greg is really getting in my way.

ROPER	Please. I'm begging you.
RONNIE	Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.

RONNIE	Hey.
ROPER	Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
RONNIE	A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
ROPER	I'm not drunk. Yet.
RONNIE	Maybe you should be.
ROPER	You heard.

RONNIE	Yeah. I'm sorry.
ROPER	Can I come in?

ROPER	That a new picture?
RONNIE	About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.

ROPER	I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
RONNIE	You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
ROPER	It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
RONNIE	Scott, You can't save everyone.
ROPER	I've proved that, didn't I?

ROPER	Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
RONNIE	What do you want from me?
ROPER	Something I guess I can't have anymore.
RONNIE	Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
ROPER	You think I didn't need you?
RONNIE	If you did, you never showed it.
ROPER	Ronnie...

ROPER	I wanted to get this out of the way.
RONNIE	You got a bet on the game tonight?
ROPER	As a matter of fact, I do.

RONNIE	It's already started.
ROPER	I was going to catch the last half on TV.

ROPER	That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
RONNIE	No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
ROPER	I've been craving that stuff all week.
RONNIE	And it's hard to get.

ROPER	What do you think?
RONNIE	Mmm, needs a little something.
ROPER	What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
RONNIE	Yeah that's it.
ROPER	Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
RONNIE	Scottie...

RONNIE	Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
ROPER	It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
RONNIE	It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
ROPER	Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.

ROPER	What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
RONNIE	It's okay. We broke up.
ROPER	When?
RONNIE	Just now.

RONNIE	How's Paco doing?
ROPER	He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.

ROPER	You like this place?
RONNIE	It's very nice.
ROPER	I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.

RONNIE	There is?
ROPER	For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...

RONNIE	Yeah?
ROPER	...Let me just show you.

ROPER	How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
RONNIE	In Europe women find older men very sexy.

ROPER	Korda escaped.
RONNIE	And you think he'll...

RONNIE	I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
ROPER	Use your imagination.

ROPER	Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
RONNIE	I think I'll stand out here in the sun.

RONNIE	Scottie, Scottie...
ROPER	It's all over, babe, it's all over.

ROPER	Stay here, don't move.
RONNIE	Scottie...
ROPER	Do it!

RONNIE	I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
ROPER	Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.

RONNIE	Scottie?
ROPER	Hmm?
RONNIE	I've been thinking.

ROPER	Hmm?
RONNIE	Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
ROPER	Yeah.
RONNIE	You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.

RONNIE	I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
ROPER	A deeper level?
RONNIE	That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
ROPER	Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
RONNIE	Scott...
ROPER	I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
RONNIE	...the hell are you talking about?
ROPER	I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
RONNIE	I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
ROPER	You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
RONNIE	You thought I was talking about getting married?!

ROPER	You crazy? With all those people around?
RONNIE	Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
ROPER	The hell I am!
RONNIE	Prude.
ROPER	First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.

TRACK ANNOUNCER	...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
ROPER	Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...

TRACK ANNOUNCER	It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
ROPER	I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.

ROPER	Stay up there, Girl...
TRACK ANNOUNCER	Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...

ROPER	Where's the damn wire?!
TRACK ANNOUNCER	Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
ROPER	SHIT!

ROPER	Tell him to give me a raise.
SOLIS	He says, "Thank you very much."  I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.

SOLIS	Roper.
ROPER	What?
SOLIS	Are you going to make this hard for me?
ROPER	Depends. What's up?
SOLIS	There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
ROPER	Define concern.

SOLIS	What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
ROPER	Your concern is heartwarming.
SOLIS	It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
ROPER	Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
SOLIS	His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.

ROPER	Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
SOLIS	You let us worry about that.
ROPER	Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
SOLIS	What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
ROPER	The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
SOLIS	What do you think would be in order?
ROPER	Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
SOLIS	Okay, I think I could swing that.

ROPER	And a car.
SOLIS	Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
ROPER	You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
SOLIS	Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
ROPER	The car is part of the deal.
SOLIS	What happened to your Trans Am?

ROPER	Repoed this morning.
SOLIS	I'll provide you with transportation.
ROPER	And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...

SOLIS	The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
ROPER	He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
SOLIS	I can't do that.
ROPER	I want to be put on this case.
SOLIS	You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
ROPER	Who's running it?
SOLIS	Roper...
ROPER	Who's running it!
SOLIS	Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.

ROPER	What do we got?
SOLIS	32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
ROPER	Any verification on numbers.
SOLIS	We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
ROPER	What have you promised them?
SOLIS	Just that I'd talk to my superiors.

ROPER	Are these yours?
SOLIS	Yeah, they are but...
ROPER	Come on!

ALICE	Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
JULIE	Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...

ALICE	Special occasion?
JULIE	I don't know. I guess it was...

ALICE	Who did this?
JULIE	Stu. That was right about the time we met.
ALICE	When he first came in to the sleep lab?
JULIE	Yeah...before your time.

ALICE	Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
JULIE	He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.

ALICE	How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
JULIE	Switch hands.
ALICE	What?
JULIE	I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.

ALICE	Monkeybone?
JULIE	Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
ALICE	Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?

JULIE	What's the maximum safe dose?
ALICE	Most we've ever used is half a CC.
JULIE	Five CC's.

JULIE	The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
ALICE	Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
JULIE	I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.

JULIE	4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet.
ALICE	They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.

STU	Chasing me - animals - horrible -
BULL	Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?

BULL	Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
STU	Uhh - martini?
BULL	Olive or eyeball?
STU	Olive. - Where exactly am I?
BULL	Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
STU	Stu Miley.
BULL	Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.

STU	Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
BULL	Sad commentary, huh?

BULL	<i></i> I beg your pardon?
STU	I didn't say anything.

STU	I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
BULL	Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.

BULL	Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
STU	Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
BULL	Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
STU	I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -

STU	You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
DEATH	Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
STU	I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
DEATH	<u>Why</u>??
STU	I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
DEATH	I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
STU	Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
DEATH	Well - you'd need a body.

DEATH	If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
STU	Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
DEATH	<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
STU	Bend over?

STU	DEATH!!
DEATH	I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
STU	Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.

STU	Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
DEATH	Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
STU	Back? You're sending me back?
DEATH	It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
STU	Death! Thank you!
DEATH	Thank me next time you see me.

DR. EDELSTEIN	Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
KIMMY	Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
DR. EDELSTEIN	He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
KIMMY	But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?

DR. EDELSTEIN	At the moment, yes.
KIMMY	Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
DR. EDELSTEIN	Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
KIMMY	Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -

DR. EDELSTEIN	Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
KIMMY	I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.

HERB	What's the matter?
STU-BONE	I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
HERB	Less.

HERB	Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
STU-BONE	How much?
HERB	Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
STU-BONE	I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
HERB	And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.

HERB	You're really gonna pop the question?
STU-BONE	Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
HERB	I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
STU-BONE	Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.

HERB	Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
STU	Julie and I - we were just gonna go...

HERB	Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
STU	Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
HERB	Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -

STU	Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
HERB	Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
STU	I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
HERB	Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
STU	Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
HERB	Why?
STU	I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.

HERB	Oh my God...you're proposing?
STU	My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
HERB	...In some weird way I respect that.

STU	So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
HERB	A piñata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!

HUTCH	Holy shit.
JULIE	He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?

JULIE	No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
HUTCH	That's not going to stop his nightmare -
JULIE	I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.

HUTCH	You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
JULIE	What'll it do if they pull the plug?

HUTCH	The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
JULIE	Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -

HYPNOS	Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
STU	Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
HYPNOS	Uh huh. And?
STU	Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...

HYPNOS	Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
STU	Tell me what?
HYPNOS	It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
STU	Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -

STU	I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
HYPNOS	Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?

STU	Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
HYPNOS	Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
STU	Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.

HYPNOS	Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
STU	Maybe you could talk to Death!
HYPNOS	Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -

HYPNOS	Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
STU	You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
HYPNOS	Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?

STU	Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
HYPNOS	Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
STU	Hyp, I'll do anything.

STU	Land of Death. How do I get there?
HYPNOS	Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.

STU	NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
HYPNOS	Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!

HYPNOS	Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
STU	YOU SET ME UP!!

HYPNOS	Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
STU	Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
HYPNOS	It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
STU	But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
HYPNOS	The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
STU	Monkeybone...!?
HYPNOS	Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
STU	You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
HYPNOS	Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!

JULIE	Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
STU-BONE	Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?

STU-BONE	Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
JULIE	Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.

STU-BONE	Bitchin' good cake.
JULIE	Stu, are you...feeling okay?
STU-BONE	Sure. Why?
JULIE	You're acting kind of...odd.
STU-BONE	<i></i> In what way?

JULIE	What are you watching?
STU-BONE	Ohhh, nothing.

JULIE	You sure this is...medically advisable?
STU-BONE	Got a doctor on duty.
JULIE	Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -

STU-BONE	Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
JULIE	I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
STU-BONE	Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
JULIE	They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
STU-BONE	I need a new PR guy.

STU-BONE	And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
JULIE	I had to park two blocks away. Is something -

JULIE	What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
STU-BONE	Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.

JULIE	Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
STU-BONE	Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
JULIE	Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
STU-BONE	Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.

JULIE	You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
STU-BONE	<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?

STU-BONE	We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
JULIE	It looks so...<u>new</u>.
STU-BONE	It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
JULIE	But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
STU-BONE	Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?

STU-BONE	Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
JULIE	He called me "Doc."

JULIE	You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
STU	They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
JULIE	It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
STU	That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
JULIE	Can't you give it to me later?
STU	Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.

STU	Look at this! He won't let us leave!
JULIE	Who?
STU	The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
JULIE	Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
STU	I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
JULIE	What's the "bad" part?
STU	I might wake up.
JULIE	<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
STU	I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.

STU	Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
JULIE	I don't think so.
STU	Are you okay??

JULIE	I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
STU	I'd better go report this...

JULIE	Stu?
STU	Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.

STU	How was it? I don't recall.
JULIE	It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.

JULIE	Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
STU	Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.

JULIE	What's the matter?
STU	My <u>tail</u> itches.

KIMMY	Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
JULIE	When'd you get in?
KIMMY	An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
JULIE	I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
KIMMY	I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
JULIE	The ring...
KIMMY	Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -

JULIE	Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
KIMMY	Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
JULIE	It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
KIMMY	Give me a date, Doctor.

JULIE	Kimmy! What's the matter?
KIMMY	This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.

STU	Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
KITTY	Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.

KITTY	Hypnos?
STU	Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.

KITTY	I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
STU	Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
KITTY	You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
STU	Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??

KITTY	Don't ask where I got it.
STU	You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
KITTY	You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
STU	How am I gonna get past the guards?
KITTY	<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.

KITTY	Go. Just <u>go</u>.
STU	Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--

STU	<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
MONKEYBONE	I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
STU	Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
MONKEYBONE	Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
STU	I am not. And I don't gotta.

MONKEYBONE	You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
STU	Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.

MONKEYBONE	Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
STU	I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?

MONKEYBONE	My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
STU	<i></i> I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?

MONKEYBONE	Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
STU	THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
MONKEYBONE	FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -

MONKEYBONE	I'm reportin' this to my union!!
STU	<u>What</u> union?
MONKEYBONE	The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!

MONKEYBONE	I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
STU	Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.

STU	He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
MONKEYBONE	Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
STU	<i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!

STU	<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
MONKEYBONE	Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
STU	I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
MONKEYBONE	Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.

MONKEYBONE	Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
STU	Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.

STU	How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
MONKEYBONE	Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
STU	Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -

MONKEYBONE	Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
STU	Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!

MONKEYBONE	I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
STU	Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.

MONKEYBONE	Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
STU	Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
MONKEYBONE	Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
STU	<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.

MONKEYBONE	Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
STU	No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.

MONKEYBONE	You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
STU	All right. You can come.
MONKEYBONE	OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
STU	Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.

STU	He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
MONKEYBONE	Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?

STU	Where'd he go??
MONKEYBONE	I don't <u>know</u>.

MONKEYBONE	Stu...Stu...
STU	IT'S NOT WORKING.
MONKEYBONE	There's a thing here! There's a switch!

MONKEYBONE	Stu...LOOK!
STU	What?
MONKEYBONE	Isn't that Lulu?

STU	You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
MONKEYBONE	Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
STU	It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
MONKEYBONE	Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
STU	You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.

MONKEYBONE	Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
STU	Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--

CASANOVA	I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
AMAZING	I know you did.
CASANOVA	I knew you'd know.
AMAZING	I know you knew I'd know.
CASANOVA	But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
AMAZING	Of course.

AMAZING	The jig is up, Casanova. I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
CASANOVA	Really?
AMAZING	I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...

AMAZING	And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
CASANOVA	I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
AMAZING	Um-hmm.
CASANOVA	Except for one little thing.
AMAZING	And what's that?
CASANOVA	That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
AMAZING	What --?

CASANOVA	Everything's going exactly as we planned.
ANABEL	Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
CASANOVA	It must have slipped my mind.
ANABEL	Your mind is so slippery.
CASANOVA	Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 

ANABEL	Where are you going?
CASANOVA	Head hunting.

ANABEL	What are you doing all alone in the dark?
CASANOVA	Fantasizing... about you.

CASANOVA	I thought you were done?
ANABEL	One last tweak.

ANABEL	Our guests are waiting.
CASANOVA	I'll be down in a jiffy.

ANABEL	You two timing psychotic bastard.
CASANOVA	Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
ANABEL	Do I?
CASANOVA	I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.

SHOVELER	The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
BOWLER	I'm his daughter.

SHOVELER	Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
BOWLER	Really?

BOWLER	And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
SHOVELER	So who killed him?
BOWLER	The Disco Boys.

SHOVELER	We didn't think this through very well.
BOWLER	My father had this friend... He was an inventor...

BOWLER	He was the last time I saw him.
SHOVELER	When was that?
BOWLER	I was eight.

BOWLER	Much less go outside.
SHOVELER	Then Captain Amazing appeared.

BOWLER	We could really use some coffee --
SHOVELER	And some sandwiches --

SHOVELER	Come on, baby!
BOWLER	Do it, big boy!

SHOVELER	Atta, girl!
BOWLER	Atta, boy!

BOWLER	Hey, do I look like a Man?
SHOVELER	Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.

RAJA	Who are you?
BOWLER	I'm the Bowler.

RAJA	And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
BOWLER	He was cute though.
RAJA	But they all had one thing we haven't got.

BOWLER	How about... the Savage Six?
RAJA	The Inscrutable Six?

BOWLER	But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
RAJA	I can't.

RAJA	I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
BOWLER	But you're a superhero.
RAJA	The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
BOWLER	I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
RAJA	But in fact... you'd found it.

BOWLER	It's late. I'm headin' home.
RAJA	Me, too.
BOWLER	Come on, Junior, it's a school night.

RAJA	No one will believe us.
BOWLER	They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.

BOWLER	Sounds good to me.
RAJA	Let's do it.

RAJA	But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
BOWLER	Or even what it looks like.

FURIOUS	Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
BOWLER	I thought you'd never ask.

BOWLER	That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
FURIOUS	Half a Dirty Dozen!

FURIOUS	Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
BOWLER	What did he mean?
FURIOUS	I dunno.

BOWLER	Mon Captain, it's for you. 
FURIOUS	Hello?

BOWLER	Hey... you okay?
FURIOUS	Sure.

BOWLER	Eat your mustard.
FURIOUS	It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.

HELLER	Yes!
BOWLER	Doctor Heller?
HELLER	Yes!
BOWLER	It's me... Elizabeth.
HELLER	Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
BOWLER	Thanks.
HELLER	How's your dad?
BOWLER	He's dead.
HELLER	Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.

BOWLER	Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
HELLER	Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --

HELLER	Snap out of it!
BOWLER	Get on to yourself!

HELLER	He'll never make it.
BOWLER	Think positive.

CASANOVA	I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
TONY P	Ummm.
CASANOVA	Have you considered my offer?
TONY P	You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...

TONY P	But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
CASANOVA	I got it.
TONY P	What about Captain Amazing?

CASANOVA	Superheroes.
TONY P	Should I kill them?
CASANOVA	Why bother?

CASANOVA	That boy's got talent.
TONY P	And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.

FURIOUS	What did you do with Captain Amazing?
CASANOVA	Captain who?

CASANOVA	I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
FURIOUS	You're nuts.
CASANOVA	They always call the great ones nuts.
FURIOUS	And the nuts always call themselves great.
CASANOVA	Are you with me... or against me?
FURIOUS	Against.
CASANOVA	Too bad. PLUG HIM!

FURIOUS	Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
CASANOVA	You're dead.
FURIOUS	So are you!

CASANOVA	And the light goes out...
FURIOUS	Frankenstein!

CASANOVA	Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
FURIOUS	They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!

CASANOVA	I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
MONICA	Really?

CASANOVA	Are you an actress?
MONICA	Just a waitress.
CASANOVA	You underestimate yourself.

CASANOVA	You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
MONICA	Really?
CASANOVA	I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
MONICA	Sure -- I guess.
CASANOVA	Terrific.

MONICA	Hi.
CASANOVA	I thought you'd chickened out on me.
MONICA	Just wanted to... powder my nose.

MONICA	How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
CASANOVA	Why not?

MONICA	Who's the artist?
CASANOVA	Me.

CASANOVA	Come here.
MONICA	I'm not that kind of girl.
CASANOVA	Then why are you here?
MONICA	Curiosity.
CASANOVA	Remember the cat.

MONICA	I'd better go.
CASANOVA	You're a spy.
MONICA	What?
CASANOVA	I saw him walk you home.
MONICA	Who?
CASANOVA	Roy.

MONICA	Stay away!
CASANOVA	Or you'll what? CAN ME?

FURIOUS	Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
MONICA	I guess... Are you always so angry?
FURIOUS	Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?

FURIOUS	Or talk?
MONICA	Not tonight. 

FURIOUS	Hi.
MONICA	Alone tonight?
FURIOUS	Every night.

FURIOUS	Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
MONICA	Date?
FURIOUS	Yeah.
MONICA	I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
FURIOUS	Sure.
MONICA	That was easy. 

MONICA	I admire you.
FURIOUS	Why?
MONICA	Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
FURIOUS	It is?
MONICA	Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
FURIOUS	I wouldn't mind being famous.
MONICA	Who wouldn't?

MONICA	I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
FURIOUS	Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
MONICA	What's your real name?
FURIOUS	Roy.
MONICA	Have you always lived here?

MONICA	Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
FURIOUS	It's home.
MONICA	Yeah.

MONICA	I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
FURIOUS	What have they got that we ain't got?
MONICA	Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
FURIOUS	Me, too.
MONICA	You don't seem very angry right now.

MONICA	You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
FURIOUS	I just want to be a superhero.
MONICA	That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.

MONICA	It's me.
FURIOUS	Monica, where are you?

MONICA	At the Frankenstein Center.
FURIOUS	Are you nuts? Get out of there!
MONICA	I'm going inside.
FURIOUS	What are you talking about?
MONICA	Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
FURIOUS	He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
MONICA	Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
FURIOUS	And what if you get killed?
MONICA	Then at least I will have died trying, right?

MONICA	Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
FURIOUS	What?
MONICA	Bye. 
FURIOUS	Monica!

FURIOUS	So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.

FURIOUS	If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.

FURIOUS	So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
INVISIBLE BOY	I just know.

FURIOUS	Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
INVISIBLE BOY	I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?

INVISIBLE BOY	Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
FURIOUS	Good or evil, what's the difference?

FURIOUS	You're the Sphinx.
SPHINX	And you are a fool.

FURIOUS	But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
SPHINX	The wise snake coils before he strikes.
FURIOUS	And a skunk stinks!

SPHINX	You drink too much.
FURIOUS	When are you going to take off that mask?
SPHINX	When I am sure I am among friends.

SPHINX	Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
FURIOUS	My heart died a long time ago.
SPHINX	It is not dead. It is hiding.
FURIOUS	Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 

FURIOUS	Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
FURIOUS	And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
SPHINX	Now you're talking.

FURIOUS	We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
SPHINX	He is in love. His anger is gone.

SHOVELER	Oh don't start that again --
FURIOUS	LOOK!

SHOVELER	Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
FURIOUS	We had an off night, that's all.
SHOVELER	So when are we gonna have an on night?

SHOVELER	What are you talking about?
FURIOUS	What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?

SHOVELER	And it would be the right thing to do.
FURIOUS	Yeah yeah -- and that, too.

SHOVELER	I'm liking this.
FURIOUS	I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!

FURIOUS	Have you ever seen him?
SHOVELER	How could I see him if he's invisible?
FURIOUS	Good point.

FURIOUS	You sure that's how you spell it?
SHOVELER	Yeah.

SHOVELER	There's just not enough of us.
FURIOUS	But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...

SHOVELER	There's a big difference.
FURIOUS	I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.

FURIOUS	You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
SHOVELER	But there's still only six of us.
FURIOUS	SO WHAT?

FURIOUS	So what else has Superman got?
SHOVELER	He's got the fact that he's Superman!

SHOVELER	This place is built like a fortress.
FURIOUS	Because that's what it is.

SHOVELER	GET MAD!
FURIOUS	But I just don't feel it.

SHOVELER	Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
FURIOUS	Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.

FURIOUS	But she still might call!
SHOVELER	Are you coming or not?
FURIOUS	I'll drive.
SHOVELER	Not a chance!

FURIOUS	Cover me!
SHOVELER	With what?

RAJA	He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
FURIOUS	What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!

FURIOUS	He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
RAJA	There's a vague similarity.
FURIOUS	A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!

FURIOUS	We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
RAJA	But look at him... and look at us.

FURIOUS	Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
RAJA	I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
FURIOUS	So why don't you just tell her!
RAJA	I can't.
FURIOUS	Why not?
RAJA	Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!

FURIOUS	Nah.
RAJA	Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
FURIOUS	What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
RAJA	So you're chicken?
FURIOUS	Who's chicken? 

RAJA	Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
FURIOUS	Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
RAJA	Or flowers.
FURIOUS	See ya tomorrow.

FURIOUS	I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
RAJA	But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.

FURIOUS	Let's go.
RAJA	Wait!... Look!

FURIOUS	The who?
RAJA	The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
FURIOUS	Well they've crawled back out.

RAJA	I'm soaked.  Oh great.
FURIOUS	Shhh.

RAJA	Maybe she's right.
FURIOUS	Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!

RAJA	Agents?
FURIOUS	Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!

RAJA	But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
FURIOUS	Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!

FURIOUS	Sounds good.
RAJA	No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.

RAJA	Maybe there was traffic.
FURIOUS	Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!

RAJA	Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
FURIOUS	Oh shut up.

RAJA	Roy --
FURIOUS	Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!

RAJA	So where's the art?
FURIOUS	He hasn't stolen it yet.

RAJA	What's that?
FURIOUS	Come on.

RAJA	He's turned into a completely normal person!
FURIOUS	Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?

RAJA	But... only when no one is looking.
INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.

RAJA	So you're only invisible... to yourself?
INVISIBLE BOY	No.

RAJA	So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
INVISIBLE BOY	Yes.

INVISIBLE BOY	The Obliterators!
RAJA	The Eradicators!

RAJA	Firepower costs money.
INVISIBLE BOY	Anybody got any?

RAJA	Yes, Obie-wan.
INVISIBLE BOY	Hey... he's gone.

MONICA	You guys going to a costume party?
RAJA	We're superheroes.
MONICA	Really? Like Captain Amazing?

MONICA	Are you famous?
RAJA	Not yet.
MONICA	So you're like... struggling superheroes?
RAJA	We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
MONICA	Wow.
RAJA	And these are my associates, the Shoveler.

MONICA	Really?
RAJA	Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
MONICA	So what can I get you?
RAJA	Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.

MONICA	Here you go. 
RAJA	Ow.
MONICA	Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.

MOTHER	Jeffrey!
RAJA	Oh hi, Mom.
MOTHER	What are you doing in the silver drawer?
RAJA	Looking for... the TV Guide.

MOTHER	It's on the television.
RAJA	Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.

MOTHER	Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
RAJA	Mother... it's not what you think!
MOTHER	And why are you wearing that silly costume?
RAJA	Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!

RAJA	Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
MOTHER	But... the silverware?
RAJA	I use it... to fight evil.
MOTHER	Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
RAJA	It is?
MOTHER	I always knew that you were special.
RAJA	You did?
MOTHER	Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.

SHOVELER	Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
RAJA	We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
SHOVELER	How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?

SHOVELER	Hi.
RAJA	And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.

RAJA	She likes you.
SHOVELER	Definitely.
RAJA	Ask her out.

RAJA	This is bad.
SHOVELER	Who are they?
RAJA	The Disco Boys.

SHOVELER	We may be getting in over our heads here.
RAJA	This looks like a job for Superman --
SHOVELER	Or Batman --
RAJA	Or both.

RAJA	Don't crunch the leaves.
SHOVELER	Sorry.
RAJA	Be a Mohican. 

SHOVELER	Be a Mohican.
RAJA	Shut up.

RAJA	Do we have to?
SHOVELER	I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.

RAJA	And there's the Sphinx.
SHOVELER	The who?
RAJA	He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.

RAJA	And a social life.
SHOVELER	Yeah, but how do we get to them?

SHOVELER	To us!
RAJA	Whatever our name is.

SHOVELER	Are you sure he's still lives here?
RAJA	Are you sure he's still alive?

RAJA	But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
SHOVELER	The bazookas?

RAJA	Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
SHOVELER	Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.

RAJA	He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
SHOVELER	And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.

SHOVELER	Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
RAJA	But how do we get in?

RAJA	That was too close.
SHOVELER	But we gotta find out what's going on in there.

RAJA	We're outnumbered twenty to one.
SHOVELER	It's suicide.

RAJA	Oh no.
SHOVELER	Great timing!

SHOVELER	It's time.
RAJA	With or without him, we gotta go!

SHOVELER	We've got lift off!
RAJA	May the forks be with us!

SHOVELER	Where am I going?
RAJA	Through there!
SHOVELER	Right.

BABY'D	Okay, I know what I want this time.
DAY-DAY	Anything you need.
BABY'D	Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
DAY-DAY	That's it?
BABY'D	Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
DAY-DAY	And I can go free?
BABY'D	Go, fo' I change my mind.

UNCLE ELROY	Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
CRAIG	Naw, it ain't like that.
UNCLE ELROY	If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
CRAIG	Alright, I'll remember that.
UNCLE ELROY	You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?

UNCLE ELROY	Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
CRAIG	Thanks, Unc.

UNCLE ELROY	Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
CRAIG	Yeah.
UNCLE ELROY	Well, let me in.
CRAIG	Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?

UNCLE ELROY	Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
CRAIG	You paid cash?
UNCLE ELROY	Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.

CRAIG	It's cool, but where's the water?
UNCLE ELROY	Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
CRAIG	Y'all never use it?
UNCLE ELROY	Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.

CRAIG	That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
UNCLE ELROY	Good.

UNCLE ELROY	I know you smoke weed, right?
CRAIG	Why you say that?
UNCLE ELROY	'Cause your lips is getting black.

UNCLE ELROY	Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
CRAIG	I don't know!
UNCLE ELROY	Suga!

CRAIG	I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
UNCLE ELROY	Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.

UNCLE ELROY	No.  Thought he was with you.
CRAIG	Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help.

UNCLE ELROY	Me, too.  You think they're in there?
CRAIG	Yup.

CRAIG	That's a nice piece of heat right there.
UNCLE ELROY	Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.

CRAIG	Stretch it out.
UNCLE ELROY	Don't move me.

D'WANA	Who are you?
CRAIG	I'm his cousin.

D'WANA	We didn't come here for Day-Day.
CRAIG	Yes you did.
D'WANA	No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.

D'WANA	Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
CRAIG	I don't know... I think he went out the back.
D'WANA	Can I look for myself?

CRAIG	Where you going?
D'WANA	Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.

CRAIG	No I'm not.
ROACH	I'll do it.

ROACH	Great moves, Day-Day.
CRAIG	What happen?

CRAIG	What you mean talk to her?
ROACH	You know what he mean, dude.
CRAIG	I'm gone.

ROACH	For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
CRAIG	Not me.

CRAIG	Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
ROACH	That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.

CRAIG	What's the green stuff poking out?
ROACH	That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
CRAIG	Naw, I already ate.
ROACH	Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.

ROACH	Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
CRAIG	Black magic.

ROACH	Me neither.
CRAIG	It's something in that hydraulic pump.

CRAIG	It's about to work, just come on.
ROACH	What about the dog?

ROACH	Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
CRAIG	Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
ROACH	Fuck, what's his name?
CRAIG	Cheeco.

CRAIG	I ain't trying to rob you...
PINKY	Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
CRAIG	Man, Day-Day is my people!
PINKY	I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
CRAIG	Nobody!
PINKY	If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!

CRAIG	Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
PINKY	Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.

CRAIG	What's crackin'?
DAY-DAY	You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.

DAY-DAY	You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
CRAIG	I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.

DAY-DAY	Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
CRAIG	I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
DAY-DAY	I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.

CRAIG	Who is that?
DAY-DAY	Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
CRAIG	They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
DAY-DAY	Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.

CRAIG	This you?
DAY-DAY	Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
CRAIG	Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
DAY-DAY	Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
CRAIG	This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.

CRAIG	Man, this a cool house.
DAY-DAY	Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.

DAY-DAY	Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
CRAIG	Oh, yeah, where you work at?
DAY-DAY	Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
CRAIG	Thanks for reminding me.

DAY-DAY	I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
CRAIG	Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.

DAY-DAY	She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
CRAIG	I know, be still.

CRAIG	You straight?
DAY-DAY	Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?

CRAIG	Just a little.
DAY-DAY	I can't taste nothing.
CRAIG	What's the matter with your girlfriend?
DAY-DAY	Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
CRAIG	What?
DAY-DAY	Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
CRAIG	Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
DAY-DAY	I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
CRAIG	Damn, you got a stalker.
DAY-DAY	That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
CRAIG	You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
DAY-DAY	You don't know Baby D.

CRAIG	Who is that?
DAY-DAY	That's the sister.
CRAIG	Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
DAY-DAY	I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
CRAIG	Why?
DAY-DAY	Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.

DAY-DAY	So.
CRAIG	What you mean, so?
DAY-DAY	If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.

CRAIG	I walked.
DAY-DAY	You walked?
CRAIG	Yeah, ya'll got a notice today.  It came certified mail.

DAY-DAY	You know what this is?
CRAIG	Yeah, that's why I walked down here.

DAY-DAY	How can they do this?
CRAIG	I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?

DAY-DAY	It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
CRAIG	Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?

DAY-DAY	$247.
CRAIG	Okay, plan B.

CRAIG	What's the matter?
DAY-DAY	D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.

CRAIG	I ain't trying to get in it.
DAY-DAY	You already in.

CRAIG	You better stop running from that girl.
DAY-DAY	Fuuuuuuck -- U!

DAY-DAY	Thanks a lot, Craig.
CRAIG	I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
DAY-DAY	Big bitches need love, too, Craig.

CRAIG	I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
DAY-DAY	I don't.

CRAIG	You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
DAY-DAY	Ain't no windows in here.

DAY-DAY	Blow.
CRAIG	That ain't gonna work.

DAY-DAY	It works.
CRAIG	Still gonna smell it.

CRAIG	This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
DAY-DAY	Out the door and to the left.

DAY-DAY	Craig, what the hell are you doing?
CRAIG	Nothing.

DAY-DAY	What we gonna do?
CRAIG	I don't know yet.

DAY-DAY	Alright, Roach, see you around.
CRAIG	Sorry about today, man.

CRAIG	You see that?
DAY-DAY	I didn't see nothing.

DAY-DAY	Yeah, air.
CRAIG	Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
DAY-DAY	How you know?  It could be anything.
CRAIG	I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.

DAY-DAY	Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
CRAIG	What's the B-G's?
DAY-DAY	The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.

DAY-DAY	You make it sound so easy.
CRAIG	It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.

CRAIG	You go first.
DAY-DAY	Naw, you go first.
CRAIG	You go first.
DAY-DAY	No.
CRAIG	Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
DAY-DAY	I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.

DAY-DAY	I hope to God that dog is happy.
CRAIG	Me too.

CRAIG	Wait.
DAY-DAY	Wait for what?

DAY-DAY	What you see?
CRAIG	That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
DAY-DAY	Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
CRAIG	No, man, just wait.

CRAIG	You're welcome, Unc.
DAY-DAY	What about me?

DAY-DAY	You sure you don't wanna stay?
CRAIG	Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
DAY-DAY	I will.  When can I come visit?
CRAIG	I don't know.  Probably next Friday.

KARLA	Karla.
CRAIG	Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
KARLA	To the Cucamonga shopping center.
CRAIG	Oh yeah, why you walking?
KARLA	My brothers won't give me a ride.

CRAIG	You want us to give you a ride?
KARLA	I don't know.
CRAIG	What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here.

KARLA	Hello, remember me?
CRAIG	Hell yeah, I remember you.
KARLA	I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
CRAIG	It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
KARLA	I just wanted to give you this.

CRAIG	Most definitely.
KARLA	Better sooner than later.

CRAIG	Huh?
KARLA	What are you doing here?
CRAIG	I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
KARLA	What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
CRAIG	Yes I did.  Excuse me.

KARLA	You did all this for me?
CRAIG	Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
KARLA	Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
CRAIG	Why didn't she put'em out?
KARLA	Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
CRAIG	I'm sorry to hear that.

CRAIG	I did.  Is that door locked?
KARLA	It's locked.
CRAIG	Make sure.

CRAIG	I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
KARLA	So what?  Let's make'em wait.

KARLA	Next time, page me first.
CRAIG	Okay.

KARLA	You alright?
CRAIG	Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.

DELIVERY GUY	Delivery!
CRAIG	Hold on.

DELIVERY GUY	Delivery!
CRAIG	I said hold on!
DELIVERY GUY	Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.

CRAIG	Can I help you?
DELIVERY GUY	Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
CRAIG	I don't play for no team.
DELIVERY GUY	Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
CRAIG	Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
DELIVERY GUY	Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.

CRAIG	What is it?
DELIVERY GUY	Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.

CRAIG	I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
MR. JONES	Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!

CRAIG	Here I come!
MR. JONES	Well bring yo' ass on...

CRAIG	What's the matter?
MR. JONES	I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!

MR. JONES	That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.
CRAIG	Ya'll making me look like a punk.
MR. JONES	It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's about this...

MR. JONES	Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
CRAIG	I do.
MR. JONES	What it smell like?
CRAIG	Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.

MR. JONES	I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
CRAIG	All damn.
MR. JONES	Just hold your breath.

MR. JONES	Nice neighborhood, huh?
CRAIG	It's alright.
MR. JONES	18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
CRAIG	Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!

CRAIG	You coming in?
MR. JONES	No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
CRAIG	Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get me in trouble no more.

MR. JONES	Craig, remember what I told you.
CRAIG	I'll remember.

MR. JONES	Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
CRAIG	Have you seen Day-Day?

CRAIG	You see that?
MR. JONES	I saw it.

CRAIG	Come on.

MR. JONES	Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
CRAIG	Yeah, pops!

CRAIG	You too.
MR. JONES	Smokin' what?
CRAIG	Nothing.

MISS HO KYM	My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
CRAIG	Excuse me?
MISS HO KYM	I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?

CRAIG	Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
MISS HO KYM	Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.

CRAIG	What kind of activity?
MISS HO KYM	Strange activity.  I think they running drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe me.

MISS HO KYM	See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
CRAIG	Nice to meet you?
MISS HO KYM	Peace out, Craig.

MISS HO KYM	Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
CRAIG	It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.

CUSTOMER #1	I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
DAY-DAY	Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?

CUSTOMER #1	No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
DAY-DAY	Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
CUSTOMER #1	I don't have no damn cover.

DAY-DAY	I can't give you your damn money back on this.
CUSTOMER #1	Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
DAY-DAY	Well, you gonna have to go postal then.

DAY-DAY	Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
ROACH	I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.

ROACH	Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
DAY-DAY	Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?

DAY-DAY	Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
ROACH	What up, bro?

ROACH	What it say?
DAY-DAY	Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.

ROACH	What is it?
DAY-DAY	Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.

ROACH	That the big one, huh?
DAY-DAY	You damn right that's the big one.

DAY-DAY	What was that?
ROACH	You don't wanna know.

DAY-DAY	Are they still out there?
ROACH	Negative...they vamped.

DAY-DAY	Today ain't my day.
ROACH	Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.

ROACH	I do.
DAY-DAY	Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
ROACH	Sorry, dude.

DAY-DAY	Roach, what are you doing?
ROACH	R-U-S-H Intensely.

DAY-DAY	I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
ROACH	You could sell your Beamer.

DAY-DAY	I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
ROACH	Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
DAY-DAY	Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
ROACH	I know.

ROACH	Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
DAY-DAY	Let it go, Roach, trust me.
ROACH	I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
DAY-DAY	Let it go!

ROACH	I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
DAY-DAY	Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.

ROACH	Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
DAY-DAY	Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.

DAY-DAY	Roach...Roach, come on.
ROACH	Where's Craig?
DAY-DAY	He's inside the house?
ROACH	Why did he go in the house?
DAY-DAY	Don't worry about it.  We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.

DAY-DAY	You wanna knock?
ROACH	Go for it.

DAY-DAY	'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
ROACH	This is a knock.

DAY-DAY	Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
ROACH	And some rolling papers.
DAY-DAY	...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?

ROACH	Hey.
DAY-DAY	Ya'll live around here?

DAY-DAY	What?!  What that mean?
ROACH	I don't know.

DAY-DAY	Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
ROACH	Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday.

DAY-DAY	Get 'em, Craig!
ROACH	Bite his ear!

DAY-DAY	Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
ROACH	He's a boy, dude.

ROACH	Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
DAY-DAY	Thanks for the help.
ROACH	Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
DAY-DAY	Call me.
ROACH	Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.

UNCLE ELROY	Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
DAY-DAY	20 minutes?
UNCLE ELROY	Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.

UNCLE ELROY	Ah damn.  Damn.
DAY-DAY	I got fired too.
UNCLE ELROY	What?!

UNCLE ELROY	When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
DAY-DAY	I know.  I'm sorry.
UNCLE ELROY	Sorry, my ass.

DAY-DAY	Where's Craig?
UNCLE ELROY	I don't know.

JOKER	What the fuck you looking at?
DAY-DAY	Nothing.

DAY-DAY	Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
JOKER	What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
DAY-DAY	Alright, no problem.  We gone.

JOKER	Shut up!  Both of you right now!
DAY-DAY	Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
JOKER	I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.

DAY-DAY	Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
JOKER	Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?

JOKER	Tape his mouth shut.
DAY-DAY	Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.

DEBO	Where did Craig move to?
EZAL	I don't know, Debo.

DEBO	What you say?
EZAL	He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
DEBO	Rancho Cucamonga?
EZAL	Yeah.

DEBO	Get on.
EZAL	Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
DEBO	Get on!

DEBO	Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
EZAL	What urgent message?
DEBO	If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
EZAL	That ain't gonna work.

DEBO	Just do it.
EZAL	I don't know the number.

DEBO	William.
EZAL	Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.

EZAL	You too big.
DEBO	Keep pushing.

EZAL	Debo!  Debo!
DEBO	What?
EZAL	I can't feel my legs no more.
DEBO	Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
EZAL	I don't know.

DEBO	Ezal!  Ezal!
EZAL	Huh?
DEBO	We must be here 'cause we stopped.
EZAL	Good, let's get out.

DEBO	Hey, how you get out of here.
EZAL	I don't know.

KARLA	I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
JOKER	I'll take you later.
KARLA	When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
JOKER	Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.

KARLA	Hey, what's going on?
JOKER	Nothing.  What you want?
KARLA	Are you going to take me to see Mom?
JOKER	Take your car.
KARLA	'Take your car?'
JOKER	Yeah, and hurry up.

MR. JONES	Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
UNCLE ELROY	Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?

MR. JONES	I got your message.  Where's Craig?
UNCLE ELROY	I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
MR. JONES	You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
UNCLE ELROY	Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
MR. JONES	Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
UNCLE ELROY	I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.

MR. JONES	You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
UNCLE ELROY	Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
MR. JONES	Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.

UNCLE ELROY	What about that ugly dog?
MR. JONES	I got my mase.

MR. JONES	Need to lose some weight.
UNCLE ELROY	Shut yo' ass up.

UNCLE ELROY	Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
MR. JONES	The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.

UNCLE ELROY	My back.
MR. JONES	What's the matter?
UNCLE ELROY	I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.

MR. JONES	Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
UNCLE ELROY	Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.

UNCLE ELROY	Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
SUGA	Oooh, ba-by!

UNCLE ELROY	Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
SUGA	Elroy.
UNCLE ELROY	Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
SUGA	Okay.  Bye, Craig.

SUGA	Huh?
UNCLE ELROY	What you doing to my nephew?
SUGA	Ah, baby...I thought this was you.  Craig, what are you doing to me?

SUGA	Mr. Nasty time?
UNCLE ELROY	Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
SUGA	Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.

SUGA	Elroy, what happen?
UNCLE ELROY	I threw my back, again.
SUGA	Aw, no lovin' tonight?
UNCLE ELROY	Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
SUGA	Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
UNCLE ELROY	For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!

CINDY	Are you okay?
ALEX	Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
CINDY	That's always tough. How long were you together?
ALEX	Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
CINDY	No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...

CINDY	Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
ALEX	Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
CINDY	I found a picture of his wife.
ALEX	Wife?!

ALEX	Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
CINDY	I think he wants me.
ALEX	Ha! Right bitch!

ALEX	No, I won't let you do it.
CINDY	Alex, what are you doing?
ALEX	Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.

ALEX	Hey, Brenda.
BRENDA	Do I know you?
ALEX	Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.

ALEX	Me, too. 101?
BRENDA	In room "302" at ten o'clock?
ALEX	That's it.
BRENDA	Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.

ALEX	And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
THEO	Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
ALEX	Oh... I guess I'll die now.
THEO	Okay... maybe that would be best.

ALEX	Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
THEO	Never happened!

ALEX	My favorite memory was when we --
THEO	Would you die already?!

CINDY	We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
BRENDA	Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
CINDY	Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
BRENDA	Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
CINDY	Really? That's amazing.
BRENDA	Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
CINDY	Thanks.
BRENDA	You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
CINDY	Psychology.

BRENDA	Ouch!!
CINDY	Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
BRENDA	No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...

CINDY	Help!
BRENDA	Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.

CINDY	Oh my God! We're dead!
BRENDA	It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.

CINDY	It's coming!
BRENDA	What?! What is it, a monster?!

BRENDA	Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
CINDY	Hey, I have an idea...

CINDY	Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
BRENDA	Okay.

BRENDA	Cindy, what's going on?
CINDY	It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!

PROFESSOR	This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
BRENDA	Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
PROFESSOR	No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
BRENDA	Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
PROFESSOR	No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
BRENDA	But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
PROFESSOR	He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.

RAY	Hello Brenda.
BRENDA	Hello Ray.

RAY	Shhh... It's okay.
BRENDA	Ray, have you been here all this time?
RAY	I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
BRENDA	I'm fine. Just a few bruises.
RAY	So, I guess I can go now.
BRENDA	No, stay.
RAY	You sure?
BRENDA	Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
RAY	Yeah, me too.

BRENDA	Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
RAY	Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.

RAY	He's right. I should go first.
BRENDA	He's so brave.

BRENDA	Where's Shorty?
RAY	I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.

BRENDA	Ray, run faster.
RAY	Okay.

BUDDY	Hey, you left your book back there.
CINDY	Thanks. I'm Cindy.

BUDDY	So, I see you're really into spooks.
CINDY	No. I never date outside my race.
BUDDY	I meant you're into ghosts.
CINDY	Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
BUDDY	So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
CINDY	Yeah.
BUDDY	Maybe we can study together or something.
CINDY	I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.

CINDY	But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
BUDDY	Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
CINDY	Okay. See you later, friend.

CINDY	Hi Buddy.
BUDDY	Open chest!!!

CINDY	You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
BUDDY	Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
CINDY	That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
BUDDY	Then what kinda stuff can we do?
CINDY	Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
BUDDY	It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
CINDY	Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
BUDDY	Sure. We can practice talking.
CINDY	Okay.

CINDY	Buddy...
BUDDY	Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.

BUDDY	Dude, somebody's on the rag.
CINDY	Shhh!

BUDDY	Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
CINDY	Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
BUDDY	Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.

BUDDY	Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
CINDY	Alright!

BUDDY	Where the hell are we?
CINDY	It looks like the furnace.
BUDDY	Let's get outta here.
CINDY	Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.

BUDDY	Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
CINDY	Hugh Kane.

BUDDY	Yeah, I think I'm bleeding.
CINDY	Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.

BUDDY	Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
CINDY	That we should take our friendship a little further?
BUDDY	Yes...
CINDY	Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
BUDDY	I was thinking the same thing.

CINDY	We should act out our inner most fantasies.
BUDDY	Great!!!
CINDY	Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
BUDDY	Huh?

CINDY	What about you, Buddy?
BUDDY	Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.

CINDY	He's here.
BUDDY	Shit!

BUDDY	What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
CINDY	Can you feel that?
BUDDY	No. Try a little higher.

CINDY	Feel that?
BUDDY	No. Keep rubbing.

BUDDY	Better try a little higher.
CINDY	Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
BUDDY	Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
CINDY	Well... okay... but only as a friend.

BUDDY	Cindy, let me...
CINDY	No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
BUDDY	Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.

BUDDY	There's something I really want to share with you.
CINDY	There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.

BUDDY	Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
CINDY	Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
BUDDY	I know, but I've been thinking --
CINDY	I know, but I've been thinking --
BUDDY	Listen to me I --
CINDY	Listen to me I --
BUDDY	Look, what I'm trying to say --
CINDY	Look, what I'm trying to say --

BUDDY	Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
CINDY	Oh.
BUDDY	I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
CINDY	Then what are we going to do?
BUDDY	You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
CINDY	That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
BUDDY	Let's get a hot dog.

BUDDY	Hey, look out, a bee!
CINDY	Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
BUDDY	That's what your man is supposed to do.

BUDDY	Hey, wanna' share a soda?
CINDY	Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
BUDDY	Yeah.  Can I borrow five bucks?

CINDY	What should we get?
BUDDY	I don't care. You pick.
CINDY	Hot dogs.

THEO	Are you okay?
CINDY	I think so.
THEO	Come on. We better get you cleaned up.

THEO	No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
CINDY	What, you think I did this to myself?

THEO	Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
CINDY	Thanks, I'll be fine.

CINDY	Okay, I get the point.
THEO	So, whatever happened to her?
CINDY	She killed herself a week before he died.

THEO	Let her go, Cin.
CINDY	But he'll kill her!
THEO	That means more screen time for us.

CINDY	I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
RAY	It's okay.
CINDY	Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
RAY	It's the sequel.
CINDY	Oh, right.
RAY	Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
CINDY	I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me.

CINDY	How about these buns?
RAY	Yeah, they're so warm and soft.

CINDY	Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
RAY	This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
CINDY	The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
RAY	What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
CINDY	Right behind you.

CINDY	Where's Shorty?
RAY	I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.

CINDY	Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
RAY	Yeah, I broke my fall.

CINDY	Oh my God! I'm here with the...
HANSON	Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.

CINDY	I'm Cindy.
HANSON	I'm Hanson the caretaker.

CINDY	Ummm!! They smell delicious.
HANSON	Thanks. I made them by hand.

CINDY	Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
HANSON	No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.

CINDY	Hanson, please.
HANSON	Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.

CINDY	Stop touching his brain!
HANSON	Um, I'm not touching anything.

HANSON	Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
CINDY	Not in a thousand years.

CINDY	Stop! --
HANSON	Made you say it!

CINDY	It was you...
HANSON	Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
CINDY	Both of them?
HANSON	Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
CINDY	This can't be happening?
HANSON	Now you'll be mine, Cindy.

CINDY	Noooo!!!
HANSON	Yes!!!!

CINDY	Would you like me to help you pass them back?
DWIGHT	I don't need your help.

DWIGHT	What the hell are you doing?
CINDY	Just wait, you'll see.

CINDY	He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
DWIGHT	Quick, everyone to the lab.

CINDY	What are we gonna do?
DWIGHT	We have to destroy him.

DWIGHT	Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
CINDY	I'll go.

DWIGHT	Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
CINDY	Alright, let's take a vote...

CINDY	Father!
MCFEELY	My child, you're alive!
CINDY	Yes, we made it!
MCFEELY	We? What do you mean... we?
CINDY	Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
MCFEELY	My child you are the only survivor.
CINDY	No, my friends are right here!

MCFEELY	I'm sorry.
CINDY	Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
MCFEELY	Soon, but first I must bless this house.

CINDY	So, do you think you made it into the class?
SHORTY	I don't know, but I sure hope so.
CINDY	You could use the grade, huh?
SHORTY	Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
CINDY	Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
SHORTY	Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
CINDY	Huh?
SHORTY	Gear. You know, clothing.
CINDY	Oh.
SHORTY	Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.

CINDY	Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
SHORTY	Now you gotta learn the correct slang.

CINDY	Yo! That jacket is tight.
SHORTY	Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
CINDY	Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
SHORTY	Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.

CINDY	Am I cool now?
SHORTY	Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.

SHORTY	Aww, the little bird died.
CINDY	Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
SHORTY	Hey, I got an idea.

CINDY	That was a great idea, Shorty.
SHORTY	I told you it would taste just like chicken.

CINDY	Did you do that?
SHORTY	Uh, uh.
CINDY	You better go get Dwight and the Professor.

CINDY	She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
SHORTY	I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
CINDY	Are you?
SHORTY	That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?

SHORTY	Hey, y'all! What's going on?
CINDY	Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
SHORTY	That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.

CINDY	Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
PROFESSOR	Yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.

CINDY	Professor, what's the history of this house?
PROFESSOR	I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.

PROFESSOR	Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
CINDY	Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.

CINDY	Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
PROFESSOR	It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
CINDY	Got my camera right here.

CINDY	I got it!
PROFESSOR	That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.

CINDY	I'm telling you, it was possessed.
PROFESSOR	Theo, did you see the animal?

PROFESSOR	No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
CINDY	What are you getting at, Professor?
PROFESSOR	Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.

PROFESSOR	Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
CINDY	There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.

CINDY	Got a problem with that?
PROFESSOR	Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?

PROFESSOR	I take it you're not mad at me.
CINDY	I wouldn't go that far.

PROFESSOR	I don't like this, this...
CINDY	Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.

CINDY	I think she's starting to suspect something?
PROFESSOR	Who?

CINDY	Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
PROFESSOR	Saw who?!
CINDY	Don't touch me!!

DWIGHT	I finished all the interviews.
PROFESSOR	Let me see the files.
DWIGHT	They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.

PROFESSOR	Let me help you.
DWIGHT	I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.

DWIGHT	Here you go, Professor.
PROFESSOR	Are these all the subjects?

DWIGHT	Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
PROFESSOR	Any of them hot?

DWIGHT	I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
PROFESSOR	Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
DWIGHT	As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
PROFESSOR	Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
DWIGHT	Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
PROFESSOR	Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
DWIGHT	That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
PROFESSOR	What's this?

PROFESSOR	Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
DWIGHT	They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
PROFESSOR	Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
DWIGHT	How are we going to get them all up there?
PROFESSOR	I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
DWIGHT	And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
PROFESSOR	We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
DWIGHT	In about fifteen minutes.
PROFESSOR	Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.

DWIGHT	I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
PROFESSOR	Right. What about condoms?
DWIGHT	Professor!
PROFESSOR	Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
DWIGHT	Would you please focus?
PROFESSOR	Fine.  What's all this stuff?
DWIGHT	Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.

PROFESSOR	Are those cameras all throughout the house?
DWIGHT	Yes, I thought that it would be best.
PROFESSOR	Even in the bathroom?

PROFESSOR	So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
DWIGHT	That one.
PROFESSOR	After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.

PROFESSOR	I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
DWIGHT	Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.

PROFESSOR	Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
DWIGHT	Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
PROFESSOR	Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?

DWIGHT	My God! Is she dead?
PROFESSOR	No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.

DWIGHT	Professor, I think you should see this.
PROFESSOR	What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
DWIGHT	No, these are the tapes from the living room. Check this out.

DWIGHT	The image there.
PROFESSOR	Are you sure it's not the tape?
DWIGHT	I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
PROFESSOR	Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.

DWIGHT	What the hell?!
PROFESSOR	It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.

DWIGHT	Professor, we need to talk.
PROFESSOR	What is it, Dwight?
DWIGHT	I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
PROFESSOR	What?
DWIGHT	The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
PROFESSOR	That's why we came here, remember?
DWIGHT	Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
PROFESSOR	Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.

DWIGHT	I can do it myself.
PROFESSOR	Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
DWIGHT	The keys. She took the keys.

THEO	Hello Dwight.
DWIGHT	Hi.

THEO	What are you working on?
DWIGHT	Just a little experiment.

THEO	Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
DWIGHT	Well, there's a lot riding on this project.

THEO	The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
DWIGHT	You do.
THEO	That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
DWIGHT	And sexy.
THEO	Of course. So sexy.

THEO	Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
DWIGHT	Just a little Rogaine.

THEO	You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
DWIGHT	That's right.
THEO	What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
DWIGHT	Oh, I couldn't do that.

THEO	She's right. We should stick together.
DWIGHT	Alright. Come on, you guys.

HANSON	Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
DWIGHT	Thanks, handyman.
HANSON	I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.

HANSON	Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
DWIGHT	Yours, or the turkeys?
HANSON	I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
DWIGHT	That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.

DWIGHT	It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
RAY	Second best.

RAY	You never could feel your legs.
DWIGHT	What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.

DWIGHT	Alright... I might need your help.
RAY	My help?
DWIGHT	A little bit... Give me your belt.
RAY	I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
DWIGHT	Okay, give me my belt.

RAY	You're not wearing a belt.
DWIGHT	Alright, go to the belt store...

RAY	You mean to tell me we're dead!
DWIGHT	I guess so.

FATHER MCFEELY	Uh... I'm Father McFeely
MOTHER	Father, come in, please.

MOTHER	I'm so glad you're here.
FATHER MCFEELY	I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
MOTHER	It's okay. I understand.
FATHER MCFEELY	How is she?
MOTHER	She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
FATHER MCFEELY	Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.

HARRIS	Father.
FATHER MCFEELY	Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.

HARRIS	Would you like to see the girl?
FATHER MCFEELY	Soon. First, I must bless this house.

HARRIS	Father, are you okay?
FATHER MCFEELY	Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
HARRIS	Yes.
FATHER MCFEELY	Then let us prepare.

FATHER MCFEELY	Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
HARRIS	Because she will lie?
FATHER MCFEELY	No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.

FATHER MCFEELY	Oh shit, you gonna take that?
HARRIS	What?
FATHER MCFEELY	What she said about your mother?

HARRIS	No thanks.
FATHER MCFEELY	My holy water.

HARRIS	Father, I think you should rest.
FATHER MCFEELY	No, I'm fine.

HANSON	Sit down and join us, Cindy.
SHORTY	Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.

HANSON	Now you're being rude, Shorty.
SHORTY	Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.

HANSON	Yo son, check this out.
SHORTY	Dog, you look hot.

SHORTY	Sorry, y'all. My bad.
HANSON	Shorty, why don't you say grace?
SHORTY	Me? Grace? Okay -- Dear God --

HANSON	This part removes the sense of humor.
SHORTY	I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...

RAY	I woke up naked, too.
TOMMY	Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
RAY	What does it say?
TOMMY	It says, "Ray."
RAY	Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
TOMMY	Get out?! What does it say?
RAY	Fucked me.
TOMMY	Aww. Cool. Dude.

TOMMY	Ray!
RAY	Fucked me.
TOMMY	Ray!
RAY	Fucked me.

RAY	Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
TOMMY	I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
RAY	Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
TOMMY	Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
RAY	Don't worry, I got your back.

RALPH	You bet, Bert.
BERT	Good!  I'm gonna be there.

RALPH	Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
BERT	Of course.

RALPH	How's Brad?
BERT	A wreck.
RALPH	Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
BERT	Fools!
RALPH	I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
BERT	Time to check with Flavors.

BERT	Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
RALPH	What's cookin', Bert?
BERT	I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for...

BERT	They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
RALPH	What?
BERT	Nothing.  Just...memories!

MOM	About Brad's family?
BERT	As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.

BERT	You got it!
MOM	I got it!  I got it!!!
BERT	Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.

MOM	Infantile regression.
BERT	You got it!
MOM	I got it!  I got it!!!

BERT	Introduce yourselves.
JANET	I'm Janet Majors and this is my husband Brad.

BERT	We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
JANET	He needs help.

JANET	I know, I know, it's just...
BERT	Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.

BERT	Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
JANET	I've caught it once or twice.
BERT	Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!

JANET	I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
BERT	It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.

JANET	Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
BERT	On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.

BERT	Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
JANET	Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
BERT	Home?

JANET	When do I get to see Brad?
BERT	After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?

BERT	But...how?
JANET	WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS

BERT	SIN-I-FUL
JANET	LITTLE BLACK DRESS

NATION	Dear old Bert's settled everything.
BERT	Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.

NATION	How did you come by this scenario?
BERT	I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
NATION	Why Janet?
BERT	Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
NATION	So it seems.

BERT	In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
NATION	They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.

MAC	Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
BERT	No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
MAC	SPONSOR!!!
BERT	Dentonvale has been sold.
MAC	SOLD??!!

MAC	With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
BERT	Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.

MAC	We're the experts.
BERT	Who trusts experts?

BERT	Out of self comes selflessness.
MAC	Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.

OLIVER	In a way...
BETTY	I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
OLIVER	Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...

BETTY	Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
OLIVER	Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
BETTY	Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
OLIVER	Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
BETTY	Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.

OLIVER	A free thinker.
BETTY	Everything's free there.

BETTY	Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
OLIVER	Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.

OLIVER	McKinley?...McKinley?
BETTY	Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'

BETTY	Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
OLIVER	It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
BETTY	Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
OLIVER	Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...

BETTY	Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
OLIVER	...closed?

BETTY	I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
OLIVER	Now Betty, don't overreact.
BETTY	Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
OLIVER	Yes, Betty.
BETTY	Are you spoken for this evening?

OLIVER	Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
BETTY	It pays to know your way around, Oliver.

OLIVER	A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
BETTY	Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...

BETTY	Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
OLIVER	Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.

BETTY	Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
OLIVER	Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.

OLIVER	Care to indulge?
BETTY	Indulge?
OLIVER	In a little masquerade?

OLIVER	Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
BETTY	He was a President.
OLIVER	President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
BETTY	Really.  What'll I pin this on?
OLIVER	Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.

OLIVER	SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
BETTY	SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT

RALPH	Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
BETTY	Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
RALPH	Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.

RALPH	I'll leave you young things to it.
BETTY	Shove it, Ralph!
RALPH	You too, Betty!

BETTY	Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
RALPH	No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!

JANET	That's us.
BRAD	I don't want to get up there.
JANET	We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.

BRAD	I'm not going, Janet.
JANET	What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
BRAD	But I don't need treadment.

BRAD	I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
JANET	I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE

BRAD	SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
JANET	SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
BRAD	SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY

DAD	YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
MOM	TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`

DAD	Mental instability?
MOM	He was adopted you know.
DAD	I'd forgotten.
MOM	Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'

DAD	What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
MOM	He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.

MOM	Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
DAD	Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
MOM	Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.

MOM	LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
DAD	THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART

NEELY	Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
FARLEY	Sure thing.
NEELY	We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
FARLEY	Absolutely correct.
NEELY	Could you tell us a little about it?
FARLEY	Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
NEELY	And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?

JANET	Could I do that later?
NATION	Of course.

NATION	But they only think they're happy.
JANET	That doesn't make sense.

JANET	I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
NATION	The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
JANET	What do you mean?

NATION	It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
JANET	Who?

JANET	Brad!  Oh, Brad.
NATION	He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.

MOM	Oh my poor baby.
JANET	Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
MOM	I know.

MOM	They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
JANET	It's...
MOM	Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
JANET	What show?

JANET	Poor Brad.
MOM	Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.

MOM	You shouldn't have said that.
JANET	Why?
MOM	Your father doesn't like Mexicans.

JANET	I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
MOM	Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
JANET	Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
MOM	You're practically naked!
JANET	I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.

PARKER	Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
JANET	I'm sorry, Officer.
PARKER	Vance!  Vance Parker.
JANET	Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
PARKER	Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
JANET	Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
PARKER	Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.

JANET	BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
TRIO	OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!

JANET	I NEED SOME
TRIO	YOUNG BLOOD
JANET	I NEED SOME
TRIO	YOUNG BLOOD
JANET	I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
TRIO	YOUNG BLOOD
JANET	I NEED SOME
TRIO	YOUNG BLOOD

JANET	No!  He's never done that before.
MAC	Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.

MAC	Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
JANET	No...couldn't I do this later?

JANET	I'm...happy.
MAC	There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.

MAC	Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
JANET	Me?
MAC	It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...

JANET	I want to see Brad.
MAC	I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.

JANET	Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
MAC	Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.

MAC	You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
JANET	If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
MAC	He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
JANET	Do you really think so?
MAC	You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
JANET	But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
MAC	EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK

JANET	. . .For his own good.
MAC	Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.

MAC	Brad!
JANET	I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...

JANET	BRAD!
MAC	Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
JANET	I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.

TEACHER	Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...

MAC	Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
NATION	We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.

NATION	Our speciality.
MAC	I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!

MAC	HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
NATION	I don't think he intends to go that far.

NATION	Our field.
MAC	What does he know about it?

MAC	It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
NATION	Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?

MAC	That's an extremely negative response.
NATION	Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.

NATION	This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
MAC	And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.

NATION	I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
MAC	YOU'RE NO GOOD

NATION	YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
MAC	YOU'RE NO GOOD

NATION	WHAT A JOKE...
MAC	WHAT A JOKE...
NATION	YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
MAC	YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
NATION	HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
MAC	OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
NATION	YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE

MAC	THAT MINIMAL
NATION	CRIMINAL

MAC	CRIMINAL
NATION	SIN-I-FUL

NATION	This could be worse than the old series.
MAC	In the old series we didn't have a convertible.

MACY	Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
RALPH	Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
MACY	Surely.

MACY	So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
RALPH	...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.

RALPH	THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
MACY	LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
RALPH	THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE

MOM	And none of them worked?
NATION	No.

NATION	And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
MOM	We're not confused.

NATION	Isn't she lovely?
MOM	Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
NATION	She walks in beauty...
MOM	We love you, Baby.
NATION	We all love Janet...Who do we love?

BILLY BOB	Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
MAC	How'd he know I'd come?

BILLY BOB	'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
MAC	Meaning?
BILLY BOB	Hell, he was your grandfather. You know what he did.

BILLY BOB	Maybe you don't want to remember.
MAC	What are you talking about?
BILLY BOB	'Course, it's none of my business.
MAC	Let's say today, we make it your business.

BILLY BOB	You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
MAC	Superstition.
BILLY BOB	Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
MAC	Chicken blood on the crops.
BILLY BOB	...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?

BILLY BOB	I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
KEITH	Oh yeah? Why's that?
BILLY BOB	You're standing in horseshit.

BILLY BOB	Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
KEITH	Alright!
BILLY BOB	Could take a little while, though.
KEITH	What's a "little while?"
BILLY BOB	Two.. maybe three days.

KEITH	Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
BILLY BOB	Nope.
KEITH	See?
BILLY BOB	You were a beat and a quarter behind.
KEITH	Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
BILLY BOB	I ain't never played a banjo in my life.

KEITH	Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
BILLY BOB	Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?

KEITH	Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
BILLY BOB	You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.

CANDY	Get off his case sweetie.
SUZIE	Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
CANDY	Fuck you.
SUZIE	Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!

CANDY	Bitch.
SUZIE	Slut.
CANDY	Witch.
SUZIE	Tramp.

SUZIE	Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
CANDY	Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
SUZIE	Bitch.
CANDY	Bitch.

SUZIE	Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
CANDY	Not according to these.

CANDY	Rod... I have to get back to my job.
SUZIE	Someone actually... employs you?
CANDY	I happen to be a professional.
SUZIE	Which street corner?

SUZIE	Hi.
CANDY	...Hi.
SUZIE	...You any good with those?

CANDY	You have a strong unfufilled desire.
SUZIE	Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
CANDY	No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
SUZIE	The band.

CANDY	Aha. The Lovers.
SUZIE	Not lately.

CANDY	Suzie???
SUZIE	The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!

SUZIE	Looks like the alternator.
CARL	Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
SUZIE	How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
CARL	I didn't do anything --

CARL	Hey, isn't that the preacher?
SUZIE	Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.

SUZIE	Dammit, Carl!!!!
CARL	Sorry.

CARL	There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
SUZIE	No shit.
CARL	I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
SUZIE	You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
CARL	Not someone -- Mac.

SUZIE	Come on --
CARL	Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.

SUZIE	Carl, what are you doing?
CARL	You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.

CARL	AAAAAAAAAAAA --
SUZIE	He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.

JEREMIAH	Gene.
GENE	Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
JEREMIAH	You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
GENE	Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
JEREMIAH	Sounds familiar.
GENE	Book of Jeremiah.

GENE	Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
JEREMIAH	Bus broke down.

GENE	You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
JEREMIAH	Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.

KEITH	Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
IAN	I could. You sucked.
KEITH	Hey. Fuck you.
IAN	Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?

KEITH	Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
IAN	Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.

KEITH	Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
IAN	Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
KEITH	That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
IAN	All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
KEITH	Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
IAN	Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
KEITH	Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.

KEITH	Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
IAN	Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?

IAN	Peggy-Sue --
KEITH	-- "Billy-Jean" --

KEITH	Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
IAN	I thought you said two hundred.

ROD	Curt Cobain.
IAN	Shotgun. Suicide. Next?

IAN	Well, there goes our record deal.
ROD	Nah. We still got Billy Bob.

IAN	You're out of your mind, man.
ROD	I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
IAN	Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?

ROD	The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
IAN	Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?

IAN	Are you crazy?
ROD	Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.

IAN	Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
ROD	Manure... is life.

IAN	So... what does it do?
ROD	It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.

IAN	Should we be doing this, dude?
ROD	Metaphysical question, man.

ROD	Old Macdonald... had --
IAN	-- an AXE!

IAN	With a hack-hack here --
ROD	And a slash-slash there --
IAN	Hi Suze.

IAN	He means moon shining.
ROD	Harvest moonshining!
IAN	Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!

ROD	Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
IAN	He's right. Nice guitar break.

ROD	Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
IAN	Come out, come out wherever you are!

ROD	We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
IAN	The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!

MAC	What are you going to do? Shoot me?
JEREMIAH	Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
MAC	You know who I am. You invited me.

MAC	I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
JEREMIAH	Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
MAC	Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
JEREMIAH	Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.

MAC	I came back for the funeral. That's all.
JEREMIAH	Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.

MAC	I'll be gone again tomorrow.
JEREMIAH	...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.

MAC	How... was she "called?"
JEREMIAH	Pardon?
MAC	Aunt Edith. How did she... die?

JEREMIAH	That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
MAC	This is his room... isn't it?
JEREMIAH	Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
MAC	I'll be fine here.

JEREMIAH	You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
MAC	Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
JEREMIAH	I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
MAC	She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...

JEREMIAH	Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
MAC	Blood?

JEREMIAH	You'll be back.
MAC	I don't think so.

JEREMIAH	You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
MAC	That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
JEREMIAH	Sure. What do you want to know.
MAC	People say he was a murderer.
JEREMIAH	That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.

MAC	Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
JEREMIAH	-- It's not me!
MAC	Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!

JEREMIAH	It's time to make amends.
MAC	Amends...?
JEREMIAH	Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
MAC	I --

RAY	Throw me one.
KAREN	Not while you're driving.

KAREN	-- And keep your eyes on the road.
RAY	I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
KAREN	Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

RAY	Never heard of it.
KAREN	I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
RAY	You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?

KAREN	Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
RAY	Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
KAREN	-- By way of my breasts?

RAY	Ow!
KAREN	What's wrong?
RAY	Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.

RAY	Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
KAREN	Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.

SUZIE	Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
KEITH	Who? Us?!
SUZIE	The audience!

SUZIE	Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
KEITH	Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.

SUZIE	You know what they say about men who need big guns...
KEITH	Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
SUZIE	Down boy.
KEITH	Who you callin' "boy?"

KEITH	Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
SUZIE	You got something against farm people, Keith?
KEITH	Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --

SUZIE	It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
KEITH	He started it.
SUZIE	You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
KEITH	What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!

KEITH	Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
SUZIE	Amen.

KEITH	What the fuck you talking about, man?
SUZIE	He's right. You were behind.

KEITH	Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
ROD	Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
KEITH	Chicken sandwich?
ROD	Bzzzzzzzzzt!
KEITH	Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?

KEITH	You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
ROD	Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.

KEITH	Shit!
MAC	Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
KEITH	Yes!
MAC	Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.

MAC	Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
KEITH	Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".

KEITH	Yeah. That's just the problem.
MAC	Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.

MAC	You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
KEITH	Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.

MAC	How does it feel, Keith?
KEITH	Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
MAC	Is that right?
KEITH	Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.

MAC	Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
SUZIE	Yeah?
MAC	-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.

SUZIE	You never told us you grew up on a farm.
MAC	Nothing to tell.

MAC	My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
SUZIE	About what?
MAC	Name something.
SUZIE	Then why go back now?
MAC	Still trying to figure it out myself.

SUZIE	What about Jeremiah?
MAC	Nah. Just you.

SUZIE	What's wrong?
MAC	This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
SUZIE	So?
MAC	When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...

SUZIE	I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
MAC	Let it go.
SUZIE	I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.

SUZIE	Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
MAC	I said that's enough!

SUZIE	We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
MAC	I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.

SUZIE	How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
MAC	Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
SUZIE	Getting ready.
MAC	Look. You want to talk about this?
SUZIE	I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.

MAC	Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
SUZIE	Mmmm -- so can I...

MAC	You wouldn't understand.
SUZIE	You never had trouble communicating before.

MAC	Suzie --
SUZIE	Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
MAC	Wait a minute --
SUZIE	I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
MAC	What are --
SUZIE	HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
MAC	-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?

SUZIE	You're... limping.
MAC	I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.

MAC	Suzie... No.
SUZIE	It's you. You and your father.
MAC	No --
SUZIE	You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
MAC	Listen to me --
SUZIE	You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
MAC	Suzie --

SUZIE	No Mac, please... I --
MAC	Don't look.

SUZIE	Mac... let's get out of here.
MAC	Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.

MAC	Get out of here.
SUZIE	No. Not without you --

MAC	The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
SUZIE	You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...

SUZIE	...no... Mac... p-please...
MAC	Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...

SUZIE	I almost thought for a second...
MAC	Never.

SUZIE	Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
ROD	I was getting 'warmed' up.

ROD	Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
SUZIE	Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --

ROD	What is it?!!
SUZIE	Spider.

ROD	She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
SUZIE	What a surprise. -- What about our audition?

SUZIE	Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
ROD	Like what?
SUZIE	Like your guitar break.
ROD	It's coming right up. After the third verse.
SUZIE	Second verse!
ROD	Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.

SUZIE	-- Where have you two been?
ROD	Us? We been... moonlighting.

ROD	Where's Mac?
SUZIE	Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.

SUZIE	Carl.
ROD	CARL??? Carl did this?!!
SUZIE	Last night... he tried to get it on with me.

ROD	Someone better tell Mac.
SUZIE	Why bother?

ROD	It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
SUZIE	What'll we do?

MARCEL	Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
AMY	I'd use pills. They're painless.
MARCEL	Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?

MARCEL	Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
AMY	Exactly.

MARCEL	Merde! Just missed!
AMY	Uhh! Would you die already!

AMY	Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
MARCEL	Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...

AMY	Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
MARCEL	Just like sex with my wife.
AMY	The key is don't look down.
MARCEL	Also like sex with my wife.
AMY	Would you shut up?

MARCEL	Tell you what, we'll jump together.
AMY	Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...

MARCEL	Merde! I can't believe this!
AMY	You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.

AMY	I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
MARCEL	Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...

MARCEL	Either way works for us...
AMY	But you better hurry.

AMY	Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
ANDY	What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.

AMY	God. How can you eat like that?
ANDY	It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?

AMY	Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
ANDY	Yeah. Apparently.

AMY	Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
ANDY	Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
AMY	Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
ANDY	Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
AMY	Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
ANDY	Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
AMY	I don't know... Surprise me.

AMY	Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
ANDY	AHHHHHHH!

AMY	Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
ANDY	Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!

AMY	Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
ANDY	No it isn't! You're dead!

ANDY	Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
AMY	A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
ANDY	Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?

ANDY	Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
AMY	Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.

ANDY	Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
AMY	What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?

ANDY	Ha-ha!
AMY	Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!

SERAFINE	Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
ANDY	Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
SERAFINE	Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
ANDY	You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.

ANDY	Sure. I can follow that.
SERAFINE	It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
ANDY	Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
SERAFINE	Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
ANDY	Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?

SERAFINE	Salots! Shitfucker!
ANDY	What?
SERAFINE	If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.

SERAFINE	You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
ANDY	Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
SERAFINE	You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
ANDY	Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
SERAFINE	Uh-huh. Good for you.

ANDY	Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
SERAFINE	It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
ANDY	Like an underground club?
SERAFINE	Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
ANDY	And who's Claude?

SERAFINE	Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
ANDY	In an underground club? I'd like to see that.

SERAFINE	I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
ANDY	Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.

SERAFINE	What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
ANDY	Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.

ANDY	Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
SERAFINE	Andy!

ANDY	So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
SERAFINE	You must get out of here. It's not safe.

SERAFINE	Andy! Holy shit!
ANDY	Serafine...?

SERAFINE	Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
ANDY	Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...

SERAFINE	What happened? Did you cut yourself?
ANDY	Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.

SERAFINE	You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
ANDY	I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
SERAFINE	So... you feel okay now?

SERAFINE	Fan-fucking-tastic?
ANDY	Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.

ANDY	Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
SERAFINE	Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
ANDY	I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!

ANDY	What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
SERAFINE	Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.

SERAFINE	What about your glasses?
ANDY	It's okay. I can see fine.

SERAFINE	Don't you want to change?
ANDY	Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!

SERAFINE	Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
ANDY	So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?

ANDY	Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
SERAFINE	So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
ANDY	That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
SERAFINE	A la votre.

ANDY	This looks familiar...
SERAFINE	Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.

ANDY	Serafine...
SERAFINE	I'll be right back. Stay put.

ANDY	Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
SERAFINE	Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
ANDY	Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.

ANDY	Hello?
SERAFINE	Are you okay?
ANDY	No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
SERAFINE	Where did you go last night? What did you do?
ANDY	I don't... I... I can't remember...
SERAFINE	Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.

ANDY	I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
SERAFINE	I know. He told me.
ANDY	What?! He told you? When?

ANDY	You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
SERAFINE	Andy! No!

SERAFINE	Because, Andy. It's a cure.
ANDY	A cure?

SERAFINE	Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
ANDY	I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.

SERAFINE	What makes you so sure this will work?
ANDY	I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
SERAFINE	I don't know...
ANDY	Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
SERAFINE	I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.

SERAFINE	They're coming!
ANDY	Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.

ANDY	I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
SERAFINE	I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
ANDY	Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.

SERAFINE	Are you crazy!?
ANDY	Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.

ANDY	What the fuck!? You too!?
SERAFINE	I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...

SERAFINE	I hope they fucking fry us all.
ANDY	Yeah. French fries...

SERAFINE	Holy mother of God...
ANDY	Fuck me...

SERAFINE	Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
ANDY	It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
SERAFINE	No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
ANDY	That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!

SERAFINE	You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
ANDY	What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
SERAFINE	Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?

SERAFINE	Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
ANDY	What...?
SERAFINE	You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!

SERAFINE	We don't both have to die.
ANDY	I couldn't do it. Not to you.

SERAFINE	We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
ANDY	No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?

SERAFINE	I know where he'll go.
ANDY	Where?
SERAFINE	Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.

ANDY	Didn't even have to ask.
SERAFINE	All your weapons, on the floor! Now!

SERAFINE	No wonder he let her go.
ANDY	Really.

ANDY	God. I can't believe it.
SERAFINE	What?
ANDY	It's making me hungry.

ANDY	What does it say?
SERAFINE	Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead.

ANDY	Whoa...
SERAFINE	After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
ANDY	Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
SERAFINE	Well, they are French.
ANDY	Right.

ANDY	These tunnels must loop around and connect.
SERAFINE	Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.

ANDY	Okay. Be careful.
SERAFINE	You too.

ANDY	Oh God. Shit...
SERAFINE	Andy...

COP	Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
ANDY	FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!

ANDY	GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
COP	Fuck? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?

COP	Okay, what the hell are you up to?
ANDY	It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!

ANDY	There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
COP	You on drugs? Huh?
ANDY	No... I...

COP	Pull over! Now!
ANDY	Shit!

COP	It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
ANDY	Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
COP	Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -

GASTON	In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
ANDY	Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...

GASTON	Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
ANDY	Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
GASTON	Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
ANDY	My uncle's in a coma you moron!
GASTON	Before the coma!
ANDY	He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...

GASTON	Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
ANDY	Or else what? You'll kill me?
GASTON	No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
ANDY	You'll never get the chance.

GASTON	Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
ANDY	Bullshit! You're bluffing!
GASTON	What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?

ANDY	Claude...?
GASTON	And you call me a moron...

GASTON	The ADM. Let's go.
ANDY	Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.

ANDY	So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
GASTON	If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?

GASTON	What's the problem?
ANDY	Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?

GASTON	Do you think I'm an idiot?
ANDY	Sure. Don't you?

GASTON	Another step and he's dead!
ANDY	Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.

ANDY	You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
GASTON	Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!

ANDY	Ha. Some wonder drug...
GASTON	Why isn't it doing anything!?

GASTON	Nothing's happening!
ANDY	Looks like he lied to you too.

LEDUC	You recognize her?
ANDY	What?!

LEDUC	We know you were with her.
ANDY	Oh shit... No...
LEDUC	That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
ANDY	Oh no... no....

LEDUC	He was a good man. Now his wife is a widow.
ANDY	This is... it's like a sick joke, I -

LEDUC	Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
ANDY	But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
LEDUC	I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.

LEDUC	I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
ANDY	What about me?
LEDUC	My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...

CLAUDE	I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
ANDY	I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.

CLAUDE	It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
ANDY	Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
CLAUDE	The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.

ANDY	Psychic awareness. Right.
CLAUDE	You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
ANDY	What?
CLAUDE	He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
ANDY	Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?

CLAUDE	Andy...
ANDY	Yeah?
CLAUDE	Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.

CLAUDE	You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
ANDY	Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.

ANDY	Not you too -
CLAUDE	My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.

CLAUDE	You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
ANDY	Why the fuck would I do that?

CLAUDE	Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed.  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
ANDY	Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...

CLAUDE	I don't believe we've been introduced.
ANDY	What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 

ANDY	Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
CLAUDE	It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
ANDY	Uncle Terrence.
CLAUDE	Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
ANDY	Because Gaston was after it.
CLAUDE	Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.

ANDY	Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
CLAUDE	That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.

ANDY	It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
CLAUDE	I told him it wasn't ready...

CLAUDE	All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
ANDY	You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?

ANDY	Uncle Terrence?
TERRENCE	Andy? Andy is that you?
ANDY	Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -

TERRENCE	Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
ANDY	Sort of...

TERRENCE	Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
ANDY	Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
TERRENCE	The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
ANDY	I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -

TERRENCE	Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
ANDY	The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!

ANDY	Where is it! Please!
TERRENCE	AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!

ANDY	Uncle Terrence, you're...
TERRENCE	Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
ANDY	Claude.
TERRENCE	I never thought I'd ask this of anyone, Andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?

MARCEL	Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
ANDY	That's McDermott, but yeah.

MARCEL	He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
ANDY	Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?

ANDY	Jesus...
MARCEL	How well did, er, do you know him?
ANDY	Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
MARCEL	No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
ANDY	Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
MARCEL	Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
ANDY	What do you mean, maniacs?
MARCEL	Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
ANDY	Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.

MARCEL	Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
ANDY	I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
MARCEL	Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.

ANDY	Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
MARCEL	Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
ANDY	Why would he pick this one?
MARCEL	I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
ANDY	Not that I know.
MARCEL	Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.

MARCEL	I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
ANDY	Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
MARCEL	What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?

ANDY	Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
MARCEL	No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!

ANDY	Alright. Let me write a letter.
MARCEL	Good man. Now can I have my arms back?

ANDY	What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
MARCEL	But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.

ANDY	Shit. I feel sick.
MARCEL	Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
ANDY	Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.

MARCEL	Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
ANDY	Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?

CHIEF	Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
LEDUC	I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
CHIEF	Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
LEDUC	I told you. These murders are not normal.

CHIEF	Enough. Cut him loose.
LEDUC	I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
CHIEF	Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.

SERAFINE	Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
CLAUDE	Allo?

SERAFINE	Andy!
CLAUDE	Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
SERAFINE	Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
CLAUDE	God, well don't let him go! Catch him!

CLAUDE	No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
SERAFINE	You fucking liar!
CLAUDE	Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.

LEDUC	What've you got?
DESK OFFICER	Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
LEDUC	What did she say?
DESK OFFICER	Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
LEDUC	I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
DESK OFFICER	But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
LEDUC	Now!
DESK OFFICER	Yes sir.

LEDUC	Merde.
MARCEL	He says -

LEDUC	Here.
MARCEL	Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?

LEDUC	Well?
MARCEL	Okay. So maybe you were right.
LEDUC	Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.

LEDUC	Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
MARCEL	Merde.

LEDUC	Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
MARCEL	Double merde.

LEDUC	You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
MARCEL	Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.

MARCEL	Saint Severin...
LEDUC	You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
MARCEL	You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
LEDUC	What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?

DAVID	Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
ALISON	Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.

ALISON	Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
DAVID	Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
ALISON	Yeeees?
DAVID	And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
ALISON	There aren't hotels?
DAVID	Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
ALISON	And what did you say?
DAVID	I said I'd check with you.

ALISON	Do we know anything about him?
DAVID	Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
ALISON	David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
DAVID	Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.

ALISON	It's the last thing we need.
DAVID	That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."

ALISON	Scottish.
DAVID	Tom Jones?

DAVID	Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
ALISON	Did you really ask?
DAVID	I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
ALISON	What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.

ALISON	It isn't working any more, David.
DAVID	I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.

DAVID	Jesus.
ALISON	I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.

ALISON	Go ahead.
DAVID	I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.

ALISON	There were three strawberries.
DAVID	One.

ALISON	Liar.
DAVID	0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.

DAVID	Ali?  What's wrong?
ALISON	Your face smells like a foot.

ALISON	Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
DAVID	It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.

DAVID	Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
ALISON	David, I'm serious!
DAVID	I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
ALISON	Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?

DAVID	Hi,
ALISON	Hi.....  Roses.
ALISON	Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
DAVID	Sort of half.....
ALISON	Meaning?
DAVID	I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
ALISON	Honestly David, you're so spineless.

ALISON	At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
DAVID	Ah, well .... CUT TO:

ALISON	0 my god.
DAVID	Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
ALISON	Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?

ALISON	Let's get a coffee.
DAVID	Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.

DAVID	Everything's gonna be fine.
ALISON	About Charles...

DAVID	shhh...
ALISON	It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
DAVID	I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. Olympic standard.

ALISON	Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
DAVID	Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.

DAVID	Here, let me do that.
ALISON	No, I'm fine.

ALISON	He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
DAVID	I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.

ANNIE	Two dollars please.
DAVID	Annie, it's me.
ANNIE	Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
DAVID	No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.

ANNIE	He doesn't like to say much does he?
DAVID	Right first time.
ANNIE	I can understand THAT. Neither do I.

ANNIE	Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
DAVID	Thanks, Annie.

DAVID	Goodnight Annie.
ANNIE	Night.

ANNIE	Big day today, huh? 78
DAVID	Uh ... yes ...

ANNIE	David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
DAVID	Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.

DAVID	Ah, Mr Bean ...
BEAN	Excuse me.

DAVID	Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
BEAN	Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...

DAVID	Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
BEAN	Ahm.....
DAVID	What?  What?

DAVID	Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
BEAN	oh dear.
DAVID	What happened?!!!
BEAN	Ahm.... .

BEAN	Oh yes.
DAVID	Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....

DAVID	It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
BEAN	Well, Ahm....

DAVID	It's very good Bernie.
BERNIE	But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.

BERNIE	I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
DAVID	Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
BERNIE	Howls he getting on with the family?
DAVID	Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.

BERNIE	And howls Alison?
DAVID	She's ... well, she's good.
BERNIE	Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
DAVID	Yes, isn't he.
BERNIE	It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
DAVID	Isn't it?

DAVID	Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
BERNIE	Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.

DAVID	'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
BERNIE	Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.

BERNIE	Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
DAVID	Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
BERNIE	You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. .  Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.

BERNIE	Everything okay, David?
DAVID	Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
BERNIE	He's just parking the Governor's car.
DAVID	Great - keep him out of trouble.

DAVID	Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
BERNIE	I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...

GRIERSON	Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
BERNIE	Great news.

GRIERSON	So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
BERNIE	Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
GRIERSON	David?

BERNIE	We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
GRIERSON	Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.

GRIERSON	What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
BERNIE	And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
GRIERSON	Right.  Got it.

GRIERSON	This is Elmer, our longest serving...
BERNIE	Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.

BERNIE	Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
GRIERSON	Thank you Bernie.  Well done.  Now, If you'll excuse - I have a little smartening up to do myself.

GRIERSON	He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
BERNIE	Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
GRIERSON	Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask, survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?  Well, the truth is - we can't.  So what am I saying?  Will we find her again?  Never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.

DAVID	Say that again, son.
DOCTOR	I beg your pardon?
DAVID	I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
DOCTOR	I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
DAVID	We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.

DAVID	So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
DOCTOR	Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.

DAVID	Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
GRIERSON	I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
DAVID	on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?

GRIERSON	Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
DAVID	No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:

GRIERSON	Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
DAVID	Yes, this is Doctor Bean.

DAVID	Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
GRIERSON	Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
DAVID	Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
GRIERSON	Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
DAVID	You're not going to ....
GRIERSON	Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?

DAVID	No!
GRIERSON	Er ... pray tell me why?

DAVID	The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
GRIERSON	Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
DAVID	Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?

GRIERSON	Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
DAVID	... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
GRIERSON	No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.

GRIERSON	Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
DAVID	Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.

GRIERSON	I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
DAVID	Ahm....
GRIERSON	Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
DAVID	Quite right, sir.

GRIERSON	Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
DAVID	Certainly is.

GRIERSON	David, David, David ...
DAVID	I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
GRIERSON	Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.

GRIERSON	I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
DAVID	VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

GRIERSON	Of course.
DAVID	And a car.
GRIERSON	Mmmmm...

DAVID	Maybe two cars.
GRIERSON	A car sounds sensible.
DAVID	And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.

JENNIFER	Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  All Englishmen are ugly.
DAVID	What makes you say that?
JENNIFER	All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
DAVID	Richard Burton was very good-looking.
JENNIFER	Welsh.
DAVID	Sean Connery.

JENNIFER	Welsh again.
DAVID	Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.

DAVID	Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
JENNIFER	There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...

DAVID	Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
JENNIFER	It's you and Mom that need to talk.
DAVID	Sure.  You're right.

JENNIFER	Bye, Dad.
DAVID	Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?

DAVID	As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
ELMER	Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.

DAVID	You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
ELMER	Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.

DAVID	You arrange those flowers yourself?
ELMER	Sure did.
DAVID	They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
ELMER	No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

KEVIN	Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
DAVID	Great, good.

KEVIN	Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
DAVID	Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
KEVIN	I vote for Bart.

DAVID	He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
KEVIN	That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
DAVID	Well, there is that ...
KEVIN	I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?

KEVIN	Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
DAVID	Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.

KEVIN	Is Jenny gonna be okay?
DAVID	She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
KEVIN	But is she gonna be okay?
DAVID	How the hell should I know?

KEVIN	... in the distant future.
DAVID	Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.

NURSE	Doctor Jacobson?
DOCTOR JACOBSON	Yes?
NURSE	We need you urgently in C Theatre.
DOCTOR JACOBSON	Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
NURSE	It is urgent, sir.
DOCTOR JACOBSON	Okay.....

GRIERSON	what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
REYNOLDS	Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
GRIERSON	Not at all, Governor.  Very striking.

REYNOLDS	Interesting suit.
GRIERSON	Why thank you sir.
REYNOLDS	off the peg?
GRIERSON	Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

REYNOLDS	I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
GRIERSON	I am sorry you feel that way.
REYNOLDS	And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.

JENNIFER	Shut up, Kevin.
KEVIN	NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
JENNIFER	You know the thing I hate most about children?
KEVIN	Nope.
JENNIFER	You.

KEVIN	I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
JENNIFER	It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.

KEVIN	You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
JENNIFER	Of course he is.
KEVIN	Are you?

JENNIFER	Come on Sting!
KEVIN	Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.

AMILYN	I don't think this is gold.
LOTHOS	Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.

LOTHOS	What's wrong with you!?!
AMILYN	My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
LOTHOS	Shut up!  You let him have it!

LOTHOS	You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
AMILYN	I had him in my grasp.
LOTHOS	Cheer up.  You may still.

AMILYN	I look horrible.
LOTHOS	The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
AMILYN	I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
LOTHOS	No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.

ANDY	I like it.  Can I be your friend?
JEFFREY	Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'

JEFFREY	Well, um... litter?
ANDY	Litter, yeah!

ANDY	... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
JEFFREY	I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
ANDY	Coach knows what abs are?

ANDY	Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
JEFFREY	What's with you?

JEFFREY	Nice to feel needed.
ANDY	Let's move out!
JEFFREY	Yes!

BUFFY	Nice game.
ANDY	Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
BUFFY	Andy!

ANDY	Man has a complex.
BUFFY	He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.

BUFFY	Don't grab me, okay?
ANDY	Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.

ANDY	Buffy!  Looking tasty.
BUFFY	Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?

ANDY	Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
BUFFY	Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.

PIKE	Booo!
BENNY	Suck!
PIKE	Wrong answer!  No prize.

PIKE	No, we didn't.
BENNY	Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.

PIKE	Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
BENNY	That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
PIKE	We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...

PIKE	It's coffee.
BENNY	Amazing!

BENNY	Figures.
PIKE	Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.

BENNY	You're the guys from the movie!
PIKE	We hate you guys!

BENNY	Hey!  She wasted my dog!
PIKE	Bummer metaphor.

BENNY	Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
PIKE	You didn't like them.
BENNY	They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
PIKE	Would you sleep with them?
BENNY	Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
PIKE	Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
BENNY	I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
PIKE	Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.

BENNY	When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
PIKE	You think?  Split?
BENNY	Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
PIKE	Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.

PIKE	Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
BENNY	Let me in.
PIKE	Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --

BENNY	Invite me in, Pike.
PIKE	Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
BENNY	I'm fine.
PIKE	You look like shit, Benny.

BENNY	I... feel.... pretty.
PIKE	No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
BENNY	The sun!  It burns!  It burns!

BENNY	Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
PIKE	Get away from here.
BENNY	I'm hungry.
PIKE	I mean it.

MERRICK	Did you see a girl come by here?
BIKER	You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
MERRICK	Yes.
BIKER	Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
MERRICK	Wheels?
BIKER	My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
MERRICK	Which way did she go?
BIKER	Down there.

JENNIFER	Excellent.
BUFFY	What's playing there?

JENNIFER	Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
BUFFY	Yeah, I guess.
JENNIFER	My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.

JENNIFER	Oh, my God.  Is that true?
BUFFY	Probably.  What movie is this?

JENNIFER	Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
BUFFY	Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.

JENNIFER	Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
BUFFY	Don't tread on the earth?

BUFFY	Dying.
JENNIFER	Eeyuu.

JENNIFER	Hi, Buffy.
BUFFY	Hi, guys.

JENNIFER	He doesn't look fifty.
BUFFY	Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.

BUFFY'S MOM	Do you know what time it is?
BUFFY	Uum... around ten?

BUFFY'S MOM	Buffy, honey?
BUFFY	Yeah?
BUFFY'S MOM	Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
BUFFY	Maybe.
BUFFY'S MOM	What's Bobby gonna say?
BUFFY	I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
BUFFY'S MOM	Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.

JEFFREY	You okay?
BUFFY	I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.

BUFFY	Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
JEFFREY	Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
BUFFY	Something like that.
JEFFREY	Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...

BUFFY	What show is this?
JEFFREY	It's the news, Buffy.
BUFFY	Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
JEFFREY	I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
BUFFY	Mmmnkay.

BUFFY	Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
JEFFREY	You were having a nightmare.

JEFFREY	What'd you dream about?
BUFFY	Nothing.
JEFFREY	Come on, what was it?
BUFFY	Nothing.  It was just a dream.

JEFFREY	Hey there.
BUFFY	Hi.

JEFFREY	Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
BUFFY	Jealous?

JEFFREY	Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
BUFFY	I do?  I guess I do.
JEFFREY	Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
BUFFY	I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.

JEFFREY	I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
BUFFY	'Bye.

BUFFY	I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY	So I noticed.

JEFFREY	So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
BUFFY	Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.

JEFFREY	Buffy, what are you doing here?
BUFFY	I thought we were meeting here.
JEFFREY	I'm here with Jenny.

BUFFY	I don't understand.
JEFFREY	Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
BUFFY	No, you didn't.  When?
JEFFREY	Didn't you get my message?
BUFFY	You broke up with my machine?
JEFFREY	You weren't home.  Like always.
BUFFY	You left me a message?
JEFFREY	I'm out of here.  Jenny.

LOTHOS	Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
BUFFY	Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
LOTHOS	What?

LOTHOS	You're even weaker than the others.
BUFFY	I think you've forgotten something.

LOTHOS	This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
BUFFY	No...

LOTHOS	I am a God!  A God!
BUFFY	I am so sure.

PIKE	Will you guys shut up, please?
BUFFY	It could happen.

PIKE	Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
BUFFY	You guys are thrashed.

PIKE	Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
BUFFY	Buffy.

BUFFY	Hi.
PIKE	Hi there.
BUFFY	Is that your car?
PIKE	It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --

BUFFY	How are you doing?
PIKE	Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
BUFFY	You want some water or something?
PIKE	Water.  Okay.

PIKE	Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
BUFFY	Not exactly.
PIKE	They were vampires, weren't they?
BUFFY	Yeah.
PIKE	God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.

BUFFY	You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
PIKE	Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
BUFFY	Well, stay here tonight.
PIKE	Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
BUFFY	Where are you gonna go?
PIKE	Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.

PIKE	Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
BUFFY	It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.

BUFFY	Things are kind of confusing.
PIKE	I'll back that up.
BUFFY	Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
PIKE	I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
BUFFY	It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
PIKE	No, you're not.

BUFFY	I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
PIKE	I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
BUFFY	You sure?
PIKE	Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
BUFFY	Mmkay.

PIKE	Hey, Buffy...
BUFFY	Yeah?
PIKE	You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.

BUFFY	I didn't expect to see you.
PIKE	I know.
BUFFY	Why'd you come back?
PIKE	I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
BUFFY	Thanks.
PIKE	Besides, Oxnard sucks.

BUFFY	Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
PIKE	I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?

PIKE	Buffy?  What's wrong?
BUFFY	Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
PIKE	Who?
BUFFY	Merrick...

PIKE	I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
BUFFY	I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
PIKE	Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
BUFFY	A dress.
PIKE	Dress, huh?  What for?
BUFFY	For the dance.
PIKE	Come again?
BUFFY	I'm going to the senior dance.
PIKE	Second word... sound like 'dance'.

BUFFY	I'm going to the dance.
PIKE	What for?
BUFFY	In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
PIKE	I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
BUFFY	It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
PIKE	You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
BUFFY	I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
PIKE	Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
BUFFY	He did what he was supposed to.
PIKE	But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
BUFFY	Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
PIKE	I should have known.

BUFFY	Leave me alone.
PIKE	Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.

PIKE	I crashed your party.
BUFFY	Pretty shallow of you.
PIKE	That's me.
BUFFY	I'm glad you came.
PIKE	Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.

PIKE	Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
BUFFY	I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.

BUFFY	I'm going out the front.
PIKE	Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
BUFFY	You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
PIKE	You say that like it's a bad thing.

BUFFY	Good thing one of us was prepared.
PIKE	Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.

PIKE	Are you okay?
BUFFY	Get away from me!

PIKE	I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
BUFFY	Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
PIKE	Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
BUFFY	We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
PIKE	You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.

BUFFY	It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
CASSANDRA	'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'

CASSANDRA	It is a pretty crucial subject.
BUFFY	See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend.

BUFFY	Bugs.
CASSANDRA	Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?

CASSANDRA	Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
BUFFY	Bogutude.  Blow it off.
CASSANDRA	I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
BUFFY	You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
CASSANDRA	Like what?
BUFFY	Like my homework.

KIMBERLY	Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
BUFFY	) What do you think?
KIMBERLY	Please.  It's so '91.

KIMBERLY	What are we doing?
BUFFY	Why don't we see a movie?
KIMBERLY	Well, where?

KIMBERLY	Beverly Center.
BUFFY	Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.

KIMBERLY	Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
BUFFY	Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.

BUFFY	Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
KIMBERLY	Nice ensemble!

KIMBERLY	What did Jeffrey's dad say?
BUFFY	'Just remember you're in training, son'

KIMBERLY	Let's meet tonight, okay?
BUFFY	Where?
KIMBERLY	Cafe Blase.

KIMBERLY	I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
BUFFY	Kimberly, it's the senior dance.

BUFFY	I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
KIMBERLY	Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
BUFFY	Get a boob job.

KIMBERLY	You were supposed to be here at three.
BUFFY	I forgot.
KIMBERLY	Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
BUFFY	Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
KIMBERLY	Oh my God you're having an affair.

BUFFY	Excuse me for having something important to do.
KIMBERLY	This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
BUFFY	Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.

BUFFY	Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
KIMBERLY	Get out of my facial.

BUFFY	I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
KIMBERLY	Yeah, whoops I came.
BUFFY	You look way pretty, Kim.
KIMBERLY	I know.  I like your little outfit.

BUFFY	God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
MERRICK	I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.

BUFFY	What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
MERRICK	I'm looking for you, actually.
BUFFY	Am I in trouble or something?
MERRICK	Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
BUFFY	What are you talking about?
MERRICK	I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
BUFFY	Why?
MERRICK	To bring you... your birthright.
BUFFY	My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?

BUFFY	I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
MERRICK	You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
BUFFY	Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
MERRICK	Wait!
BUFFY	You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
MERRICK	You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
BUFFY	Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
MERRICK	You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
BUFFY	Time to do what?
MERRICK	To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
BUFFY	Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
MERRICK	Yes.
BUFFY	Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
MERRICK	I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.

BUFFY	Just stay away from me, okay?
MERRICK	Did you ever dream that you were someone else?

BUFFY	Everybody does.
MERRICK	In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.

BUFFY	I was a slave.
MERRICK	In Virginia.
BUFFY	I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
MERRICK	China.
BUFFY	Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.

BUFFY	I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
MERRICK	Lothos.

BUFFY	How do you know all this?
MERRICK	I have to show you.

BUFFY	I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
MERRICK	Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
BUFFY	Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.

BUFFY	Ow.
MERRICK	Cramps?
BUFFY	None of your business.  God.
MERRICK	This is it.

BUFFY	Wait a minute.
MERRICK	Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
BUFFY	All right.  What do we do now?
MERRICK	We wait for Robert to wake up.

MERRICK	Where's the other one?
BUFFY	She --

MERRICK	Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
BUFFY	All right.

MERRICK	Meet me at this address after school.
BUFFY	I have cheerleading squad.
MERRICK	Skip it.

BUFFY	They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
MERRICK	It's true.

MERRICK	It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
BUFFY	Our purposes.

BUFFY	What, um...  What do we do?
MERRICK	There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
BUFFY	Why do you keep saying that?
MERRICK	Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
BUFFY	A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
MERRICK	Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
BUFFY	Oh, him.
MERRICK	Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
BUFFY	What?
MERRICK	We'll cover it later.
BUFFY	I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
MERRICK	In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
BUFFY	Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
MERRICK	We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.

BUFFY	Not a pressing issue.
MERRICK	I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
BUFFY	Uh... gym.
MERRICK	Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
BUFFY	Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
MERRICK	But you enjoyed it, yes?
BUFFY	Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
MERRICK	Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
BUFFY	Sporting events, yeah.
MERRICK	All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
BUFFY	Here?
MERRICK	Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
BUFFY	Okay.

BUFFY	Who we gonna beat?
MERRICK	Who we gonna beat?
BUFFY	No -- you don't have to --
MERRICK	Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
BUFFY	No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
MERRICK	Oh.  Good.

BUFFY	Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
MERRICK	I had to test you.
BUFFY	But you threw a knife at my head!
MERRICK	And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
BUFFY	I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!

MERRICK	It was necessary.
BUFFY	Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
MERRICK	I don't think you understand the full implications of --

BUFFY	Oh.  Sorry.
MERRICK	Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
BUFFY	Put your head back.
MERRICK	Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
BUFFY	No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
MERRICK	Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.

BUFFY	Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
MERRICK	Your turn.

BUFFY	What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
MERRICK	No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
BUFFY	Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
MERRICK	Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
BUFFY	If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
MERRICK	Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
BUFFY	My nails.

MERRICK	All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
BUFFY	They were vampires?
MERRICK	Same one.
BUFFY	Oh.

BUFFY	What!?!
MERRICK	Try to pay attention.

MERRICK	He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
BUFFY	Fine.
MERRICK	And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
BUFFY	Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
MERRICK	You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.

BUFFY	Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
MERRICK	It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
BUFFY	Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
MERRICK	You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
BUFFY	You are such a wet.
MERRICK	A what?
BUFFY	A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
MERRICK	Don't start with me again.
BUFFY	Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
MERRICK	Buffy...
BUFFY	And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
MERRICK	What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
BUFFY	Oh, fuck you!

MERRICK	Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
BUFFY	I...
MERRICK	What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?

BUFFY	Five?
MERRICK	Five.
BUFFY	So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
MERRICK	Not if you're careful.
BUFFY	How can you keep doing this?
MERRICK	It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
BUFFY	Watchers?
MERRICK	There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
BUFFY	I wish you would.
MERRICK	It isn't important.
BUFFY	I'm curious, is all.
MERRICK	Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
BUFFY	And it makes it worse when I die, right?

BUFFY	Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
MERRICK	As for example, what?
BUFFY	Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
MERRICK	Vampires of the world, beware.
BUFFY	Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.

BUFFY	I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
MERRICK	I can't work this.
BUFFY	We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
MERRICK	But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
BUFFY	Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
MERRICK	My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
BUFFY	Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.

MERRICK	I want to die.
BUFFY	Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.

MERRICK	Interesting.
BUFFY	I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.

MERRICK	There isn't time.
BUFFY	Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
MERRICK	Another distraction.  It's not right.
BUFFY	Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
MERRICK	Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
BUFFY	I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
MERRICK	All right.
BUFFY	Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
MERRICK	Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
BUFFY	Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
MERRICK	Football is my life.
BUFFY	You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.

MERRICK	None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
BUFFY	And where are they now?

MERRICK	Wait!
BUFFY	He knows who I am!

BUFFY	Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
NICOLE	You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
BUFFY	Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!

BUFFY	No THX.
NICOLE	They don't even have Dolby.

NICOLE	So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
BUFFY	That's the plan.
NICOLE	Good enough!

NICOLE	Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
BUFFY	Cassandra, you gotta come, too.

NICOLE	Come one, that was so weird.
BUFFY	What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.

NICOLE	-- like she's gonna kill me.
BUFFY	I was just scared is all.
NICOLE	No.  It was mondo bizarro.

BUFFY	That is so cool.
NICOLE	Thank you very much.
BUFFY	Nobody is even gonna look at the game.

NICOLE	I don't get it.
BUFFY	How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.

BUFFY	You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
NICOLE	Cassandra's really smart.
BUFFY	Yeah... She's okay, though.
NICOLE	I guess.

BUFFY	Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
NICOLE	Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
BUFFY	B'bye.

NICOLE	Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed.
BUFFY	Thanks.
NICOLE	You and Cassandra get anything done last night?

NICOLE	Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps.
BUFFY	Sorry.

BUFFY	Pike.
NICOLE	You're having a fling with him?

NICOLE	Well, I guess you got what you came for.
BUFFY	Nicole...
NICOLE	Later for it.

BUFFY	Hi, guys.
NICOLE	Hi.
BUFFY	Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.

NICOLE	I haven't seen him tonight.
BUFFY	Oh.

LOTHOS	I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
CASSANDRA	What's happening?  What do you want?
LOTHOS	So very much.
CASSANDRA	My parents have money...
LOTHOS	Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.

CASSANDRA	What... are you?
LOTHOS	Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.

CASSANDRA	No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
LOTHOS	Really?
CASSANDRA	Swear to God.

GIRL	I can't!
MAN	You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
GIRL	Why?  Why me?
MAN	She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.

MAN	The mark of the Coven.
GIRL	I don't understand.
MAN	Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.

MAN	But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
GIRL	I'm just a girl.
MAN	You are much more.

GRUELLER	Bessel!  What are you doing here?
WALLY	Hi, Grueller.
GRUELLER	What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
WALLY	Could be.
GRUELLER	You think so?
WALLY	Could be.

GRUELLER	Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
WALLY	Got that.
GRUELLER	Good.

JEFFREY	Write that down.
JENNIFER	Okay, what else?

JENNIFER	Oh, yes!  Yes!
JEFFREY	Oh, baby!
JENNIFER	Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!

JEFFREY	Buffy?
JENNIFER	Jeffrey!

JEFFREY	Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
JENNIFER	No --
JEFFREY	Okay, let's go.
JENNIFER	But --

JENNIFER	She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
JEFFREY	I heard she got straight A's.

KIMBERLY	I can't believe they still ate it.
JENNIFER	Where'd you learn how to do that?

JENNIFER	So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
KIMBERLY	Well, I hope so.
JENNIFER	Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.

JENNIFER	I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
KIMBERLY	Throw it out.

JENNIFER	And Spring Fling.
KIMBERLY	Okay.

JENNIFER	She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
KIMBERLY	Buffy?

JENNIFER	Omniplex?
NICOLE	Nee sitch.  No way.

JENNIFER	What happened?
NICOLE	Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
JENNIFER	You're kidding.
NICOLE	Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
JENNIFER	Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
NICOLE	Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --

JENNIFER	I never thought of that.
NICOLE	I gotta bail.  You coming?

NICOLE	Buffy!
JENNIFER	What is she...

NICOLE	Cool!
JENNIFER	Does Jeffrey know?

PIKE	The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
KIMBERLY	Wit-tay.
PIKE	I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
KIMBERLY	Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
PIKE	Hey, wait a minute...

KIMBERLY	They'll kill us!
PIKE	You want some punch?

NICOLE	Oh, God.
KIMBERLY	He is so bald.

NICOLE	God!  Take a chill lozenge.
KIMBERLY	Like we don't have rights too?

NICOLE	The homelesses?
KIMBERLY	Oh, please.

NICOLE	Environment.  That's cool with me.
KIMBERLY	Okay.

KIMBERLY	Oh, yeah!
NICOLE	Right!

NICOLE	If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
KIMBERLY	Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
NICOLE	Well, look who's here.

KIMBERLY	Smell of booze much.
NICOLE	Nice much.

KIMBERLY	Buffy, the ape-woman.
NICOLE	Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?

NICOLE	I really was way way too too.
KIMBERLY	Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
NICOLE	I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.

NICOLE	What are you talking about?
KIMBERLY	Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.

KIMBERLY	Oh, thank you very much.
NICOLE	Like you've got a grip.
KIMBERLY	You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --

NICOLE	So, we're stupid now?
KIMBERLY	You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
NICOLE	Except for Prom.
KIMBERLY	Right.

NICOLE	And the January Semi-formal --
KIMBERLY	Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.

NICOLE	It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
KIMBERLY	As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?

ZEPH	What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
PIKE	I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
ZEPH	Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
PIKE	Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
ZEPH	No...  You want me to give him a message?
PIKE	You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.

ZEPH	Ah, you'll be coming back.
PIKE	I don't think so.
ZEPH	All right.  Take care of yourself.
PIKE	I am.
ZEPH	Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
PIKE	Run.

MASON	Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
ARLO	Oh.
MASON	Why don't I--?
ARLO	No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.

ARLO	Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
MASON	Hang on.  Hang on.

ARLO	Sorry, man.  He's dead.
MASON	 No.

ARLO	What did I say?
ARLO	Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
MASON	I need your truck.
ARLO	No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
ARLO	...and a shitload of ice.
MASON	Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
MASON	...-tana.
ARLO	Wait, wait.  You don't believe the dead guy, do...
ARLO	...ya?
MASON	Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
ARLO	For cryin' out loud.
ARLO	Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
ARLO	...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
ARLO	...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
MASON	I need your help.
ARLO	You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
ARLO	...truck.
MASON	Then you drive me to McGrud-...
MASON	...-er.
ARLO	Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
ARLO	And if that Elvis shit...
ARLO	...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
ARLO	Peace.
MASON	All right.
MASON	Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
MASON	You want cash?
MASON	You want cash?
MASON	I got, like, uh....
MASON	I got, uh....
MASON	I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.
MASON	I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
ARLO	No.
MASON	All right, then how about this?
ARLO	Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
ARLO	...doing?!
MASON	I need your truck!
ARLO	You are not takin' my truck!

MASON	Go on.
ARLO	Would you hurry up, please?
MASON	Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
MASON	There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
ARLO	What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
MASON	You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
ARLO	Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
MASON	What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
ARLO	That dog was mean before I met him.
MASON	That dog ain't mean.
ARLO	I'm gonna stomp your a--
MASON	Come on, get in the truck.
ARLO	I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
MASON	Shut...

MASON	...up.
ARLO	Are you kiddin'?
MASON	Come on!
ARLO	Damn.
MASON	What the hell's goin' on?
ARLO	It happens to this piece of shit...
ARLO	...all the time.
ARLO	Damn diesel injections are flood-...
MASON	 Excuse me...
ARLO	...-ed.
MASON	...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
ARLO	Do you wanna give me a minute?

MASON	You'd better coast through...
MASON	...town. 

MASON	We're clear.
ARLO	Oh, man.

MASON	No cell.
ARLO	Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.

MASON	Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
ARLO	No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
ARLO	...-er.
MASON	No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
ARLO	No, no, no.
ARLO	To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
MASON	No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
MASON	...-er.
ARLO	I ain't goin' through Missoula!
MASON	Am I missing somethin' here?
ARLO	Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
MASON	Borrowed.
ARLO	Yeah, borrowed!
MASON	You stole this truck.
MASON	You stole this truck!
ARLO	I did not steal this truck!
MASON	You stole this truck! That's...
MASON	...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
MASON	...the ice cream for money!
ARLO	I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
MASON	Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  We're goin' to McGruder.

ARLO	I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
MASON	That's...
MASON	...fine.
ARLO	I ain't playin' that.
MASON	 Shut up.

ARLO	Hey.
ARLO	We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
MASON	Fine. 

ARLO	 
MASON	God-...
MASON	...-damn!
ARLO	Okay, okay! 
MASON	Ah, one of them's in the back.
MASON	No, no, no, no, no.  Keep goin'.
ARLO	Okay. 



ARLO	You're nuts, goin' back there!
MASON	Shut up.
ARLO	Take your gun!
MASON	Doesn't work.
ARLO	What?
MASON	Doesn't...
MASON	...work!  It's not even load-...
MASON	...-ed.
ARLO	You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?!

ARLO	Oh, shit.
ARLO	Oh...

ARLO	Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
MASON	All right.
ARLO	Okay!  All right!

MASON	    Elvis is on ice again.
ARLO	Okay.
MASON	 Nice job back there.
ARLO	Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
ARLO	...gun?!
MASON	I was thankin' you, asshole!
ARLO	Kiss my ass!

ARLO	Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
MASON	 No...
MASON	...I'm not the psycho.
ARLO	Hey, take a look at your situation and...
ARLO	...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
ARLO	...-cho and a hijack-...
ARLO	...-er!
MASON	Hi--!  The gun was empty!
ARLO	Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
ARLO	...you.
MASON	You wanna hit me?
ARLO	And I'm a peaceful man, and...
ARLO	...I believe in live and...
MASON	 Yeah...
ARLO	...let live.
MASON	...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
ARLO	I did not steal the truck.
MASON	 
ARLO	It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
ARLO	...truck!
MASON	Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
ARLO	Well, then, that means it's call...
ARLO	...waiting!
MASON	You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
ARLO	Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.

ARLO	Oh!

MASON	Holy shit...
MASON	...man!
ARLO	Oh, shit.
MASON	Back up!  Back...
MASON	...up!
ARLO	Come on, old...
ARLO	...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
ARLO	...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
MASON	All right, you got it.

MASON	Fuck! 
MASON	Oh, shit.
ARLO	  Oh, we're screwed, Night...
ARLO	...Shift.
ARLO	You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
MASON	I think...
MASON	...we can make it.
ARLO	You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
ARLO	Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
ARLO	Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
ARLO	Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
MASON	I don't think we have much of a choice...
MASON	...do we?
ARLO	Oh, shit.
MASON	That's right.  Now,  move!
ARLO	Oh, shit.
ARLO	 Okay.
MASON	Okay. 

MASON	Goddamn!
ARLO	Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.

ARLO	 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
ARLO	Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
MASON	Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
MASON	Oh, shit.
ARLO	Come on, old Pete.
ARLO	Come on!
ARLO	Come on, old Pete.
ARLO	God, man!
ARLO	I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
MASON	 Oh...
MASON	...easy, easy, easy.
MASON	Left, left, left!
MASON	Get over!  Get over!
ARLO	Come on.
ARLO	Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
ARLO	...Pete!  Come on.
ARLO	Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
ARLO	I know the likeli-...
ARLO	...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
ARLO	...Night Shift, but you might...
ARLO	...wanna give it a try!
ARLO	Come on, old...
ARLO	...Pete.  Come on.
ARLO	Come on.
ARLO	Come on.
ARLO	Come on...
ARLO	...you crazy bastard.
MASON	All right, you got it, you got it!

MASON	Whoo!
ARLO	Whoo!
MASON	I made it!
MASON	 I made it.
ARLO	What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
MASON	You okay?
ARLO	What the fuck was that?!
MASON	Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
ARLO	Gee, you think so?
ARLO	Holy--!
ARLO	 Okay.  That didn't work.
MASON	 Gee, you think so?
ARLO	Shut up!
MASON	Ho, ho...
ARLO	 Oh...
MASON	...ho!
ARLO	 ...shit!
ARLO	 
MASON	Hang on!
MASON	Hey!

ARLO	 Shit. 
MASON	 Go on.
ARLO	 Go, go.
ARLO	Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
ARLO	No.  Shit.
MASON	Come on.
ARLO	 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
ARLO	Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
ARLO	Okay.
MASON	All right.
MASON	Okay.
ARLO	All right.
MASON	Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
ARLO	 Okay.  Okay. 
MASON	These'll keep it cold.
ARLO	Yeah...
ARLO	...yeah.
MASON	 Aw, shit  
MASON	All right, let's go.
ARLO	Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
MASON	Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.

ARLO	 Listen!  Listen...
ARLO	...to him!  You don't know who...
ARLO	...you're dealin' with!
MASON	I'm a dangerous man!
ARLO	Yeah, he's a dangerous...
ARLO	...man!
ARLO	He's crazy!
MASON	I'm crazy?

MASON	Taking it down the hill.
ARLO	You're--?  What?!
ARLO	You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
MASON	Then stay...
MASON	...here!
ARLO	Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.

MASON	I don't want you to come anyway. 
ARLO	What?
MASON	Come on!
ARLO	Oh, shit.



MASON	Keep still.
ARLO	Okay.  Okay.
ARLO	Oh, shit!
MASON	No!
ARLO	Oh, no!
ARLO	Oh, no!

ARLO	 All right.  Hey.
ARLO	Whoo-hoo-hoo!

ARLO	Uh-oh.
MASON	What?
ARLO	This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
MASON	This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
ARLO	Okay.
ARLO	Worth a try.
ARLO	Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
ARLO	...did you?
MASON	You're fucked, man.
ARLO	See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
ARLO	...-tion?
MASON	Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
MASON	...stole the truck.
ARLO	Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
ARLO	...piece of shit was worth.
MASON	It won't even start half the time.
ARLO	You know what I'm sayin'?
ARLO	I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
ARLO	And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
ARLO	...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
ARLO	...or nephew or some good old boy...
ARLO	...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
ARLO	...overdrawn bank accounts.
ARLO	Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
MASON	So you took his...
MASON	...truck.
ARLO	So I took his truck, yeah.
MASON	 Yeah.
ARLO	You know.

MASON	You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
MASON	We were nationally  ranked.
ARLO	How wonderful for you.
MASON	Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
ARLO	Robert Del Rio?
MASON	Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
ARLO	I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
MASON	We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
MASON	And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
MASON	...hospital.
MASON	Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
MASON	Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
MASON	And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
MASON	Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
ARLO	Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
MASON	We got two paddles.

MASON	Listen, Arlo...
MASON	...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
MASON	...shit.
ARLO	To tell you the truth, you didn't.
ARLO	Not completely, anyway.
ARLO	I mean, if that gun was...
ARLO	...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
ARLO	...-er.  It was your friend...
ARLO	...Long.  Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
ARLO	...shit.
MASON	Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
MASON	...split.
ARLO	Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
ARLO	...miles.
ARLO	Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.

ARLO	That is loud!  I'm 
MASON	 Whoo!
ARLO	Yeah, baby!

ARLO	All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
ARLO	Hey.   Mason.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	I think you oughta cut a...
ARLO	...deal with this asshole.
ARLO	Even though it is nice to see Andy...
ARLO	 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
ARLO	...or my conscience.
ARLO	A-And you  owe me...
ARLO	...man.
MASON	Yeah, I know, I know.

ARLO	 
MASON	Bring him down!

MASON	You all right?

ARLO	Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.

MASON	Ow!  
ARLO	Are you all right?
MASON	No. 

MASON	Listen, Arlo.
ARLO	Hey!

ARLO	They're takin' off.
MASON	Huh?
ARLO	They're movin'.

MASON	Hey, just shut up.
ARLO	We're gonna die!
MASON	Arlo, shut up.

ARLO	We're gonna die!
ARLO	We're gonna die!
MASON	Hey, hey, hey.
MASON	Put your hand in my pants.
ARLO	What?
ARLO	We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
MASON	Arlo!  Arlo.
MASON	Reach into my pocket.
MASON	 Come on!
ARLO	Oh.
ARLO	 Okay.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	 Okay.
ARLO	Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
MASON	Okay. 
ARLO	 All right.  Okay.
ARLO	Okay. 
MASON	Arlo!
ARLO	 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 



ARLO	Okay. 
ARLO	Come on, come on!

ARLO	Okay, here we go.
ARLO	Come here.
MASON	Go, go, go! 

ARLO	You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
ARLO	...-natic.
MASON	 That's why I didn't give it...
MASON	...to him. 
ARLO	What?
ARLO	You got Elvis?!
MASON	Sometimes the prey bites back.
MASON	Go!
MASON	Stop.
ARLO	Hang...
ARLO	...on!

MASON	Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
MASON	...-ful?!
ARLO	Okay.  Okay.

MASON	Oh, fuck!
MASON	Forty-five seven!
ARLO	Oh, shit.
MASON	Okay.

ARLO	We!
MASON	  I've got the real thing!
ARLO	We've got Elvis!

ARLO	Here...
ARLO	...they come!
MASON	And Brynner's right on...
MASON	...our ass!
ARLO	He's comin' up fast!

ARLO	Okay...
ARLO	...here comes the...
ARLO	...tunnel!
MASON	Tunnel.

MASON	Whoo!
ARLO	Whoo!

MASON	Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
ARLO	What do you think I'm doin'?!

MASON	What the hell?
ARLO	What the--?
MASON	You've gotta be...

ARLO	Stupid.
MASON	I'm gonna kill him.

ARLO	Unbe-fucking-lievable.
MASON	 

ARLO	Shoot me. 
MASON	 What's it say? 
ARLO	Forty-nine point four.
MASON	 It says forty- nine.

ARLO	Mason.
MASON	What?
ARLO	It's melting, man.



ARLO	All right 

MASON	Oh.
MASON	Come on.  Come on.
ARLO	 

ARLO	What?
MASON	 
ARLO	What?
MASON	It's working.
MASON	We got-...
MASON	...-ta get outta here!
ARLO	 Vitelli! Vitelli!
ARLO	Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?

ARLO	Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
MASON	 There's gotta be...
MASON	...another way  outta here.    Hey.
ARLO	Hold this. 
MASON	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ARLO	Sorry.

ARLO	Hang on, hang on.
MASON	Let's go!
ARLO	Go.

ARLO	Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
MASON	Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
MASON	They'll meet you at the top.
ARLO	Okay.  Come on, big guy!

ARLO	Look out.
MASON	What'd you come back for?!
ARLO	Why'd you stay behind?!

MASON	Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!

ARLO	 Well.
ARLO	You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
ARLO	We're the shit.  Bigtime.
MASON	They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
ARLO	Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
ARLO	Stop limpin' around like that.
MASON	Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
ARLO	Always the negative...

MASON	You did help a little.
ARLO	Who drove the ice cream...
ARLO	...truck that kept Elvis cool?
MASON	Who had to put a gun to your head?
ARLO	Who put the big hurt on...
ARLO	...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
MASON	You, Arlo.
ARLO	Hello.
MASON	You.
ARLO	Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
ARLO	...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
ARLO	...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
MASON	Us.  Owes us.
ARLO	I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.

MASON	Patriotism is its own reward.
ARLO	I think so too.
MASON	 Yeah.
MASON	Thank you.
ARLO	Thank you very much.
MASON	What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
MASON	...face" crap you've been telling me?
ARLO	I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
ARLO	...-tiatin'.
MASON	Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
MASON	...us.
ARLO	But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
MASON	No.
MASON	That's bullshit.
ARLO	Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
MASON	Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.

ARLO	Oh!
MASON	Oh, oh!
ARLO	I feel faint.
MASON	Ooh.

ARLO	You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
MASON	Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ARLO	It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	I was undercover as a tennis player.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
ARLO	Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
MASON	Yeah.
ARLO	 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
MASON	 big balls.
ARLO	That's right.

ARLO	Hey.
ARLO	Hey, be cool.
ARLO	Be cool.  Be--
ARLO	That was quick.
BRYNNER	To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
BRYNNER	We're worried...
BRYNNER	...about him.
ARLO	I'll keep an eye out.

BRYNNER	Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
BRYNNER	...within five minutes.
ARLO	It's for you.

ARLO	What'd he say?
BRYNNER	Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.

ARLO	Listen, shithead!
ARLO	I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
ARLO	...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
BRYNNER	 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
ARLO	I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...

BRYNNER	Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
ARLO	Oh, my God.

BRYNNER	I urge you to be persuasive.
BRYNNER	This country trained me to kill...
BRYNNER	...without compunction.
ARLO	Well, well, well.
ARLO	Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
BRYNNER	Three seconds.  One...



BRYNNER	And it won't be pleasant. 
BRYNNER	But...
BRYNNER	...such is the price...of patriotism.
BRYNNER	Vaughn.
ARLO	Hey!



ARLO	Well, that just about figures for today.
ICE CREAM ANDY	So...where's my truck?
ARLO	It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
ICE CREAM ANDY	I did what I could for you...
ICE CREAM ANDY	...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
ARLO	I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?

ARLO	Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
ARLO	...help you?
ICE CREAM ANDY	 Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.  Whatever you want.  Please!

ARLO	Yeah, that's my truck.
LONG	Mason, you have to take this...
LONG	 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
ARLO	Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
ARLO	...take my sorry old truck.
LONG	We do need your truck.

ARLO	So you called the damned thing Elvis
LONG	I had no idea how powerful it was.
LONG	 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
LONG	 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
LONG	...here.   Mason... 
LONG	...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
LONG	You-You can't let him...
LONG	 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
ARLO	  Hey, actually...

PAPPAS	You got a prob-...
PAPPAS	...-lem too?
ARLO	No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
ARLO	Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.

ARLO	Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
PAPPAS	What the hell's a sage?

ARLO	Listen, deputy.
ARLO	He's the dude...
ARLO	...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
PAPPAS	Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.

VITELLI	What?  Say again...
VITELLI	 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
ARLO	We've got it...
ARLO	...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
VITELLI	Hold it!

VITELLI	All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
ARLO	Thank you.
VITELLI	Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
VITELLI	...owe you.
ARLO	Us.  Owe us. 

VITELLI	We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
VITELLI	...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
ARLO	Exactly.
VITELLI	However, you are also non-en-...
VITELLI	...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
VITELLI	In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
VITELLI	...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
VITELLI	...including the permanently extreme.
ARLO	I'd say we're about even.





ARLO	Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!

MASON & ARLO	Whoo-hoo! 
ARLO	Are you crazy?!  Take the boat?!



BIG RANGER	Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
VITELLI	Is it--?
BIG RANGER	Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
VITELLI	Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.

BIG RANGER	They were all wearing hardware.

L129061	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
L129060	u4467	m295	VITELLI	...here!
L129059	u4467	m295	VITELLI	Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...

L129044	u4467	m295	VITELLI	I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
L129043	u4467	m295	VITELLI	As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
L129042	u4467	m295	VITELLI	And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
L129041	u4467	m295	VITELLI	I can't say it's a surprise.
L129040	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	Pleasant surprise.
L129039	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	Good to see you again, Leo.

L129195	u4451	m295	BRYNNER	Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?
L129194	u4452	m295	CARL	Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
L128754	u4452	m295	CARL

L127868	u4453	m295	DARLENE	...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
L127867	u4453	m295	DARLENE	Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
L127866	u4459	m295	LONG	Oh, no?

L129069	u4455	m295	GOMEZ	All right, let's move...
L129068	u4467	m295	VITELLI	Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
L129067	u4455	m295	GOMEZ	Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!

L128446	u4458	m295	LEWIS	Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
L128445	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
L128444	u4458	m295	LEWIS	It must've happened right after we left.
L128443	u4462	m295	PAPPAS	Thanks.

L128128	u4460	m295	MASON	And what if it does?
L128127	u4459	m295	LONG	Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
L128126	u4460	m295	MASON	Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
L128125	u4459	m295	LONG	 ...or it'll ignite.

L128096	u4459	m295	LONG	 No...

L127837	u4459	m295	LONG	There's only one way you can do it, Mason.

L127830	u4460	m295	MASON	...like a fish.
L127829	u4460	m295	MASON	And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
L127828	u4460	m295	MASON	...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
L127827	u4460	m295	MASON	Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
L127826	u4459	m295	LONG	My secret?

L127723	u4459	m295	LONG	We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
L127722	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
L127721	u4459	m295	LONG	How much longer for the range and power projections?
L127720	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	Well, your prediction was on the nose.
L127719	u4459	m295	LONG	So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
L127718	u4465	m295	SWEENEY	Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
L127717	u4459	m295	LONG	Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
L127716	u4465	m295	SWEENEY

BRYNNER	Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
BRYNNER	...and the government.
LONG	Grateful?
BRYNNER	Mm-hm.
BRYNNER	Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
BRYNNER	Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
BRYNNER	...you were right, of course.  But after...
BRYNNER	...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
BRYNNER	What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
BRYNNER	...always done, Richard?
LONG	Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
LONG	...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
BRYNNER	Went away? 
BRYNNER	Went away.  I like that.
BRYNNER	Almost quaint.
LONG	All right.  After they put you away...
LONG	...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
BRYNNER	And let me guess.  You failed.
LONG	So far, ye-yes.
BRYNNER	Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...

BRYNNER	Forget about him.

PAPPAS	Lying? 
PAPPAS	Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
PAPPAS	...public drunkenness....
MASON	I didn't sell the boy any...
MASON	...beer.
PAPPAS	Shut your mouth until I tell you...
PAPPAS	...to talk, son.
MASON	You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."

BELLE	Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
JABEZ	From over the mountain --

JABEZ	I'll take it.
BELLE	No -- that's for me to do.

JABEZ	Let's dance together -- Belle.
BELLE	No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --

JABEZ	Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
BELLE	We will --

JABEZ	We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
BELLE	Of course I will.

BELLE	The people, Jabez -- the people.
JABEZ	The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?

JABEZ	Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
BELLE	Jabez! Careful --
JABEZ	Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.

JABEZ	What are those people doing there? What do they want?
BELLE	They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --

JABEZ	Who are these people?
BELLE	They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.

MARY	Jabez -- ?
BELLE	I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --

BELLE	You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
MARY	No, thank you -- what's your name?
BELLE	Belle --
MARY	Thank you, Belle --

BELLE	That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
MARY	He lied to me again.

BELLE	I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
MARY	I didn't.
BELLE	You're lying.
MARY	Lying to you -- Why should I?
BELLE	You know that you're in my house.
MARY	I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
BELLE	You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
MARY	That's my problem, Belle.

WEBSTER	Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
DANIEL	Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
WEBSTER	All right, Daniel. Jump in.

DANIEL	Gee -- that Fair --
WEBSTER	It hasn't opened yet?
DANIEL	No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
WEBSTER	Guess there will, if it says so.
DANIEL	And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
WEBSTER	Young man -- you got me there.
DANIEL	'N Daniel Webster will be there.
WEBSTER	A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
DANIEL	I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
WEBSTER	And what about Daniel Webster?
DANIEL	Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
WEBSTER	And serve him right!

WEBSTER	Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
DANIEL	Why? It don't hurt.
WEBSTER	It does hurt! And don't you do it again.

DANIEL	Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
WEBSTER	No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
DANIEL	Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
WEBSTER	Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
DANIEL	What's that, sir?
WEBSTER	Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
DANIEL	Anybody can see that.
WEBSTER	You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
DANIEL	But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
WEBSTER	No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.

MARY	Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
DANIEL	It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
MARY	Daniel give me that beanshooter!
DANIEL	No! No! I won't.
MARY	Daniel! ...  I've stood just about as much as I can bear!

MARY	Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
DANIEL	No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.

DANIEL	Mama!
MARY	Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
DANIEL	I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
MARY	All right, darling.

DANIEL	Granny, when do we move to the new house?
MA STONE	Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
DANIEL	But I like the new one better.
MA STONE	That's just too bad --

MA STONE	Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
DANIEL	I did not, Grandma.

DANIEL	Grandma, look at me!
MA STONE	I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
DANIEL	Not me! 

HANK	Howdy, Jabez.
JABEZ	Howdy, Hank.
HANK	Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
JABEZ	Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
HANK	Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
JABEZ	I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
HANK	Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
JABEZ	Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
HANK	Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
JABEZ	Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
HANK	Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...

HANK	Say ... about the interest ...
JABEZ	Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...

TOM SHARP	Loan shark -- hey?
JABEZ	Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
TOM SHARP	Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
JABEZ	Sure am.
TOM SHARP	Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!

JABEZ	Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
TOM SHARP	That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.

JABEZ	I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
TOM SHARP	Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
JABEZ	Black Dan'l?

JABEZ	What do you want?
TOM SHARP	Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
JABEZ	What Grange?
TOM SHARP	That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.

TOM SHARP	Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
JABEZ	I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.

TOM SHARP	Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
JABEZ	Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
TOM SHARP	We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.

JABEZ	You're not -- Dorothy.
THE WOMAN	No. She's gone.
JABEZ	She couldn't be gone!
THE WOMAN	But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.

JABEZ	Never mind. What's your name?
THE WOMAN	Belle.
JABEZ	Belle --

JABEZ	Stevens!
STEVENS	Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
JABEZ	I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
STEVENS	No, Stone!
JABEZ	-- in gold.
STEVENS	I'd like to know where you'd get it....
JABEZ	You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
STEVENS	Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
JABEZ	Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....

STEVENS	Mornin', Jabez ...
JABEZ	Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
STEVENS	Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
JABEZ	Some other time, Stevens.

STEVENS	Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
JABEZ	No, you're not.
STEVENS	Where's everybody?
JABEZ	I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?

JABEZ	Now run along, Daniel.
STEVENS	What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
JABEZ	Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
STEVENS	Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--

JABEZ	What's the matter with you?
STEVENS	You are afraid!
JABEZ	Afraid ... of what?
STEVENS	-- of what happens after we die!
JABEZ	Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
STEVENS	But what becomes of our souls?
JABEZ	Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
STEVENS	Don't say that -- I know it is --
JABEZ	All right -- so it's buried with you!
STEVENS	What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
JABEZ	Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
STEVENS	I do -- and I think you should too.
JABEZ	Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!

SCRATCH	Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
JABEZ	You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
SCRATCH	You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
JABEZ	Opportunities?
SCRATCH	Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
JABEZ	Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
SCRATCH	A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!

JABEZ	Where did it come from?
SCRATCH	Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
JABEZ	Yes, why shouldn't it?
SCRATCH	Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.

JABEZ	It's mine?
SCRATCH	That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
JABEZ	What does it mean here -- about my soul?
SCRATCH	Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--

JABEZ	No, no! Give it to me!
SCRATCH	A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?

SCRATCH	Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
JABEZ	Well, I'll be -- 
SCRATCH	Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
JABEZ	The seventh day of April --
SCRATCH	1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.

SCRATCH	Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
JABEZ	Look here now--
SCRATCH	Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
JABEZ	I don't care.
SCRATCH	But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
JABEZ	Leave your tongue off of that!
SCRATCH	Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.

SCRATCH	Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
JABEZ	You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
SCRATCH	Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.

SCRATCH	.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
JABEZ	He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
SCRATCH	He was --

JABEZ	Are they all as -- small -- as that?
SCRATCH	Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
JABEZ	My time isn't up yet.

SCRATCH	Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
JABEZ	I'm through with you.
SCRATCH	What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
JABEZ	I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
SCRATCH	Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
JABEZ	Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
SCRATCH	Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
JABEZ	Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
SCRATCH	I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
JABEZ	No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
SCRATCH	Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.

SCRATCH	Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
JABEZ	About what?
SCRATCH	Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
JABEZ	Never!

SCRATCH	Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
JABEZ	Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
SCRATCH	That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.

JABEZ	Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
SCRATCH	But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
JABEZ	You know darn well it is.
SCRATCH	Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.

JABEZ	Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
WEBSTER	Ten throws it is.

WEBSTER	You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
JABEZ	Thank you, Mr. Webster.

WEBSTER	I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
JABEZ	Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
WEBSTER	Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.

WEBSTER	Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
JABEZ	Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!

WEBSTER	Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
JABEZ	Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
WEBSTER	Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin.

JABEZ	Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
WEBSTER	That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
JABEZ	What -- what's on your mind?
WEBSTER	You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
JABEZ	Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
WEBSTER	They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!

WEBSTER	I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
JABEZ	I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
WEBSTER	No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
JABEZ	It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!

WEBSTER	It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
JABEZ	Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
WEBSTER	I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
JABEZ	Yes -- at midnight.

WEBSTER	They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
JABEZ	Not long -- now.
WEBSTER	Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.

WEBSTER	There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
JABEZ	There's no joy in it for me.
WEBSTER	Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler.

WEBSTER	You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
JABEZ	Well, I --
WEBSTER	I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.

JABEZ	Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
WEBSTER	Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.

SQUIRE	Coming along, Jabez?
JABEZ	Shall we?

JABEZ	Why -- good morning, Squire.
SQUIRE	Morning, Jabez.

SQUIRE	Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
JABEZ	Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.

JABEZ	Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
SQUIRE	Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--

SQUIRE	Oh!
JABEZ	Headache -- Squire?
SQUIRE	Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
JABEZ	Camomile tea!

SQUIRE	And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
JABEZ	Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?

JABEZ	But -- I was just lucky.
SQUIRE	Well? Don't a politician have to be?

JABEZ	Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
SQUIRE	How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
JABEZ	You really think so?

SQUIRE	Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
JABEZ	Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
SQUIRE	Why of course --
JABEZ	Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
SQUIRE	Dan'l Webster?
JABEZ	Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
SQUIRE	Yes.
JABEZ	Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
SQUIRE	The only one you missed -- is the President.
JABEZ	You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.

JABEZ	You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
SQUIRE	You want me to go around --
JABEZ	Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
SQUIRE	You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
JABEZ	Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
SQUIRE	Well -- yes --
JABEZ	That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
SQUIRE	You are not so sure that he'll come.
JABEZ	Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
SQUIRE	Why not -- ?
JABEZ	How much?
SQUIRE	5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
JABEZ	Shake!















JABEZ	 ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
L164170	u4828	m322	JABEZ	It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
L164169	u4831	m322	MARY	Who is it?
L164168	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
L164158	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
L164157	u4831	m322	MARY	He's stubborn as a Stone.
L164152	u4828	m322	JABEZ	That's what we said.
L164151	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
L164150	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
L164149	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yep.
L164148	u4831	m322	MARY	Oh, Jabez.
L164147	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I think his leg is broken.
L164140	u4828	m322	JABEZ	You're right, Mary.
L164139	u4831	m322	MARY	Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
L164138	u4828	m322	JABEZ	What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
L164134	u4828	m322	JABEZ	All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
L164133	u4831	m322	MARY	He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
L164132	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Down, Shep! Down!
L164131	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Coming.
L164130	u4831	m322	MARY	Jabez -- help!
L165025	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
L165024	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
L164915	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
L164914	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
L164913	u4829	m322	MA STONE	My son ... what's the matter?
L164654	u4829	m322	MA STONE	And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
L164653	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I want you to fix these fish!
L164604	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Sure, Ma.
L164603	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
L164594	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
L164593	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
L164592	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You'll be a father any minute now.
L164591	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ma -- is she? --
L164569	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
L164568	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
L164567	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I say -- it don't matter.
L164566	u4829	m322	MA STONE	What's that you say, Son?
L164565	u4828	m322	JABEZ	It don't matter!
L164564	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
L164553	u4829	m322	MA STONE	A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
L164552	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
L164551	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
L164550	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Wouldn't profit him none.
L164549	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
L164548	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
L164547	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Do you really think that?
L164546	u4829	m322	MA STONE	I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
L164545	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
L164544	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Me -- a son.
L164543	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
L164542	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
L164541	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
L164540	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
L164538	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
L164537	u4828	m322	JABEZ	My son! Do you really think, Ma....
L164536	u4829	m322	MA STONE	It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
L164516	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
L164515	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
L164324	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
L164323	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
L164319	u4828	m322	JABEZ	But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
L164318	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
L164317	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
L164316	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You found it in the barn, hey?
L164260	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
L164259	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Hush up such talk, Jabez!
L164258	u4828	m322	JABEZ	And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
L164257	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Well ... make him keep quiet.
L164256	u4828	m322	JABEZ	I dunno.
L164255	u4829	m322	MA STONE	What's ailing that dog?
L164246	u4829	m322	MA STONE	All right, son -- if it helps.
L164245	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Helps sometimes to say it.
L164244	u4829	m322	MA STONE	That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
L164243	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
L164242	u4829	m322	MA STONE	I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
L164241	u4828	m322	JABEZ	How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
L164164	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
L164163	u4828	m322	JABEZ	There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
L164162	u4828	m322	JABEZ	That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
L164161	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
L164160	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Hard luck -- like me.
L164159	u4829	m322	MA STONE	You know that, son.
L164156	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
L164155	u4829	m322	MA STONE	Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
L164154	u4828	m322	JABEZ	Consarn the consarn --
L164153	u4829	m322	MA STONE	There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
MARY	That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
JABEZ	If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.

JABEZ	Well -- what are we going to do?
MARY	We can still use my butter money.
JABEZ	Your butter money?
MARY	Do you think I'm grudging it?
JABEZ	Mary -- it's gone.
MARY	Not all of it?
JABEZ	Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
MARY	It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
JABEZ	If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
MARY	Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
JABEZ	To save us work on the spring plowing?
MARY	You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
JABEZ	Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
MARY	Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
JABEZ	I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.

MARY	Jabez!
JABEZ	Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
MARY	Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
JABEZ	You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.

JABEZ	Mary--
MARY	Jabez ...
JABEZ	Mary -- how do you feel?

JABEZ	I'll get the doctor.
MARY	No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.

JABEZ	Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
MARY	Jabez!
JABEZ	Mary -- what would you do?
MARY	Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
JABEZ	Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.

MARY	It feels fine now, Jabez.
JABEZ	Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
MARY	I'd love to.

MARY	What do you think of that, Jabez?
JABEZ	Looks right elegant, Mary.

MARY	We must go on home, Jabez.
JABEZ	Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.

JABEZ	Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
MARY	Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --

MARY	But I'm glad to be home again --
JABEZ	Tired?
MARY	Worried!
JABEZ	There is nothing to worry about now.
MARY	You'll never change -- will you?
JABEZ	Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.

MARY	There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
JABEZ	Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
MARY	Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.

JABEZ	Mary --
MARY	Jabez --

JABEZ	Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
MARY	I'll get it, Jabez.
JABEZ	Thanks, Mary.

JABEZ	Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
MARY	Oh -- Jabez.

JABEZ	You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
MARY	I'll never get my washing done.
JABEZ	That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
MARY	Yes, Mr. Selectman!
JABEZ	I'm serious.
MARY	It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
JABEZ	But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
MARY	But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
JABEZ	Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
MARY	No, no. I don't want to be idle.
JABEZ	And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.

MARY	Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
JABEZ	I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.

MARY	Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
JABEZ	Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.

JABEZ	Mary --
MARY	Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.

JABEZ	Well -- I -- I-
MARY	Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.

MARY	Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
JABEZ	What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
MARY	Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --

JABEZ	What happened.... Where are you taking him?
MARY	I am going to lock him up.
JABEZ	You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.

MARY	Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
JABEZ	Isn't that your own fault?
MARY	My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
JABEZ	He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
MARY	But Jabez, I never said that!
JABEZ	It shows on your face.
MARY	Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
JABEZ	Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!

JABEZ	Why don't they come --
MARY	I don't know, Jabez.

JABEZ	Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
MARY	It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
JABEZ	What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come?

JABEZ	Mr. Webster ... Wait! ...  Mary!
MARY	Jabez!
JABEZ	Mary! Come back ...
MARY	Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?

JABEZ	You must go now, Mary -- you must!
MARY	All right, Jabez ...

MARY	Jabez -- Jabez!
JABEZ	Mary!





































SHERIFF	Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
JABEZ	It's all right, Sheriff.
SHERIFF	Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
JABEZ	Let him try it.
SHERIFF	The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.

JABEZ	Hello, Sheriff.
SHERIFF	Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
JABEZ	And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.

SHERIFF	It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
JABEZ	Very well, folks. I accept.

JABEZ	Come in, Sheriff.
SHERIFF	Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
JABEZ	Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.

MARY	You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
MA STONE	Mary -- Jabez --
MARY	Coming, Ma.

MA STONE	Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
MARY	I guess we won't.

MARY	That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
MA STONE	Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.

MA STONE	Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
MARY	Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.

MARY	I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
MA STONE	H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.

MARY	You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
MA STONE	Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?

MARY	What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
MA STONE	The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
MARY	What mountain?

MA STONE	Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
MARY	Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --

MA STONE	She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
MARY	Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.

MA STONE	Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
MARY	Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
MA STONE	Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
MARY	Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
MA STONE	What's that?
MARY	I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!

MA STONE	So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
MARY	You aren't angry with me?
MA STONE	Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.

MA STONE	Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
MARY	I won't forget.

WEBSTER	What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
MARTIN	Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
WEBSTER	Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
MARTIN	Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
WEBSTER	Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
MARTIN	Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --

MARY	It is.
WEBSTER	You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
MARY	-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.

WEBSTER	Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
MARY	No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
WEBSTER	Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
MARY	Of course not --
WEBSTER	No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
MARY	Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
WEBSTER	Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
MARY	Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
WEBSTER	I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
MARY	Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
WEBSTER	You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
MARY	You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
WEBSTER	Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
MARY	Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
WEBSTER	And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!

MARY	Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
WEBSTER	Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.

MARY	Jabez ...
WEBSTER	Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
MARY	Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
WEBSTER	I'll do my best, Mary.

WEBSTER	There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
MARY	She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.

OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE	Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
WEBSTER	Hullooo!
OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE	Someone to see you, Dan'l!
WEBSTER	If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE	Just someone from New Hampshire!
WEBSTER	Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.

SCRATCH	It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
WEBSTER	Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
SCRATCH	With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
WEBSTER	I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
SCRATCH	I'll be there, too!

WEBSTER	Say, that's pretty good, young man.
SCRATCH	Pretty good -- that's perfect!

SCRATCH	Mr. Webster, I presume?
WEBSTER	Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
SCRATCH	Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?

WEBSTER	Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
SCRATCH	It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
WEBSTER	Me?
SCRATCH	Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
WEBSTER	There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
SCRATCH	Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
WEBSTER	Cup for cup!

SCRATCH	Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
WEBSTER	Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
SCRATCH	There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
WEBSTER	H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
SCRATCH	Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
WEBSTER	Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
SCRATCH	And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
WEBSTER	Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
SCRATCH	You mean -- a jury trial?
WEBSTER	I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
SCRATCH	Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
WEBSTER	Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
SCRATCH	The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
WEBSTER	I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!

SCRATCH	Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
WEBSTER	I object.

SCRATCH	My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
WEBSTER	Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...

STEVENS	I wanted to give it all to the church.
SCRATCH	My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
STEVENS	That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
SCRATCH	The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
STEVENS	I want someone to talk to ...
SCRATCH	You can talk to me ...
STEVENS	No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
SCRATCH	Why don't you?
STEVENS	I can't be honest with them.
SCRATCH	Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.

CALE	No, I'm not it.
HARRY	Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
CALE	I have five kids at home, I know how it works. I'm just not "it". Okay guys? Two fifty.

HARRY	You're it.
CALE	Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.

CALE	Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
HARRY	Actually we have something for you.

HARRY	Oh my god, are you alright?
CALE	Yeah, I think.

CHING CHONG	But I came here to learn about America.
TURK	Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
CHING CHONG	Then I'm in. Just like Jerk-Off.

CHING CHONG	Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
TURK	She's saying... a beautiful swan...
CHING CHONG	Sleeeeew sheek baw...
TURK	... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.

CHING CHONG	Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
TURK	... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.

TURK	I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
CHING CHONG	I'll tell you why!

TURK	CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
CHING CHONG	Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.

JESSICA	Hi.
HARRY	Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
JESSICA	Excuse me.
HARRY	In the new library there.
JESSICA	Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
HARRY	Depends how you define 'new'...
JESSICA	You're the kid who was home schooled.
HARRY	Yeah. How'd you know?
JESSICA	I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
HARRY	Four colors? Neato!
JESSICA	Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
HARRY	HARRY Dunne.

JESSICA	Hey guys.
HARRY	Heddo Jeth-ica.

HARRY	Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
JESSICA	Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.

HARRY	Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
JESSICA	A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.

JESSICA	HARRY!
HARRY	MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
JESSICA	That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
HARRY	A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
JESSICA	You did?
HARRY	Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
JESSICA	Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
HARRY	Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
JESSICA	Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
HARRY	We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
JESSICA	You and Lloyd chose the class!?

HARRY	Excuse me?
JESSICA	Come over around seven.
HARRY	O'clock?
JESSICA	Yeah...
HARRY	Gotcha.

JESSICA	Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
HARRY	Ooh gross.
JESSICA	Would you like something to drink?
HARRY	Yeah, but I'm buying.

JESSICA	Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
HARRY	Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
JESSICA	I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
HARRY	That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
JESSICA	LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
HARRY	She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
JESSICA	Sit down, I have something to tell you.
HARRY	I'm fine.
JESSICA	Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.

JESSICA	What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
HARRY	Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
JESSICA	Just down the hall.
HARRY	Very good. Back in a jiff.

JESSICA	HARRY? Are you okay?
HARRY	Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
JESSICA	My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
HARRY	Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
JESSICA	What?
HARRY	Coming.

JESSICA	What are you wearing?
HARRY	I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?

HARRY	Okay.
JESSICA	Okay, what?

HARRY	Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
JESSICA	What? No! Look.

HARRY	Hey look, it's our teacher.
JESSICA	Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.

JESSICA'S DAD	Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
HARRY	Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!

JESSICA'S DAD	The name's Walter.
HARRY	Well la de da.

JESSICA'S DAD	We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
HARRY	No, I'm fine thanks.
JESSICA'S DAD	Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
HARRY	Famous? I've never heard of it.

HARRY	Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
MRS. DUNNE	Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
HARRY	I'm just not ready.

HARRY	Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
MRS. DUNNE	It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
HARRY	Wow just like Marco Polo.
MRS. DUNNE	I don't follow.
HARRY	You know Mom, like in the pool.

MRS. DUNNE	You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
HARRY	I know I am, Mom.
MRS. DUNNE	Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
HARRY	Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!

HARRY	Mom, you know that never works.
MRS. DUNNE	Right.

MRS. DUNNE	Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
HARRY	Is it okay if he spends the night?
MRS. DUNNE	LLOYD, did you ask your parents?

MRS. DUNNE	Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
HARRY	Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
MRS. DUNNE	So boys, how was your first day?

LLOYD	You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
HARRY	That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
LLOYD	Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
HARRY	Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
LLOYD	No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
HARRY	Probably because we've never met.
LLOYD	No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
HARRY	Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
LLOYD	I haven't seen you around here before.
HARRY	Home school. Til today.
LLOYD	Home school? What's that?
HARRY	I go to school where I live.
LLOYD	Me too!

HARRY	I think it's just over there.
LLOYD	Is that what I think it is?
HARRY	No, it's a treasure map.
LLOYD	Cool.
HARRY	My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
LLOYD	I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
HARRY	What?
LLOYD	You're it.

LLOYD	Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
HARRY	Don't we want them to talk to us?
LLOYD	No no no no no.
HARRY	Why not?
LLOYD	Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
HARRY	No.

HARRY	Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
LLOYD	How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
HARRY	Me too!

LLOYD	You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
HARRY	Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
LLOYD	Yeah, he's aces.  Thanks, Turk!

HARRY	God, she's beautiful. My wiener's all tingly.
LLOYD	Shift to your left.

HARRY	Who's Principal Collins?
LLOYD	The principal.
HARRY	Wow.

LLOYD	You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
HARRY	Oh, is this your special place?
LLOYD	No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
HARRY	Can we eat there tomorrow?
LLOYD	Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
HARRY	It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.

LLOYD	H A R R Y...
HARRY	The second R is silent.
LLOYD	Oh, of course.

HARRY	One day they'll find a cure.
LLOYD	You brave soldier.

HARRY	We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
LLOYD	And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.

HARRY	...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
LLOYD	HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.

HARRY	Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
LLOYD	Now that's more of what we're looking for.

HARRY	Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the class.
LLOYD	JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.

LLOYD	Got any crazy eights?
HARRY	Go fish.

HARRY	Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
LLOYD	Who's Captain Rob?
HARRY	Just a guy I hang out with.
LLOYD	I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
HARRY	No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
LLOYD	Sounds like a pirate.
HARRY	What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
LLOYD	Yeah, he's a pirate.
HARRY	I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
LLOYD	Peg leg?
HARRY	Yeah, go-cart accident.
LLOYD	Exactly! A pirate!
HARRY	If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
LLOYD	A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!

LLOYD	Whoa. What was that?
HARRY	What?
LLOYD	Your mom made a move on me.
HARRY	She did not.
LLOYD	Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
HARRY	LLOYD, she's my mom.
LLOYD	I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
HARRY	Will not.
LLOYD	Don't use that tone with me, young man.
HARRY	Shut up!
LLOYD	I will stop this car right now.
HARRY	You're not my real dad.
LLOYD	You take that back!
HARRY	Shut Up! Buttlick!
LLOYD	Where did you learn that word?
HARRY	I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
LLOYD	Kids.

LLOYD	That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
HARRY	Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.

HARRY	Collins is a great man!
LLOYD	Now you see why he was elected principal?

HARRY	HARRY.
LLOYD	You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
HARRY	No.
LLOYD	Okay. Anyone else have any questions?

HARRY	What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
LLOYD	Don't look directly at him.

HARRY	...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
LLOYD	The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
HARRY	I didn't know that.
LLOYD	Welcome to public school, my friend.
HARRY	Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
LLOYD	When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
HARRY	A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
LLOYD	And he invented fire.

HARRY	Nice jugs.
LLOYD	They can't be real.

LLOYD	You're it.
HARRY	Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.

HARRY	You're it.
LLOYD	Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?

HARRY	Can he do that?
LLOYD	HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.

HARRY	These are really cold, huh?
LLOYD	That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.

HARRY	Owww... refreshing.
LLOYD	Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?

HARRY	I don't know. Owwww.
LLOYD	Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.

HARRY	My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it's from all the learning today.
LLOYD	Put some ice on it.

HARRY	Owww.
LLOYD	And my mouph is frozen.

HARRY	There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
LLOYD	What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.

HARRY	LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
LLOYD	Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
HARRY	...cause you said...
LLOYD	HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
HARRY	Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
LLOYD	HARRY! Here he comes.

LLOYD	According to the map, we're just about at school.
HARRY	Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.

HARRY	What?
LLOYD	Our own special bus.
HARRY	How do you know it's for us?
LLOYD	Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!

LLOYD	Nope. I was right.
HARRY	Wanna bet?

HARRY	Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
LLOYD	Sucks for you.
HARRY	Who's your partner?
LLOYD	I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
HARRY	Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
LLOYD	You and me? Dream on, desperado.
HARRY	Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
LLOYD	I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.

LLOYD	That's a cow, Harry.
HARRY	Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.

LLOYD	Sorry about that Harry, first time I've brought a friend up there. You okay?
HARRY	Yea!

LLOYD	Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
HARRY	I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
LLOYD	Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
HARRY	Some what?
LLOYD	You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
HARRY	Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
LLOYD	Sure I do. On one condition.
HARRY	You can't marry my mom.
LLOYD	It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
HARRY	Shut up!
LLOYD	Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.

HARRY	Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
LLOYD	Just wanted to see how your doing.
HARRY	I kinda screwed things up.
LLOYD	I'm sure you're overreacting.
HARRY	I don't think so.
LLOYD	You're always your harshest critic.
HARRY	She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
LLOYD	Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
HARRY	Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.

LLOYD	HARRY, can you hear me?
HARRY	Yes.

LLOYD	You have beautiful eyes.
HARRY	You have beautiful eyes.

LLOYD	Hey, where did you come from?
HARRY	Hey, where did you come from?

HARRY	Do you want me to pet your head?
LLOYD	I bet you want your head scratched.
HARRY	I bet you want your head scratched.

LLOYD	Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
HARRY	Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.

LLOYD	Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
HARRY	What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?

HARRY	Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
LLOYD	So, have you given him "some" yet? 

HARRY	LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
LLOYD	HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you leave - before I imagine something horrible.
HARRY	But-
LLOYD	HARRY!
HARRY	You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.

LLOYD	HARRY! I found the treasure!
HARRY	Go away, assface.
LLOYD	Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
HARRY	Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
LLOYD	JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
HARRY	Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
LLOYD	Captain Rob came back?
HARRY	Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
LLOYD	Hey, there's no reason to use that kind of language!
HARRY	Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
LLOYD	Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.

LLOYD	HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
HARRY	You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.

LLOYD	No one knows?
HARRY	Me, me, me!
LLOYD	The answer is George Jefferson.

LLOYD	By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
HARRY	No. What happened?
LLOYD	Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?

LLOYD	A raft.
HARRY	A blimp.
LLOYD	A turd.

LLOYD	George Washington!
HARRY	Who?
LLOYD	Hello, he only invented money!

LLOYD	Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
HARRY	What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".

LLOYD	If you have to ask, you don't know.
HARRY	Yeah, that's why I asked.
LLOYD	You certainly did.
HARRY	I know I did.
LLOYD	Sorry, no further questions.

HARRY	You're it.
LLOYD	Am not.
HARRY	Are, too.
LLOYD	D2.

HARRY	It's okay. I want the rush.
LLOYD	No. Look.

HARRY	Hey, it's Jessica.
LLOYD	That must be her boyfriend's car.

HARRY	PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!
LLOYD	Now it makes total sense why she didn't want him to know we were in his office the other night.

HARRY	No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
LLOYD	He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
HARRY	Hey, let's go spy on them.

HARRY	Cute puppy.
LLOYD	He must be on his way to pee out a fire.

HARRY	Hey, look. Ice cream.
LLOYD	You thinking what I'm thinking?

HARRY	You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
LLOYD	Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
HARRY	Well, I'm listening now.
LLOYD	Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.

HARRY	You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
LLOYD	How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
HARRY	But my mom gave me the map.
LLOYD	I lugged it all over town!
HARRY	I made the polar bear pants.
LLOYD	But I ate your Mom's pie.
HARRY	I... found that rock.
LLOYD	It was a diamond and you swallowed it.

LLOYD	Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
HARRY	I don't know who we are anymore.

LLOYD	I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
HARRY	Do you know what this means?

HARRY	Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
LLOYD	Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.

LLOYD	That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
HARRY	That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.

HARRY	What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
LLOYD	Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
HARRY	Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.

HARRY	What? What did we do?
LLOYD	We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
HARRY	That's what Jessica was talking about!
LLOYD	She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
HARRY	And like she said, do it before the parade.

LLOYD	A float!
HARRY	That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!

LLOYD	HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
HARRY	Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.

HARRY	Ready Lloyd?
LLOYD	Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.

HARRY	Wait, wait!
LLOYD	HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
HARRY	LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.

HARRY	Guys, this is much better.
LLOYD	PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.

HARRY	Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
LLOYD	Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
HARRY	You're a great teacher, Lloyd.

HARRY	Start the tape, Lloyd.
LLOYD	Roger that, Wilco.

HARRY	Oh, good. There's Jessica.
LLOYD	How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.

HARRY	Hey there goes Principal Collins!
LLOYD	He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
HARRY	Well, that's too bad, this is his day.

HARRY	Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
LLOYD	And with that complete loser

LLOYD	Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
HARRY	Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
LLOYD	I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.

LLOYD	Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
HARRY	Right.
LLOYD	Okay. Which one do you want?

HARRY	The one on the left.
LLOYD	Damn! What are the odds?
HARRY	What?
LLOYD	That's the one I wanted.

HARRY	She's one of a kind.
LLOYD	Try one in a million!
HARRY	Well, what should we do?

LLOYD	You take her.
HARRY	No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.

HARRY	Sorry, Charlie.
LLOYD	Hey, where'd you go?

HARRY	Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
LLOYD	That's gross.
HARRY	I know.

JESSICA	MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
MS. HELLER	I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
JESSICA	Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
MS. HELLER	Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
JESSICA	So can I come along?
MS. HELLER	No.

JESSICA	Are you wearing a coconut bra?
MS. HELLER	Oh, you're good.
JESSICA	Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
MS. HELLER	Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
JESSICA	You mean the lunch room?

MS. HELLER	I thought I told you to get lost.
JESSICA	Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
MS. HELLER	I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS	You had some questions.
JESSICA	Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
JESSICA	I don't know what you're talking about.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Oh I think you do.

JESSICA	My parents are going to wonder where I am.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.

JESSICA	So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Not to expect you tonight.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS	I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
JESSICA	I don't know what you're talking about.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
JESSICA	That's not your tape.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Then where did you get this not my tape.
JESSICA	THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Don't play with me dear, you're way out of your league.

JESSICA	TURK, leave him alone.
TURK	TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.

JESSICA	TURK, what are you doing here?
TURK	Special Needs class.
JESSICA	Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
TURK	You're just jealous.
JESSICA	And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.

LLOYD	Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
JESSICA	I'll talk to you later.

JESSICA	HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
LLOYD	If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
JESSICA	Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.

LLOYD	Why ith dat newth?
JESSICA	This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.

JESSICA	Yes, what?
LLOYD	Don't answer me. Say what I say.

JESSICA	Well I was born in St. Louis.
LLOYD	Do you want me to pet your head?

JESSICA	What are you doing here?
LLOYD	Checking up on my friend, Harry.
JESSICA	Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.

JESSICA	What?
LLOYD	You know, "some". The fag stuff.
JESSICA	HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
LLOYD	I know, you want go for a ride.

JESSICA	Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
LLOYD	Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
JESSICA	So could you get us into the principal's office?
LLOYD	Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.

JESSICA	So, when can we do it?
LLOYD	Tomorrow night?

JESSICA	Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
LLOYD	Oh, go on.

JESSICA	Well, something stinks.
LLOYD	Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
JESSICA	Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
LLOYD	So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?

LLOYD	What are you doing?
JESSICA	Let's just do it and get out of here.

JESSICA	I'm so close I can feel it.
LLOYD	Me too. I'm almost there.
JESSICA	That's it. I'm done.
LLOYD	That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
JESSICA	No, it was a complete waste of time.
LLOYD	This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.

JESSICA	That's my boyfriend.
LLOYD	Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
JESSICA	Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn't find what I was looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can't know we were here.

JESSICA	HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
LLOYD	Looks like the best man won.

LLOYD	... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
JESSICA	LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
LLOYD	HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.

JESSICA	Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
LLOYD	My dream date with Principal Collins.

JESSICA	He's going to be in jail for a long time.
LLOYD	Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.

LEWIS	Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
LLOYD	You were born free and free you should remain.

LLOYD	Do I know you?
LEWIS	Duh. I'm in your class at school.
LLOYD	Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
LEWIS	I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
LLOYD	You really are a pirate.
LEWIS	Can you believe it?
LLOYD	So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
LEWIS	What are you talking about?

LLOYD	Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
TOBY	Skateboard.

TOBY	What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
LLOYD	Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.

TOBY	How much homework is there?
LLOYD	That's the downside. There is none.
TOBY	Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
LLOYD	You can bring whatever you want, little friend.

TEN YEAR-OLD KID	Sure.
LLOYD	Go in there and get us two slushees.
TEN YEAR-OLD KID	Okay.
LLOYD	Do we have a deal?
TEN YEAR-OLD KID	Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
LLOYD	Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
TEN YEAR-OLD KID	Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
LLOYD	Uh-oh. Harry?

LLOYD	Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
MRS. DUNNE	He passed away three years ago.
LLOYD	Well he missed a great pot of stew!
MRS. DUNNE	It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
LLOYD	I liked it a lot.

MRS. DUNNE	Hey you two. Lights out.
LLOYD	Hey can be on top?

LLOYD	Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
MRS. DUNNE	Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
LLOYD	Have you got what I want?
MRS. DUNNE	You know I do!
LLOYD	Oh yeah, give it to me.

MRS. DUNNE	How was that?
LLOYD	It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...

RAY	Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
LLOYD	Thanks, Pop.

RAY	LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
LLOYD	Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!

RAY	What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
LLOYD	We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
RAY	My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
LLOYD	So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
RAY	I reckon so.

MS. HELLER	Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
LLOYD	Will that be on the midterm?
MS. HELLER	No.

LLOYD	Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
MS. HELLER	People! Come on. "Parade" float.

MS. HELLER	That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
LLOYD	Or maybe crossing a river!

LLOYD	Obviously.
MS. HELLER	So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?

MS. HELLER	Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
MARGIE	Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.

MS. HELLER	Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
MARGIE	Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
MS. HELLER	What?
MARGIE	He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
MS. HELLER	Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!

MS. HELLER	That's great, now make a left, then straight!
MARGIE	Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.

MS. HELLER	Left here! Left!
MARGIE	You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.

MS. HELLER	Ha! Too big to make the turn!
MARGIE	No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.

MS. HELLER	I think you did it.
MARGIE	Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
MS. HELLER	What the hell are you talking about?

ZIMMER	I'm not sure if I can do this.
MOFFIT	Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
ZIMMER	Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
MOFFIT	I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
ZIMMER	Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
MOFFIT	Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.

MOFFIT	I am strong!
ZIMMER	Yes you are. 

MOFFIT	I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
ZIMMER	But we don't drink from the house do we.

MS. HELLER	... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.

MS. HELLER	God, I've missed you.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	And I you.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS	You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
MS. HELLER	How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.

MS. HELLER	It's the big potato.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
MS. HELLER	Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
MS. HELLER	We start our own class?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.

MS. HELLER	You said "aloha" twice.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Aloha means hello and goodbye.
MS. HELLER	Oh wow. Look at you.

MS. HELLER	Times two.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	I think you'll make a good teacher.

MS. HELLER	To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Yes!

PRINCIPAL COLLINS	So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
MS. HELLER	And...?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	And, take some more pictures.
MS. HELLER	Wow, you are smart.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	And you are great in bed.

MS. HELLER	Knock knock.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Who's there?
MS. HELLER	Guess what"s under these coconuts.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	What?
MS. HELLER	It's a surprise.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Well I've got a little surprise for you.
MS. HELLER	You got the Extender?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
MS. HELLER	Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.

MS. HELLER	So what do you keep in there?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
MS. HELLER	Everything?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Everything. Just for the record.

MS. HELLER	Oh, just like the President.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Just like the President.

MS. HELLER	Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
MS. HELLER	What papers?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
MS. HELLER	The evidence of what?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.

MS. HELLER	Where is it?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
MS. HELLER	Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.

MS. HELLER	It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	JESSICA. Are you sure?
MS. HELLER	She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
MS. HELLER	Are you going to kill her?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.

MS. HELLER	So the chest is still out there somewhere.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
MS. HELLER	This band sounds terrible.

PRINCIPAL COLLINS	I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
MS. HELLER	Love it!
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.

MS. HELLER	This is horse?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS	No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.

FORD	But I ain't got you...
BAND	But I ain't got you...
FORD	No, I ain't got you...
BAND	No, I ain't got you...
FORD	I said, I ain't got you...
BAND	I said, I ain't got you...
FORD	I ain't -- got -- you.

COLLEEN	Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
FORD	Don't say it.  Orange juice?
COLLEEN	Please.

FORD	Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
COLLEEN	Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
FORD	I don't know, I never met your father.

FORD	Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
COLLEEN	Who's your decorator?
FORD	Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
COLLEEN	Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
FORD	Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
COLLEEN	I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.

FORD	Now that we've broken the ice...
COLLEEN	I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
FORD	Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
COLLEEN	But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...

FORD	No thanks.  I carry my own.
COLLEEN	Excuse me?
FORD	Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.

COLLEEN	Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
FORD	Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
COLLEEN	Actually, you may take it all now.
FORD	Oh... I have some questions.
COLLEEN	I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.

FORD	Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
COLLEEN	Who?
FORD	Nuthin'.

COLLEEN	My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
FORD	Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
COLLEEN	Uh, let's go sit down.

COLLEEN	So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
FORD	I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.

FORD	Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
COLLEEN	So you...
FORD	Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
COLLEEN	Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
FORD	They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
COLLEEN	I'll do my best.
FORD	Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.

COLLEEN	Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
FORD	Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.

COLLEEN	I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
FORD	I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
COLLEEN	Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
FORD	Have what?
COLLEEN	Did she tell you anything?
FORD	Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
COLLEEN	Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...

COLLEEN	Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
FORD	But I am...

FORD	What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
COLLEEN	We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
FORD	Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?

COLLEEN	That was close...
FORD	What did these Vancouver factories do?

COLLEEN	Art Mo-o-o-ney!
FORD	Thanks, I needed that.

FORD	So many assholes, so few bullets.
DON	Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
FORD	I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
DON	Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...

DON	You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
FORD	I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...

DON	I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
FORD	Great pipes.

FORD	I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
DON	Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.

DON	Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
FORD	I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.

FORD	Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
DON	Right away!

FORD	Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
DON	Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...

DON	Thanks for the promotion, man.
FORD	No prob...

FORD	Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
JAZZ	Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
FORD	All your friends call you Jazz.
JAZZ	Exactly.

JAZZ	You wish.
FORD	Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.

FORD	I do it for love.
JAZZ	'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.

JAZZ	G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
FORD	Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
JAZZ	Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
FORD	Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
JAZZ	You're saying you need money.
FORD	Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
JAZZ	Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...

JAZZ	You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
FORD	I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?

JAZZ	That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
FORD	Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.

JAZZ	So what about this watch?
FORD	Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.

FORD	Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
JAZZ	I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?

FORD	Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
JAZZ	Spooky.  I'll process her.
FORD	Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.

FORD	Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
JAZZ	You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
FORD	This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...

FORD	You going to be okay?
JAZZ	Go on, 'they're stahting.'

FORD	And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
JAZZ	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.

FORD	Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
JAZZ	Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.

FORD	How'd you get this from her?
JAZZ	You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
FORD	A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
JAZZ	No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
FORD	I wish I knew.  You did good work...
JAZZ	Make eye contact when you say that.
FORD	I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
JAZZ	Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.

FORD	What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
JAZZ	Contacts.
FORD	I like.

FORD	I don't know, what was the case?
JAZZ	Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.
FORD	Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.

JAZZ	She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
FORD	Yeah, let's bury her.
JAZZ	Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.

JAZZ	You okay?
FORD	Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
JAZZ	Who?

JAZZ	Ah, an obvious choice.
FORD	Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.

JAZZ	Hello, Ford...
FORD	What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.

JAZZ	I came to warn you...
FORD	Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!

JAZZ	I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
FORD	I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...

FORD	Aha, just what I suspected!
JAZZ	You're not funny.

JAZZ	Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
FORD	Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...

FORD	Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
JAZZ	Johnny's C.D.?

FORD	What an interface!
JAZZ	Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
FORD	Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
JAZZ	C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
FORD	Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
JAZZ	But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.

FORD	After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
JAZZ	I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s

JAZZ	I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
FORD	Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
JAZZ	Wha --

SLEAZY GUY	Got those Vomit invites here...
FORD	Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
SLEAZY GUY	Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
FORD	How much?
SLEAZY GUY	Three hundred.
FORD	You gave it to the girls for one.
SLEAZY GUY	Hey, they blew me.
FORD	Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.

FORD	Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
ZUZU	I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.

FORD	A simple 'please' would suffice...
ZUZU	Fluck you!

ZUZU	It's red, Ford.
FORD	What?

ZUZU	Hello?
FORD	Give me your gum and grab the wheel.

FORD	You okay?
ZUZU	Peachy.

FORD	Let's get serious...
ZUZU	Why are all these people after me?
FORD	Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
ZUZU	I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...

FORD	You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
ZUZU	I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
FORD	What?  Jesus, tell me!
ZUZU	It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!

ZUZU	Spunk, come back...
FORD	How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
ZUZU	Because I know rock-n-roll.
FORD	You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
ZUZU	Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.

FORD	Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
ZUZU	No.  Who's Art Mooney?
FORD	He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...

ZUZU	Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
FORD	Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
ZUZU	You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?

ZUZU	Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
FORD	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
ZUZU	What a perv...

ZUZU	Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
FORD	People still watch that?
ZUZU	Who cares about people?

FORD	Zuzu, wake up...
ZUZU	Hah fluck, great video, huh?
FORD	Are you okay?
ZUZU	Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.

FORD	My axe!
ZUZU	Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?

ZUZU	I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
FORD	Ye-ah.  Sure.

ZUZU	This is boring, guys.
FORD	Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.

ZUZU	Ford, you were right!
FORD	Ye-ah.

FORD	I'm afraid so, you want her?
ZUZU	But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.

ZUZU	Nice left you got there, jerk.
FORD	Sorry, it was dark, now come on.

ZUZU	This way...
FORD	No, wait...

ZUZU	Suck a dick, I left my purse...
FORD	As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
ZUZU	Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
FORD	Ye-ah.

FORD	Pretty smooth, huh?
ZUZU	Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
FORD	Why have you come to my planet?

ZUZU	Ick.
FORD	I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?

FORD	Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
ZUZU	Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.

FORD	I can't kill this kid's father...
ZUZU	Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
FORD	This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...

ZUZU	Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.
FORD	You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.

FORD	Are you okay?
ZUZU	There's that question...

ZUZU	Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
FORD	ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.

ZUZU	You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
FORD	I'll mail you a letter, come on!

ZUZU	Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
FORD	Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.

FORD	So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
ZUZU	Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.

THE KID	Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
FORD	Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.

THE KID	Gut feeling.
FORD	I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...

THE KID	When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?
FORD	Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.

THE KID	I got something serious to dis-cuss.
FORD	Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
THE KID	Forget it.

THE KID	Ouch.
FORD	Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
THE KID	Who cares?  I got a case.
FORD	Twelve pack?

THE KID	This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
FORD	Did he just say what I think he said?
THE KID	I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.

FORD	Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
THE KID	You need it.
FORD	I don't need it that bad.

THE KID	I'm sorry...
FORD	Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
THE KID	These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
FORD	Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
THE KID	Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
FORD	Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.

THE KID	I tried to help you...!
FORD	And hey, I appreciate it...
THE KID	Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
FORD	Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
THE KID	Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.

THE KID	So, did you find my dad?
FORD	Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
THE KID	Yeah, go on...
FORD	Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...

FORD	It's me.
THE KID	What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
FORD	Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
THE KID	Who's my real father, man?
FORD	He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.

FORD	I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
THE KID	Shut the heck up... Pop.

FORD	Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
LT. AMOS	You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
FORD	You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
LT. AMOS	Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?

LT. AMOS	What are you running from?
FORD	Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
LT. AMOS	If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
FORD	Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
LT. AMOS	Two words.  Disco Express.
FORD	Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
LT. AMOS	'Booty Time.'
FORD	Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
LT. AMOS	Like me.
FORD	I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
LT. AMOS	'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
FORD	You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.

LT. AMOS	Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
FORD	That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
LT. AMOS	God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
FORD	Really?

LT. AMOS	It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
FORD	Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
LT. AMOS	That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.

SMILEY	Polo.
FORD	Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.

SMILEY	Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
FORD	I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
SMILEY	Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
FORD	Fine!
SMILEY	What's fine?
FORD	I'm off it!
SMILEY	Off what?  Twenty seconds...
FORD	The case!
SMILEY	Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
FORD	<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.

FORD	You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
SMILEY	Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
FORD	Say cheese...

FORD	I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
SMILEY	<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
FORD	Okay.  'B-y-e!

SMILEY	How's it going?
FORD	You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
SMILEY	The point?
FORD	Let me go out like a man.
SMILEY	Anyway you want it, asshole.

FORD	How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
GRENDEL	Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...

GRENDEL	Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
FORD	Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
GRENDEL	Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.

FORD	I knew your father.  He was quite...
GRENDEL	An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.

GRENDEL	Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
FORD	I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?

GRENDEL	Well, hello, Ford.
FORD	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
GRENDEL	I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.

GRENDEL	So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
FORD	Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
GRENDEL	Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...

FORD	Jazz, we're talking here.
GRENDEL	Go on, another time, another place.

FORD	Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
GRENDEL	Shock.
FORD	And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
GRENDEL	Golly, I'd probably faint.

GRENDEL	Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!
FORD	Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
GRENDEL	Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.

GRENDEL	It doesn't have to be like this?
FORD	Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!

FORD	<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
GRENDEL	It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
FORD	Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?

FORD	I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
GRENDEL	I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
FORD	What about Don?
GRENDEL	Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.

GRENDEL	Kill them.  Not quickly.
FORD	Are you okay?

FORD	When I say 'no,' run for the door.
GRENDEL	Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.

FORD	Shit.
GRENDEL	Ciao.

FORD	You'd said something about proof...
GRENDEL	Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --

FORD	And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
GRENDEL	Fuck me...
FORD	Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
GRENDEL	When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
FORD	Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
GRENDEL	What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?

FORD	Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
GRENDEL	Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.

GRENDEL	I'm still the king!
FORD	Julian, you're fired.

MELODI	You're that guy, the private eye.
FORD	You're a poet and didn't know it.
MELODI	Do you really know everybody in the industry?
FORD	Only on a first name basis.
MELODI	That's cute.  You're funny.
FORD	That's funny, you're cute.
MELODI	You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
FORD	I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.

MELODI	Hi, private eye guy!
FORD	Hey, the poet...

MELODI	Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
FORD	Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.

MELODI	This isn't music!
FORD	It is to us!  It's computerised.

FORD	I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
JOHNNY	Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
FORD	Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
JOHNNY	I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
FORD	Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.

FORD	How nice.
JOHNNY	It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
FORD	'Bye, Johnny...
JOHNNY	What?

JOHNNY	So...
FORD	I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
JOHNNY	Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.

JOHNNY	I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
FORD	Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
JOHNNY	I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.

CORT	I thought that was the end of the song.
JILL	Great.  Just great.

JILL	If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
CORT	Who's Horace?
JILL	My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.

CORT	What?
JILL	Go out and plug the cord back in.
CORT	What?  Who pulled it out?!

JILL	Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
CORT	Alright, alright.

JILL	That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
CORT	No way...  ...I wanna rock!

DARREN	Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
LIZBETH	Well, who told me to take this cow path?
DARREN	You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
LIZBETH	I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.

LIZBETH	Darren, we better turn around.
DARREN	Why?
LIZBETH	Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.

DARREN	Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
LIZBETH	We're gonna scare him?!

DARREN	That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
LIZBETH	That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
DARREN	Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.

DARREN	Oh, jeez.
LIZBETH	That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.

DARREN	Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
LIZBETH	Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.

SHERIFF	It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
DEPUTY	He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
SHERIFF	But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.

SHERIFF	I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
DEPUTY	Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
SHERIFF	Better call an ambulance first.

SHERIFF	Is that all you found?
DEPUTY	I wish it was.

SHERIFF	Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
DEPUTY	He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
SHERIFF	Whaddya mean?
DEPUTY	Happy Friday the 13th.

SHERIFF	You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
DEPUTY	Sheriff, you better take this.

KATIE	....with a woman's touch.
STAN	Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
KATIE	See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.

KATIE	Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
STAN	You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
KATIE	Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
STAN	Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.

STAN	Ahh, nothing.
KATIE	I could swear I heard...

STAN	Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
LARRY	This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
STAN	That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
LARRY	My ass.
STAN	Yeah, that's fat too.

LARRY	You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
STAN	This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...

LARRY	Never should've let her play.
STAN	It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.

MEGAN	Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
SHERIFF	Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.

MEGAN	Jason who?
SHERIFF	Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.

MEGAN	But, Dad, we...
SHERIFF	Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.

MEGAN	When are you going to stop treating me like one!
SHERIFF	When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
MEGAN	How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
SHERIFF	You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.

MEGAN	What it is?
SHERIFF	Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
MEGAN	I thought Jason was only a legend?
SHERIFF	He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.

SHERIFF	...And I said, shut up!
MEGAN	All he's asking is for you to check it out.

MEGAN	Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
SHERIFF	We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.

SHERIFF	Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
MEGAN	Daddy, what is going on?
SHERIFF	And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.

MEGAN	No.  No, it's not...
SHERIFF	Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...

TOMMY	Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
MEGAN	Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
TOMMY	I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...

TOMMY	What?
MEGAN	Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.

MEGAN	Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
TOMMY	Uh...yes.  But...
MEGAN	Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.

MEGAN	You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
TOMMY	Okay.  There's one.

MEGAN	It's all over.
TOMMY	It's just beginning.

TOMMY	So what are ya drawin'?
MEGAN	What's it to ya?

MEGAN	There...Ya happy?
TOMMY	No.
MEGAN	Why?
TOMMY	'Cause it stinks.

MEGAN	Okay, give it back.
TOMMY	Come and get it.

TOMMY	Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
MEGAN	Wait a minute. I just...
TOMMY	I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.

MEGAN	Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
TOMMY	It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
MEGAN	Lake Forest Green?
TOMMY	Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.

MEGAN	They did show up.  Isn't that great?
TOMMY	I hope so.

TOMMY	Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
MEGAN	Did you hear me?!
TOMMY	Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.

PAULA	So what happened?
NANCY	There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.

PAULA	You mean you had a bad dream.
NANCY	No, he was real.  Like on TV.

PAULA	Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
NANCY	Nancy.
PAULA	Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...

PAULA	...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
NANCY	No more.

PAULA	Where'd you get this?
NANCY	I found it outside.

PAULA	You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
NANCY	Why?
PAULA	Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
NANCY	Are they grown-ups?
PAULA	That's debatable.
NANCY	Huh?

PAULA	I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
NANCY	Who ya calling?

NANCY	But what if they try and scare us?
PAULA	We'll scare 'em right back.

PAULA	I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
NANCY	But what I get scared again?
PAULA	Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?

PAULA	It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
SISSY	All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.

PAULA	So where's Cort gone off to?
SISSY	Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
PAULA	Which is?
SISSY	Boy scouting.
PAULA	You gotta be kidding!

SISSY	Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
PAULA	Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
SISSY	Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
PAULA	No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
SISSY	Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...

PAULA	Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
SISSY	Yeah, we're here.

PAULA	I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
SISSY	I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
PAULA	He didn't say anything?
SISSY	Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."

PAULA	What's goin' on?
SISSY	I think somebody's messin' around out there.

SHERIFF	Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
TOMMY	Will you listen, dammit!
SHERIFF	Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.

TOMMY	Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
SHERIFF	Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
TOMMY	Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...

SHERIFF	Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
TOMMY	Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
SHERIFF	And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
TOMMY	Yes, but they released me because...

SHERIFF	No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
TOMMY	There's no time for this bullshit...

TOMMY	Why didn't you cremate him?!
SHERIFF	They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...

TOMMY	If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
SHERIFF	Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
TOMMY	You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
SHERIFF	You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.

SHERIFF	I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
TOMMY	I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.

TOMMY	Yes!
SHERIFF	No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.

SHERIFF	I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
TOMMY	But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.

TOMMY	I gotta show you Jason's grave.
SHERIFF	I've seen it.
TOMMY	Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.

SHERIFF	Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
TOMMY	Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!

SHERIFF	With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
TOMMY	Please don't do anything crazy.

TOMMY	You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
SHERIFF	If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.

TOMMY	Doesn't that tell you something?!
SHERIFF	Yeah...They should've paid their bill.

PIXEL	Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...
ADAM	I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.

PIXEL	Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
ADAM	About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...

ADAM	Why are you...don't stop...why?
PIXEL	Why? If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!

ADAM	It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
PIXEL	Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
ADAM	Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
PIXEL	Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
ADAM	But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
PIXEL	And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
ADAM	That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
PIXEL	Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
ADAM	Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!

ADAM	You think you're so...but you're just...
PIXEL	That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.

ANDREW	I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
JASPER	Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
ANDREW	You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
JASPER	Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
ANDREW	Did you wait until you were 18?

ANDREW	I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
JASPER	You have no idea. Now run away.

WENDY	Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
DONALD	Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.

WENDY	Now what? What did I do this time?
DONALD	I just wanted to know if you've seen this.

WENDY	Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
DONALD	Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
WENDY	No.
DONALD	That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.

WICHITA	Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
DONALD	Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
WICHITA	Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
DONALD	I'm not really a--Does it count if...

DONALD	Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
WICHITA	They wouldn't be a bit surprised..

WICHITA	Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....

WICHITA	Howdy Pouty.
DONALD	I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
WICHITA	She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
DONALD	You are the prince of the darkness.

WICHITA	I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
DONALD	Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
WICHITA	I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
DONALD	Say Hi for me.

WICHITA	Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
ERIC	Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...

WICHITA	That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
ERIC	Oh thanks, it was nothing...
WICHITA	You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
ERIC	Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...

ERIC	There you are!  Man, I don't know how to thank...
WICHITA	Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
ERIC	Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.

WENDY	What are you doing?
PIXEL	Nothing.

WENDY	You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
PIXEL	When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
WENDY	Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...

PIXEL	Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.

PIXEL	...sorry...
WENDY	This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!

PIXEL	One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
WENDY	Yeah. And?
PIXEL	It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.

WENDY	Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!

WENDY	Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
TALIA	We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?

TALIA	Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
WENDY	Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
TALIA	Yes, it does.

WICHITA	I just never thought of you in that...

WICHITA	I think your passion is terrific.
WENDY	I think your condescension is even better.

WICHITA	We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
WENDY	Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
WICHITA	You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...

WENDY	Do you really not believe in God?
WICHITA	It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...

WENDY	What else don't you believe in?

L293212	u5951	m394	HAWK	Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was Who Shot J.R.?"
ALEX	Maybe we're ragged and funny.

ALEX	Now that's a lock.
HAWK	Don't worry, we'll get it...

HAWK	Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt
ALEX	How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt

HAWK	That was close....
ALEX	Anna, I think you better stay....
HAWK	You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.

ALEX	But we'll be the same as we started...
L293253	u5951	m394	HAWK	We all had our quarrels and parted..."

ALEX	I'm a ghost.  Boo.
HAWK	I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...

HAWK	Alex, are you....
ALEX	I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
HAWK	You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...

ALEX	Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
HAWK	Let's just forget it, I mean...
ALEX	Get em....

ALFRED	Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
HAWK	Too-do-loo, babe.

ALFRED	Welcome to Rome, sir.
HAWK	Yes way.

HAWK	My life is not some deal.  I...
ALFRED	It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.

ALFRED	Welcome back to Vinci.
HAWK	Last rites, sister?

ALFRED	How.
HAWK	You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
ALFRED	My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
HAWK	Ooh-kay...

KAPLAN	Don't you just hate kids...
ALMOND JOY	George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
KAPLAN	I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...

ALMOND JOY	Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
KAPLAN	Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.

ALMOND JOY	With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
KAPLAN	Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....

ALMOND JOY	Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
KAPLAN	As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...

SNICKERS	Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
ALMOND JOY	Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.

SNICKERS	Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
ALMOND JOY	Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
SNICKERS	Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.

SNICKERS	This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
ALMOND JOY	Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...

ALMOND JOY	What the hell....
SNICKERS	You're supposed to be dead!

CARDINAL	Did he mention the Mayflowers?
ANNA	No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
CARDINAL	Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
ANNA	That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
CARDINAL	Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
ANNA	Yeah.  The big E.

CARDINAL	Hit me with your best shot.
ANNA	I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
CARDINAL	Anna, what are you trying to say...
ANNA	He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...

CARDINAL	Messed around messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
ANNA	A little petting is not the issue!
CARDINAL	Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.

ANNA	You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
CARDINAL	Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
ANNA	I'm going to find out.
CARDINAL	I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
ANNA	I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
CARDINAL	God go with you, sister.

HAWK	Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
ANNA	Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.

ANNA	My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
HAWK	Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
ANNA	No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
HAWK	Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.

ANNA	Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
HAWK	Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...

ANNA	Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
HAWK	Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...

ANNA	As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
HAWK	That's what you theenk.
ANNA	Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.

ANNA	Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
HAWK	Never, why do you ask?

HAWK	Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
ANNA	Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
HAWK	Could you believe that crazy elephant?

HAWK	Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
ANNA	Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
HAWK	The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
ANNA	Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
HAWK	Oh, you read that.
ANNA	Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
HAWK	You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
ANNA	I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
HAWK	God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
ANNA	I'll bring my entire repertoire...

HAWK	And I'll bring my entourage...
ANNA	Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
HAWK	Said.

ANNA	Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
HAWK	I never break a date.  Scout's honor.

HAWK	This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
ANNA	Prison?
HAWK	I was the Warden?
ANNA	How long were you in?
HAWK	Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
ANNA	Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
HAWK	I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....

ANNA	What have you been doing?
HAWK	Uh....old badminton injury.

HAWK	tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
ANNA	Oh, I'm so sorry...

ANNA	I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
HAWK	Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
ANNA	It's also been a long time for me.  I--

HAWK	Catholic girls are scary...
ANNA	Somebody robbed the Vatican.
HAWK	Oh.  No.

HAWK	It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
ANNA	You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
HAWK	Wha--
ANNA	What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?

ANNA	For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
HAWK	Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
ANNA	The C.I. what?  God, no...
HAWK	Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...

HAWK	This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
ANNA	Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.

ANNA	Hudson, don't you understand...
HAWK	And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
ANNA	I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
HAWK	Oh.  Well, what's this?

ANNA	Where did you get this?
HAWK	You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
ANNA	It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.

HAWK	You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
ANNA	It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
HAWK	Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
ANNA	You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....

HAWK	Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
ANNA	Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
HAWK	Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.

ANNA	Oh Hudson...
HAWK	I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
ANNA	Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
HAWK	This is too bad to be false.

HAWK	I hope you know what....
ANNA	Trust Leonardo....
HAWK	Wha.....

ANNA	Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
HAWK	Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
ANNA	Wha -- you don't want to know...

HAWK	I wanna know...
ANNA	Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.

HAWK	Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
ANNA	Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
HAWK	I got my planet back.

KAPLAN	Way to go, Anna.
ANNA	When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
KAPLAN	And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?

KAPLAN	It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
ANNA	Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
KAPLAN	Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...

ANNA	Cat got his tongue?
KAPLAN	Actually he never told us what it was.

CESAR	How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
HAWK	Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...

CESAR	You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
HAWK	Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.

CESAR	Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
HAWK	If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.

CESAR	What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
HAWK	Baseball, why?

CESAR	Good job, not pretty, but good.
HAWK	Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?

DARWIN	Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
MINERVA	Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.

DARWIN	Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
MINERVA	That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.

MINERVA	We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
DARWIN	Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
MINERVA	Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!

DARWIN	Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
MINERVA	Like a "cat", one could say.

MINERVA	No, let me!
DARWIN	I don't care.

DARWIN	So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
MINERVA	Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.

DARWIN	Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
MINERVA	Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
DARWIN	Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

DARWIN	I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
MINERVA	We're here to say, your government was right.
DARWIN	So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.

MINERVA	I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
DARWIN	That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
MINERVA	Million five, lover...

DARWIN	For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
HAWK	You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
DARWIN	Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.

DARWIN	So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
HAWK	Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
DARWIN	Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
HAWK	If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
DARWIN	Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
HAWK	I guess that's a no.

DARWIN	Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
HAWK	Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....

DARWIN	I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
HAWK	You want an address on that last one?

DARWIN	What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
HAWK	But you're going to tell us anyway...

GATES	Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
HAWK	The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.

GATES	Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
HAWK	What job?

GATES	The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
HAWK	The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

GATES	You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
HAWK	How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."

GATES	Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
HAWK	Yes.
GATES	Remember that shoe you lost...
HAWK	Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.

HAWK	What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
GATES	That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.

GATES	Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
HAWK	Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?

GATES	All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
HAWK	You certainly do.
GATES	So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?

HAWK	Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
MINERVA	For God's sake, chain this convict.

HAWK	Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
MINERVA	You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
HAWK	You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof.

MINERVA	Get away from there, convict!
HAWK	Just browsing.  Don't touch me....

MINERVA	Big girls don't cry-I-eye.
HAWK	Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.

MINERVA	Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
HAWK	Alchemy.

HAWK	Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
MINERVA	Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!

HAWK	Bunny, not you too?
MINERVA	You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.

MINERVA	I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
HAWK	If you think you're getting past me...

HAWK	You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
MINERVA	It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
HAWK	Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
MINERVA	You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

MINERVA	If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
HAWK	And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
MINERVA	I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.

HAWK	This is the worst night...
SNICKERS	When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.

HAWK	You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
SNICKERS	Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
HAWK	Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!

HAWK	Don't be stupid...they...
SNICKERS	Bastard!  If you were a true American.
HAWK	Just shut up and hit me!

HAWK	Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
SNICKERS	Too bad.

HAWK	Don't I know you...
KAPLAN	You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
HAWK	Bastard, you're going to need another nose!

HAWK	But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
KAPLAN	I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
HAWK	To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.

KAPLAN	I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
HAWK	Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
KAPLAN	Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
HAWK	Employer?  The president?
KAPLAN	No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
HAWK	I'm supposed to fall for that?
KAPLAN	Shucks.  Guess not.

KAPLAN	Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
HAWK	Why George, you big softie...
KAPLAN	God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.

HAWK	Thanks for sharing.
KAPLAN	We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
HAWK	If you do anything to my friend...
KAPLAN	Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.

HAWK	Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
KAPLAN	They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
HAWK	I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.

KAPLAN	I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
HAWK	No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?

HAWK	Why does this have to be so hard...
KAPLAN	Tell me about it...

JACK	Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
BICKERMAN	Oh yes.  I killed him.

JACK	You killed him.
BICKERMAN	Oh, yes.

JACK	He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
BICKERMAN	No.  Do you?

BICKERMAN	You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
JACK	We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
BICKERMAN	You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.

BICKERMAN	Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
KEOUGH	My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
BICKERMAN	Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.

KEOUGH	And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
BICKERMAN	Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.

BICKERMAN	I haven't broken any laws.
KEOUGH	Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
BICKERMAN	The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.

KEOUGH	Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
BICKERMAN	<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.

KEOUGH	Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
BICKERMAN	Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.

BICKERMAN	Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
KEOUGH	You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
BICKERMAN	Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.

BICKERMAN	I'll sue you.
KEOUGH	Go ahead.

HECTOR	You're a beautiful woman.
GARE	Thank you.
HECTOR	And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.

GARE	It seems like we're getting lower.
HECTOR	It happens when I land.
GARE	Why are we landing?
HECTOR	'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
GARE	<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.

GARE	C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
HECTOR	I need to see his habitat.

GARE	<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
HECTOR	He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.

GARE	I might get a shot.
HECTOR	<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
GARE	Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.

GARE	Go!!!
HECTOR	<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!

KEOUGH	--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
HECTOR	I'll need any and all topographic studies.
KEOUGH	Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
HECTOR	I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.

HECTOR	They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
KEOUGH	Mr. Cyr!
HECTOR	C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?

KEOUGH	I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
HECTOR	They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
KEOUGH	And what would he do come winter?
HECTOR	They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?

KEOUGH	Around here.  Yeah.
HECTOR	If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.

KEOUGH	We'd only just met.
HECTOR	Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
KEOUGH	Keystone what?
HECTOR	Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.

KEOUGH	We are here on official business.
HECTOR	Cocktail?
KEOUGH	<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
HECTOR	They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
KEOUGH	Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!

HECTOR	Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
KEOUGH	No!!  Out!

KEOUGH	You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
HECTOR	And you like me.
KEOUGH	I do <u>not</u> like you.
HECTOR	Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.

HECTOR	Jesus Christ!!
KEOUGH	What the hell are you doing?!!
HECTOR	What are <u>you</u> doing?!
KEOUGH	You're crawling around like a--
HECTOR	I'm laying a spring trap!
KEOUGH	A spring trap!
HECTOR	I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
KEOUGH	I coulda shot you, you--
HECTOR	This could end up saving your life,--

KEOUGH	Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
HECTOR	They don't really attack underwater and--
KEOUGH	That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
HECTOR	No crocodile has ever--

KEOUGH	Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
HECTOR	Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.

KEOUGH	Is this a trick?
HECTOR	What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.

KEOUGH	I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
HECTOR	No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.

HECTOR	Was he a good man?
KEOUGH	Yup.
HECTOR	Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.

KEOUGH	His head was just... bitten off.
HECTOR	I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.

HECTOR	This is a setback.
KEOUGH	You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.

HECTOR	Promise you won't kill me, first.
KEOUGH	I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?

KEOUGH	Asia?  How... how could he get here?
HECTOR	Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.

HECTOR	Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
KEOUGH	Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
HECTOR	<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.

HECTOR	What's that?
KEOUGH	It came from across the lake.

HECTOR	Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
KEOUGH	He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
HECTOR	Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
KEOUGH	I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
HECTOR	That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
KEOUGH	Raincheck.

KEOUGH	I can arrest you!!
HECTOR	Then do it!!
KEOUGH	You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
HECTOR	So profound and fat.

KEOUGH	Gee, that would really disappoint me.
HECTOR	Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.

HECTOR	No!
KEOUGH	I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
HECTOR	I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.

KEOUGH	Where is he?!
HECTOR	I don't know!

HECTOR	At school they'd always say "go" first.
JACK	Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
HECTOR	He never said "go".
JACK	Get the gun.

JACK	This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
HECTOR	Bastard bit my chopper.
JACK	Hey!!

HECTOR	Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
JACK	'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--

JACK	Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
HECTOR	I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
JACK	<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
HECTOR	Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--

JACK	No way.
HECTOR	Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.

JACK	So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
HECTOR	We both know what they'll do.

JACK	And again.  How would you get him on land?
HECTOR	That's actually the easy part.

JACK	Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
HECTOR	Right.
JACK	The more he thrashes, the better.
HECTOR	You ready on shore?
JACK	We're ready.

HECTOR	I got something on the screen.
JACK	You do?

JACK	Where?  Where?
HECTOR	Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
JACK	Can you confirm visually or just radar?
HECTOR	Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
JACK	Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.

JACK	Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
HECTOR	Thank you, Jack.
JACK	You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?

HECTOR	Where is he?
JACK	Tranq guns down, rifles up!

HECTOR	<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
JACK	Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--

JACK	You take care.
HECTOR	You talk to Bickerman?
JACK	She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
HECTOR	Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
JACK	Just those two.

KELLY	Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
HECTOR	That hurt my feelings.

HECTOR	If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
KELLY	I never had sex with you!
HECTOR	Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.

KELLY	But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
HECTOR	'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
KELLY	<u>Hector</u>.

KELLY	None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
HECTOR	What's going on?

HECTOR	Such the flirt.
KELLY	U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.

KELLY	You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
HECTOR	And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
KELLY	I'm just saying last resort.

HECTOR	Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
KELLY	What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
HECTOR	As if.  Will you miss me?

KELLY	He was an Indo-pacific.
HECTOR	Are you sure?
KELLY	Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.

KELLY	<u>Jack</u>!
HECTOR	I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--

KELLY	<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
HECTOR	You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
KELLY	Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
HECTOR	Nothing's real.
KELLY	Excuse me?
HECTOR	<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--

HECTOR	With crocodiles... everything's even.
KELLY	I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
HECTOR	I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
KELLY	Oh, bullshit.

HECTOR	Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
KELLY	No.
HECTOR	Eh.  Fuck it.
KELLY	Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
HECTOR	Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...

KELLY	What?
HECTOR	Could we have intercourse?

HECTOR	They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
KELLY	They could try to tranq him on land.
HECTOR	They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.

KELLY	And how would we neutralize him?
HECTOR	We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.

HECTOR	I'm okay.
KELLY	You're not okay, your leg's a mess.

KELLY	You're gonna be okay.
HECTOR	Guess I finally got bit.
KELLY	Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.

HECTOR	He's gonna live?
KELLY	Yeah.  Thanks to you.
HECTOR	And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.

KELLY	Kelly Scott.
JACK	Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
KELLY	Are we all museum bigots in Maine?

JACK	Did you make anything of the tooth?
KELLY	Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.

KELLY	Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
JACK	Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.

KELLY	How big do the bears get?
JACK	Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
KELLY	And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
JACK	Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.

KELLY	It really is beautiful, isn't it?
JACK	Never been to Maine before?
KELLY	I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.

JACK	Why are you here?  Really.
KELLY	I <u>told</u> you.
JACK	The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
KELLY	How would <u>you</u> know, what--
JACK	And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
KELLY	So I don't like tents, why--
JACK	You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--

KELLY	I'm not making it up.
JACK	Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
KELLY	I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.

KELLY	Oh my God.
JACK	What?
KELLY	If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
JACK	Who?
KELLY	Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.

JACK	In Maine?
KELLY	There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.

JACK	Same thing from Fish And Game.
KELLY	<u>Something's</u> in that water.
JACK	Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.

JACK	Baby crocs?
KELLY	Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
JACK	If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
KELLY	Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.

JACK	He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
KELLY	I'd be able to see something.

JACK	What are you doing?
KELLY	Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.

JACK	Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
KELLY	I beg your pardon?
JACK	Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
KELLY	I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
JACK	It's too dangerous for--
KELLY	I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
JACK	You flew up here because your boss--
KELLY	I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--

KELLY	That was an awful thing to say to me.
JACK	I'm sorry but you're...

JACK	Okay.  We're up at six.
KELLY	Good.
JACK	'Night.

JACK	He thinks they're what?
KELLY	In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.

KELLY	They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
JACK	Good.  See ya soon.
KELLY	Good luck.

JACK	You okay?  Kelly?
KELLY	Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
JACK	No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
KELLY	That's probably good.
JACK	Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.

JACK	<u>Are</u> you okay?
KELLY	Um... y'know...  Yeah.

KELLY	Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
JACK	I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.

JACK	You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
KELLY	Excuse me?
JACK	When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
KELLY	What are you talking about?
JACK	I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
KELLY	Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
JACK	Forgive me for trying to be nice.
KELLY	Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
JACK	I didn't say it like that.
KELLY	You <u>did</u>, you--
JACK	I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
KELLY	A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
JACK	Just forget it.

KELLY	Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
JACK	But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?

JACK	Like little children.  You okay?
KELLY	Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
JACK	I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
KELLY	I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
JACK	Let's get away from the shore.

JACK	Sorry.
KELLY	It's okay.

JACK	<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
KELLY	Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
JACK	Who taught you be be a nurse?
KELLY	Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
JACK	No thanks.
KELLY	Keep it dry.  No swimming.
JACK	Thank you.

JACK	You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
KELLY	What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?

JACK	That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
KELLY	Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.

JACK	Thanks for the... bandaid.
KELLY	Night.

JACK	Well.  Goodnight.
KELLY	We seem to say goodnight a lot.
JACK	We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...

KELLY	I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
JACK	Ssssh!
KELLY	What?
JACK	I heard something.

KELLY	Thing we can lift it?
JACK	Maybe.  Don't mush it.
KELLY	I'm not mushing it.
JACK	You're mushing it a little around the--
KELLY	<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.

JACK	Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
KELLY	<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
JACK	Really--
KELLY	<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
JACK	Calm down.
KELLY	You calm down!
JACK	<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.

KELLY	What?
JACK	Look.

JACK	You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
KELLY	Alright, Jack!
JACK	<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--

JACK	Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
KELLY	Okay.
JACK	We might as well pack.
KELLY	Good idea.

JACK	Are we crazy?
KELLY	Well...
JACK	We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.

JACK	It can't work.
KELLY	He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
JACK	He looks like a giant tea bag.

JACK	He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
KELLY	He's floating.  Take it home.
JACK	Hector.

KELLY	He's mooing.
JACK	You wouldn't?

KELLY	Watch out!!
JACK	Keep firing!

KELLY	Hector!!
JACK	Take him.

KELLY	We gotta get to Hector!!
JACK	Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!

KELLY	He's through fighting.  Look at him.
JACK	I don't care.  Hank.  End it.

JACK	Get him onto shore.
KELLY	He heeds a tourniquet.

KELLY	Well...
JACK	You wanna ride in my truck?

JACK	You sure?  I don't mind...
KELLY	No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.

JACK	If I'm ever in New York...
KELLY	Yeah.

JACK	Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
KELLY	But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.

JACK	It was... something meeting you.
KELLY	Likewise.

KELLY	Different worlds, Jack.
JACK	Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
KELLY	No.
JACK	So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
KELLY	You think?
JACK	Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
KELLY	Probably not.

JACK	That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
KELLY	Good thinking.

JACK	We set?
KEOUGH	Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.

KEOUGH	I'm ready when you are.
JACK	Let's go.

KEOUGH	Half mile up, there's a clearing.
JACK	You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
KEOUGH	I'll call the coroner.

JACK	What's that?
KEOUGH	White perch.
JACK	Are they feeding?
KEOUGH	Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
JACK	They look like they're jumping.

JACK	Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
KEOUGH	Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?

JACK	You said nobody came in here!
KEOUGH	Obviously I was wrong!

JACK	Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
KEOUGH	We shouldn't even really be doing this.
JACK	They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
KEOUGH	So does he.

KEOUGH	Now I'm gonna puke.
JACK	<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.

JACK	Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
KEOUGH	Other than to eat us?

KEOUGH	I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
JACK	Where is he?!

JACK	If you get a safe shot...
KEOUGH	I'll take it!
JACK	Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.

KEOUGH	He's done.  He's dying.
JACK	Don't count on it.  We better take him out.

KEOUGH	Thanks for your help.
JACK	You too.

KEOUGH	He just came up screaming.
KELLY	Did he say anything?
KEOUGH	He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
KELLY	And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
KEOUGH	The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
KELLY	<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
KEOUGH	Yes.
KELLY	Is the dead guy in there?
KEOUGH	That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
KELLY	Um.  No, no.  Let's go.

KEOUGH	I wouldn't.
KELLY	I'm fine, thank you.
KEOUGH	Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
KELLY	Well.  At wakes.
KEOUGH	This is a little different.
KELLY	I can look at dead things.

KELLY	This... how long did this attack go on for?
KEOUGH	Seconds.  Three, four.
KELLY	And this is how he came to the boat?
KEOUGH	Yes.
KELLY	Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?

KEOUGH	Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
KELLY	You talk to the married couple?
KEOUGH	Not yet.
KELLY	What kind of backup do we have?
KEOUGH	<u>We</u>?

KELLY	What?
KEOUGH	Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
KELLY	You have a thing against museums?
KEOUGH	I got nothing against--
KELLY	Ever even been <u>in</u> one?

KELLY	<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
KEOUGH	Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
KELLY	And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?

KEOUGH	You're sort of a rude person.
KELLY	It's just that--

KELLY	We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
KEOUGH	Was he swallowed?
KELLY	Sheriff.

KELLY	What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
KEOUGH	They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
KELLY	Gee.

KEOUGH	The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
KELLY	We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
KEOUGH	I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
KELLY	Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
KEOUGH	What the hell?

KELLY	What?
KEOUGH	I thought I saw...
KELLY	It looks like a branch.

KEOUGH	Hey!!
KELLY	You threw it at me!!
KEOUGH	I just let go of it.

KEOUGH	With what?
KELLY	Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.

KEOUGH	They don't believe her.
KELLY	Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 

KELLY	You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
KEOUGH	<u>Apologize</u>?

KEOUGH	Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
KELLY	It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
KEOUGH	Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
KELLY	I'm sorry.

KEOUGH	Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
KELLY	I asked you to be nice to him.

KELLY	He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
KEOUGH	And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
KELLY	He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
KEOUGH	You like Jack?
KELLY	<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
KEOUGH	Hector thinks you like him.
KELLY	Well Hector's a giant cracker.
KEOUGH	You think Jack's handsome?
KELLY	What is this?
KEOUGH	I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
KELLY	Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.

KEOUGH	Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
KELLY	<u>That</u> was a bust.

KELLY	What was that?
KEOUGH	I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.

KEOUGH	Are you alright?
KELLY	I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?

KELLY	Hank?
KEOUGH	Yes.

KELLY	Are you okay?
KEOUGH	Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?

KELLY	Hank!
KEOUGH	He said he knew Karate!

KELLY	Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
KEOUGH	Look.

KELLY	What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
KEOUGH	What?
KELLY	Look ten feet into the water.

KELLY	If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
KEOUGH	She's worried about the cow now.

KEOUGH	They're coming right in.
KELLY	Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
KEOUGH	That it's about to go wrong.

KELLY	Did you get him?
KEOUGH	I don't know.  Back the truck--

KEOUGH	Should I?
KELLY	Wait.

KELLY	I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
KEOUGH	I guess.

KEVIN	Kelly.
KELLY	Kevin, hey.

KEVIN	Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
KELLY	Absolutely.

KEVIN	I had a great time last night. Again.
KELLY	Me too.

KELLY	That's not what you came to say.
KEVIN	You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...

KELLY	I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
KEVIN	I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
KELLY	Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
KEVIN	The somebody else part?
KELLY	Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
KEVIN	Else.

KELLY	Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
KEVIN	A jerk.
KELLY	<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
KEVIN	It's ten after nine.
KELLY	Yes, well...  famished.

KEVIN	Hey.
KELLY	Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
KEVIN	This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
KELLY	A tooth?
KEVIN	A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
KELLY	Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
KEVIN	I want you to go there.

KELLY	Sorry?
KEVIN	I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
KELLY	This is what we do?
KEVIN	I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
KELLY	Are you on drugs?
KEVIN	Kelly--
KELLY	I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
KEVIN	Part of our research--
KELLY	I'm not even a field person.
KEVIN	Well on this one I'd like you to be.

KELLY	This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
KEVIN	It has nothing to do with--
KELLY	I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
KEVIN	<u>Kelly</u>--
KELLY	<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.

KELLY	What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
OKUBO	I <u>tapped</u> you.
KELLY	Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
OKUBO	Wild guess.
KELLY	I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
OKUBO	Kevin told me you were upset.
KELLY	Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
OKUBO	Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.

KELLY	<u>You</u>?
OKUBO	It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
KELLY	<u>You</u>?
OKUBO	It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
KELLY	You and Kevin.
OKUBO	It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...

KELLY	You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
OKUBO	Kelly--
KELLY	I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
OKUBO	Backstabber?
KELLY	No.
OKUBO	Liar?
KELLY	Myra.
OKUBO	Shitbutt?
KELLY	I really... I should get back.

ALFRED	You had to remind me?
VADA	Are you writing a poem?
ALFRED	No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?

VADA	Umm, where do you want this?
ALFRED	Oh, just put it over there.

VADA	Do you still teach?
ALFRED	No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.

VADA	My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
ALFRED	UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
VADA	Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
ALFRED	Ohhhhh.

VADA	People said she looked like me.
ALFRED	I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
VADA	I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
ALFRED	Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
VADA	No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
ALFRED	Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.

BOY	Excuse me I asked you a question.
VADA	I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
BOY	You're Vada right?

VADA	How did you know my name?
BOY	Your Uncle Phil told me.
VADA	Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
BOY	Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
VADA	This is California, anything is possible.
BOY	Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
VADA	Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
BOY	My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
VADA	Gee, that is a problem.

VADA	Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
BOY	What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
VADA	I don't think you're very polite.
BOY	Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.

VADA	THANK YOU.
BOY	Don't mention it.
VADA	I don't even know your name.

NICK	What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
DARYL	I would do it again in a minute.

DARYL	Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
NICK	What about giving the other guy a break.
DARYL	What about living in the real world pal?

NICK	Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
DARYL	I thought I told you to lose this guy.
NICK	Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
DARYL	I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
NICK	I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
DARYL	You're still asking me to break the law.

NICK	So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
DARYL	Me, I'll know!

DARYL	It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
VADA	What do you remember about her.
DARYL	Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.

VADA	Wow, you walked out with my mother?
DARYL	You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick

DARYL	She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
VADA	Suspended from school, my mother??
DARYL	Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.

DARYL	I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
VADA	His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?

DARYL	Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
VADA	Pommeroy.
DARYL	Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
VADA	I'm leaving Sunday.
DARYL	Could you hold on for a second? 

VADA	Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
DARYL	Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.

HARRY	Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
VADA	Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.

HARRY	I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
VADA	I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.

VADA	Do what?
HARRY	Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
VADA	You want me to move?
HARRY	Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.

VADA	Okay, no problem.
HARRY	Okay thanks, atta girl.

VADA	Visualize a spare?
HARRY	Well you know what I mean.
VADA	So, what's on your mind?
HARRY	Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
VADA	You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
HARRY	No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.

VADA	Shelly's already told me all about sex.
HARRY	She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
VADA	I figured you did.

HARRY	Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
VADA	No it's okay, I understand, really.
HARRY	Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.

VADA	Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
HARRY	Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
VADA	Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
HARRY	Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
VADA	Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
HARRY	Seriously?
VADA	Seriously.
HARRY	Great.

VADA	Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
HARRY	What boy likes you?
VADA	It's just a question, it's not about anybody.

VADA	So you're saying...What are you saying??
HARRY	Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.

VADA	The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
HARRY	Her favorite poet.

VADA	There's still a big spot on the floor.
HARRY	Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
VADA	Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
HARRY	Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.

HARRY	She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
VADA	Was it a nice funeral?
HARRY	Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?

VADA	You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
HARRY	Of course.
VADA	I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
HARRY	Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
VADA	I already bought a ticket.
HARRY	What??
VADA	I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.

VADA	No nuns, got it.
HARRY	And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.

VADA	What does that mean?
HARRY	It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?

VADA	Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
HARRY	Thanks, I needed that.
VADA	I'll be back in 137 hours.
HARRY	Have fun.

HARRY	Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
VADA	Hi Dad.
HARRY	Hi honey.
VADA	I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
HARRY	Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
VADA	Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.

VADA	Yeah.
HARRY	Totally groovy huh?
VADA	Totally.
HARRY	Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
VADA	I will. How's Shelly?
HARRY	Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
VADA	Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
HARRY	I love you too sweetie, bye.
VADA	Give my love to Shelly.

VADA	What happened to Shelly?
HARRY	She just had a baby that's all.
VADA	We have a baby?
HARRY	Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
VADA	Can I see him?
HARRY	You can do anything you want. You're his sister.

HARRY	Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
SHELLY	If I eat it I'll throw up.
HARRY	Well you should at least try a little bit.
SHELLY	Then I'll throw up a little bit.

SHELLY	I don't know if I want to.
HARRY	Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.

HARRY	Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
SHELLY	Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.

HARRY	Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
SHELLY	Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.

HARRY	Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
SHELLY	Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?

SHELLY	Never heard of him. 
HARRY	How about a nice glass of milk?
SHELLY	And some taco chips so I can dunk.

HARRY	I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
SHELLY	No.
HARRY	Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.

HARRY	She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
SHELLY	She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
HARRY	Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
SHELLY	You're being narrow-minded.

HARRY	Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
SHELLY	Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
HARRY	I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.

HARRY	Reason? What reason?
SHELLY	Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...

HARRY	I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
SHELLY	I was pushing as fast as I could.

SHELLY	Maybe he's wet?
HARRY	Maybe he's hungry.

VADA	Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
HILLARY	Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?

VADA	It's okay really, I was just a baby.
HILLARY	I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.

VADA	Thanks.
HILLARY	I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.

VADA	His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
HILLARY	Oh.  Ohhh?
VADA	What're you saying?
HILLARY	Ummmmm, look, I...I...
VADA	Are you saying my mother had another husband?
HILLARY	Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
VADA	They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.

JEFFREY	Sure am, who are you?
VADA	I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
JEFFREY	Maggie...Maggie's little girl.

JEFFREY	I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
VADA	You mean, you knew about me?

JEFFREY	Umm...can you come in for a minute?
VADA	I'd like to, thanks.

VADA	Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
JEFFREY	Does she?

JEFFREY	I'm glad you're here.
VADA	You are?
JEFFREY	Yeah, come on, let's talk.

VADA	We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
JEFFREY	Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
VADA	Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
VADA	I told you it was a long story.
JEFFREY	That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
VADA	Special effects?
JEFFREY	Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
VADA	I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
JEFFREY	I'll try.

VADA	And she saved it.
JEFFREY	Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
VADA	Do you have any pictures if her?
JEFFREY	I've got something better.

VADA	She's beautiful.
JEFFREY	We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.

JEFFREY	Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
VADA	More than anything in the world.
JEFFREY	It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
VADA	Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
JEFFREY	Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
VADA	I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
JEFFREY	I'd say you turned out just fine.
VADA	I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
JEFFREY	Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
VADA	Well...
JEFFREY	Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.

JEFFREY	Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
VADA	oh.
JEFFREY	She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.

JUDY	Hi.
VADA	Come on in!
JUDY	That's okay.
VADA	It's just a corpse.
JUDY	I know that.
VADA	You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??

JUDY	My mother can't have any more kids.
VADA	Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.

VADA	What are you staring at?
JUDY	It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
VADA	See you? He can smell you from there.
JUDY	Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.

VADA	What's the matter?
JUDY	He likes you.
VADA	Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
JUDY	Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
VADA	That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
JUDY	I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!

JUDY	Hi.
VADA	Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
JUDY	ehh...I don't know I mean....

JUDY	Then what did she do?
VADA	Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.

JUDY	So she had you in jail, in Russia?
VADA	Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.

KEVIN	Is it okay if I drink this?
VADA	It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
KEVIN	Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.

KEVIN	Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
VADA	But I wanna write about her.
KEVIN	You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
VADA	No-one invented gravity, it just exists.

KEVIN	Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
VADA	No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
KEVIN	All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
VADA	That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.

ROSE	Hello.
MAN	Hi.
ROSE	What can I do for you?
MAN	Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
ROSE	Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
MAN	Then I have come to the right place.
ROSE	I guess you have.
MAN	I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
ROSE	Rose.

VADA	This is really very nice of you.
MAN	It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.

MAN	If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
VADA	O.K. Thank you very much.
MAN	Happy hunting.

VADA	He's writing. Hello?
MAN	If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
VADA	You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?

MAN	Hi there...can I help you?
VADA	Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?

MR. OWETT	Vada?
VADA	The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.

MR. OWETT	Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
VADA	My mother.
MR. OWETT	Your mother?
VADA	I never met my mother.

MR. OWETT	Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
VADA	Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
MR. OWETT	You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
VADA	Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
MR. OWETT	I'm sure she did. 

NICK	Thanks
ROSE	Give it back Nicholas!
NICK	But we made a business deal.
ROSE	What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?

ROSE	Nicholas! What are you doing up?
NICK	I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
ROSE	There's water in your bathroom.
NICK	I want juice!
ROSE	Don't wake up Vada.
NICK	I won't.

NICK	If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
ROSE	You're so clever.

ROSE	You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
NICK	You're over reacting!
ROSE	Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
NICK	MOM!
ROSE	You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.

VADA	Thanks....
NICK	No THANKS!
VADA	He said it was a gift.
NICK	Yeah, RIGHT.
VADA	I don't need you to be telling me to...
NICK	TAXI!!!

VADA	My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
NICK	And you're gonna solve the mystery?
VADA	I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.

NICK	You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
VADA	I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
NICK	I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
VADA	Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.

NICK	Getting off please.
VADA	Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.

NICK	They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
VADA	It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
NICK	Vada.
VADA	WHAT??
NICK	Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.

NICK	I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
VADA	Just remember the needle in the haystack.
NICK	I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
VADA	What difference does it make?
NICK	A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
VADA	Oh my gosh, here it is!

VADA	Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
NICK	Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
VADA	It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
NICK	I love the fragrance of chilidogs.

NICK	Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
VADA	I'd never do that.
NICK	Get married?
VADA	Change my name.
NICK	What, you think the guy should change his name?

VADA	I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
NICK	What if you don't wanna be found?
VADA	Why do you argue with everything I say?

NICK	You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
VADA	Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.

VADA	You ratted on my mother??
NICK	Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?

NICK	Care for a smoke?
VADA	This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
NICK	I think it's cool.
VADA	You would.
NICK	You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.

NICK	Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
VADA	May I use the phone please.

NICK	Boy, you're really into this.
VADA	He is one of the great poets.

NICK	If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
VADA	At least it gives you plenty of exercise.

NICK	Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
VADA	And I thought I was weird.
NICK	You are weird. Let's just go.
VADA	Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.

NICK	Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
VADA	This isn't just a mood ring.
NICK	Does it work?
VADA	Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
NICK	Boyfriend?
VADA	Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.

NICK	Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
VADA	Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
NICK	Let me see if it changes colors on me.
VADA	ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.

NICK	Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
VADA	Don't force it, you'll break it.
NICK	I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
VADA	I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.

NICK	Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
VADA	Give it to me!
NICK	Come and get it.
VADA	Just give it to me!!
NICK	Just come and get it...right here!
VADA	DON'T, come on!!!

NICK	Woah, watch it!
VADA	DON'T!!!
NICK	Uh oh...
VADA	What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
NICK	...I dropped it.
VADA	In the tar??
NICK	It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.

NICK	Where are you going???
VADA	Owh...

NICK	What are you doing? You can't go in there!
VADA	Oh no?!?!?!

NICK	It's dangerous!!
VADA	Leave me alone!!

NICK	You mean,  this ring?
VADA	Jerk! You IDIOT!!!

NICK	Never heard of her.
VADA	Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
NICK	Here's Judy Garland!

VADA	My mother stood on this very spot.
NICK	I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
VADA	That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
NICK	Big deal.

VADA	What's he smoking?
NICK	What do you think?
VADA	Really?

VADA	Hey look!
NICK	This is a totally barbaric custom.

VADA	Right.
NICK	And you'd be my cousin?
VADA	Yeah I guess...sort of.
NICK	But we wouldn't really be related right?
VADA	Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
NICK	Good. I mean...
VADA	Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
NICK	I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.

VADA	It's not his fault!
NICK	No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.

VADA	No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
NICK	He's an undertaker.

VADA	Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
NICK	Like what?
VADA	Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,

NICK	That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
VADA	Nick?
NICK	Yeah?
VADA	This has been a real confusing day.

VADA	And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
NICK	You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.

VADA	...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
NICK	Some sacrifices are worth it.
VADA	You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
NICK	I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
VADA	An adventure?
NICK	Part adventure...part miracle.

NICK	Write me a poem?
NICK	No?
VADA	I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
NICK	Good-bye, look in your backpack.

NICK	Muh??
PHIL	I'd consider it a personal favor.

NICK	What's that?
PHIL	Ten bucks.
NICK	What's it for?
PHIL	For the mini-bike fund.
NICK	Wow!
PHIL	Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
NICK	No problem.
PHIL	You're a good man Nicholas.
NICK	Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off

SAM	Well Rose was being very thorough.
PHIL	Was Rose.

PHIL	Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
SAM	Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.

PHIL	Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
SAM	I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
PHIL	Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
SAM	Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?

SAM	And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
PHIL	You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
SAM	I don't think the color of the interior is....
PHIL	Rose this not the place to be having this...

PHIL	Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
VADA	They're great.
PHIL	How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
VADA	He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
PHIL	Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note

VADA	She lives here too?
PHIL	Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
VADA	But...are you engaged or something?
PHIL	Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.

VADA	Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
PHIL	That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
VADA	Committed?
PHIL	Committed.
VADA	So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
PHIL	Yes, it does.

VADA	Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
PHIL	Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.

VADA	I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
PHIL	I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.

PHIL	Lock the door.
VADA	Bye.

PHIL	Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
VADA	Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.

VADA	I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
PHIL	How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
VADA	I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
PHIL	Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.

VADA	Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
PHIL	I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.

VADA	Maybe.
PHIL	Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
VADA	A secret, I like that.
PHIL	This is it I guess.
VADA	Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
PHIL	You want me to come with?
VADA	I should do this myself.
PHIL	Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
VADA	Okay.

PHIL	No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
VADA	Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
PHIL	Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.

PHIL	Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
ROSE	Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
PHIL	Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.

PHIL	Then you'll be all set.
ROSE	Sounds like you're very organized.

ROSE	No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
PHIL	Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.

PHIL	What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
ROSE	He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
PHIL	He was caressing.
ROSE	Phil for God sake.
PHIL	God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
PHIL	Oh...what's that?
ROSE	Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.

PHIL	Hi!
ROSE	Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?

ROSE	Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
PHIL	Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.

PHIL	We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
ROSE	There's plenty of fruit.
PHIL	You know where the fire extinguisher is.

PHIL	Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
ROSE	I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
PHIL	Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
ROSE	No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.

ROSE	Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
PHIL	You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
ROSE	I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.

ROSE	I think this place is just fine.
PHIL	You know how I feel about you.
ROSE	You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...

ROSE	You really think I look sexy in this smock?
PHIL	Is that a yes?

VADA	You're Nick's mother?
ROSE	What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.

VADA	I'm just tired.
ROSE	All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.

ROSE	Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
VADA	Not exactly.
ROSE	Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.

VADA	Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
ROSE	She'll be all right baby.
VADA	Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.

VADA	Bye Aunt Rose.
ROSE	Bye Niece, Vada.

ROSE	So what's wrong?
SAM	Nothing, nothing at all.
ROSE	I mean...with your car.
SAM	Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
ROSE	Excuse me?
SAM	I was commenting on your hair.
ROSE	Oh, are you a hairdresser?
SAM	I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
ROSE	Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
SAM	Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.

SAM	...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
ROSE	Yes, I do.
SAM	...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...

ROSE	Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
SAM	I'll be here.

SAM	Good morning.
ROSE	Well maybe for you.
SAM	Something wrong?
ROSE	Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
SAM	Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.

ROSE	Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
SAM	You couldn't?
ROSE	Well I'm sort of involved.
SAM	Sort of?
ROSE	Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
SAM	Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
ROSE	Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
SAM	All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
ROSE	Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
SAM	Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.

SAM	Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
ROSE	Oh, sure okay.
SAM	I'll see you then...I look forward to it.

VADA	Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
SHELLY	I bet your mom sang to you.

SHELLY	They're enormous, I know.
VADA	Is there milk in them already?
SHELLY	No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
VADA	When did you umm, I mean umm...
SHELLY	Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
VADA	Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
SHELLY	I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
VADA	You're telling me.

VADA	Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
SHELLY	Oh no.

SHELLY	Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
VADA	Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.

SHELLY	What's this? December 8th, 1958?
VADA	I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
SHELLY	Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
VADA	This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
SHELLY	Oh Vada she's so beautiful.

VADA	Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
SHELLY	No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
VADA	Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
SHELLY	Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
VADA	I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
SHELLY	Well you've gotta be prepared.
VADA	I'm definitely traveling some day.

SHELLY	Why not now?
VADA	What do you mean?
SHELLY	How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
VADA	But what about you and the baby? You need me.
SHELLY	Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
VADA	Yeah, it would be kinda great.
SHELLY	It would be fantastic.
VADA	But Dad'll never go for it.
SHELLY	You leave your father to me.

VADA	Shelly?
SHELLY	Hey! Oh look.
VADA	He's so tiny.
SHELLY	I know, look at his little hands.

VADA	Did it hurt a lot?
SHELLY	You have no idea.

VADA	Let me hold him.
SHELLY	O.K.

VADA	Really?
STANLEY	Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.

VADA	Beidermeyer?
STANLEY	Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
VADA	He's a great poet.
STANLEY	He is?
VADA	Do you know him?
STANLEY	Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
VADA	He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?

STANLEY	No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
VADA	Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
STANLEY	I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
VADA	This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...

ALDYS	Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
JOSIE	I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
ALDYS	When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
JOSIE	Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.

JOSIE	Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
ALDYS	guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-

JOSIE	What?
ALDYS	Well, do you?
JOSIE	Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
ALDYS	Nice.

JOSIE	How long will they watch us for?
ALDYS	Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
JOSIE	Why do they listen to Guy?

ALDYS	: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
JOSIE	Yeah. Let's do that.

ALDYS	Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
JOSIE	Oh I know.

ALDYS	I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
JOSIE	Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.

JOSIE	So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
ALDYS	Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.

ALDYS	Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
JOSIE	Thanks.
ALDYS	Sure. No problem.

ALDYS	Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
JOSIE	Petty good.
ALDYS	How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
JOSIE	College?
ALDYS	NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.

JOSIE	What is with this school and prom?
ALDYS	Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
JOSIE	Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
ALDYS	This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--

JOSIE	What's that?
ALDYS	That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.

ALDYS	Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
JOSIE	Yeah, I know.
ALDYS	I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?

JOSIE	Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
ALDYS	Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
JOSIE	It is?
ALDYS	Yes, it's lame.
JOSIE	Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
ALDYS	Exactly.

ALDYS	Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
JOSIE	 uhh, must have forgotten-
ALDYS	No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.

ALDYS	Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
JOSIE	Right. 7:30.
ALDYS	I'm late for lab.

JOSIE	What?
ALDYS	Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
JOSIE	Oh. I forgot.

ALDYS	It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
JOSIE	Well I'm so glad that you guys are.

ANITA	Oh, man! Who told?
GUS	Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.

GUS	YOU DID.
ANITA	YOU KNIT?

ANITA	Gus, have you ever been in love?
GUS	Leave.
ANITA	Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
GUS	Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
ANITA	You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.

GUS	Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
ANITA	Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
GUS	No Roger from op/ed?
ANITA	Nope.

SAM	Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
ANITA	Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
SAM	You're Pam?
ANITA	If you say so.

ANITA	I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
SAM	I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
ANITA	Right. Right.

SAM	Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
ANITA	OH! How about "Under the Sea?"

ANITA	Well excuse me.
SAM	What about the "Roaring Twenties"
 or "The 80's"?

ANITA	Guess who I did it with last night...
JOSIE	Roger in Op/Ed.
ANITA	Who told!
JOSIE	You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
ANITA	Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.

JOSIE	Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
ANITA	And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?

ANITA	Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
JOSIE	Yeah.
ANITA	You stood for like a month.

JOSIE	Forget it.
ANITA	I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
JOSIE	I'm concentrating on my career right now.
ANITA	Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
JOSIE	Anita!
ANITA	Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.

JOSIE	The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
ANITA	Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
JOSIE	When I finally get kissed, I'll know.

ANITA	Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
JOSIE	I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--

JOSIE	My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
ANITA	Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.

JOSIE	You don't think I can do it.
ANITA	No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!

JOSIE	Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
ANITA	Jos, that's not what we're --
JOSIE	Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?

ANITA	Senorita Josie.
JOSIE	And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?

ANITA	So, you were a geek. Big deal.
JOSIE	Anita, remember espadrilles?
ANITA	Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
JOSIE	The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
ANITA	Okay. That's bad.
JOSIE	At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
ANITA	Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.

ANITA	Now this is cute.
JOSIE	That is lingerie.
ANITA	So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
JOSIE	What'd you feel when you kissed him?
ANITA	Bridgework?
JOSIE	Very romantic.

JOSIE	How about this?
ANITA	I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.

ANITA	Cuuuute!
JOSIE	'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
ANITA	And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
JOSIE	Anita!
ANITA	Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!

ANITA	Hi!

ANITA	Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
JOSIE	Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
ANITA	You need my help?
JOSIE	No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.

JOSIE	Wow. It's packed.
ANITA	It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.

JOSIE	George! What are you doing here?
GEORGE	Just get in the van, Josie.

JOSIE	What is this?
GEORGE	Hidden camera.
JOSIE	Wings?
GEORGE	We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
JOSIE	I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.

GIBBY	Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
KRISTEN	Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.

KRISTEN	wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
GIBBY	Sometimes opposites attract.

GIBBY	Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
KRISTEN	Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.

GIBBY	Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
KRISTEN	Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.

GIBBY	You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
KRISTEN	That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?

JOSIE	That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
GIBBY	Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.

GIBBY	I think it's pronounced gauche.
JOSIE	Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.

GIBBY	Josie, you have totally transitioned.
JOSIE	Transitioned?
GIBBY	You crossed over.

GIBBY	: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
JOSIE	Why?

GIBBY	He is totally crunching on you.
JOSIE	Do I want to be crunched?
GIBBY	By Guy?

GIBBY	Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
JOSIE	Betty.

GIBBY	Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
JOSIE	Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?

GUS	Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
JOSIE	It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.

JOSIE	Well, excuse me for caring about words.
GUS	So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.

GUS	How many times have I fired her?
JOSIE	Five-- Six--
GUS	Eh.

JOSIE	Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
GUS	Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
JOSIE	Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
GUS	Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
JOSIE	You've done five of my ideas.
GUS	You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
JOSIE	They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
GUS	A flack jacket.
JOSIE	A--flack jacket.
GUS	Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
JOSIE	You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
GUS	Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
JOSIE	Hey--I can be out of control.

GUS	Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
JOSIE	But I don't want it straightened out.
GUS	Geller, this is way out of your league.

JOSIE	It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
GUS	You're a sick puppy, Geller.

JOSIE	It's an expose on cafeteria food.
GUS	And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
JOSIE	Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
GUS	Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!

GUS	No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
JOSIE	Oh. Right.

GUS	Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
JOSIE	Kristen got a quote?

JOSIE	Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
GUS	Have you been there?
JOSIE	Uhh, no.
GUS	Have you been to any parties?
JOSIE	Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--

GUS	This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
JOSIE	Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.

GUS	Do you even know these kids?
JOSIE	They hid my car--

GUS	Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
JOSIE	Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
GUS	OUT!

JOSIE	Gus?
GUS	No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
JOSIE	What if I say no?
GUS	I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.

GUS	That's your story!
JOSIE	You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
GUS	It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
JOSIE	He's my teacher!
GUS	And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
JOSIE	There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
GUS	Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
JOSIE	You already pitched this to Rigfort?!

GUS	Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
JOSIE	Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
GUS	I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.

JOSIE	Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
GUY	Are you in special ed?

JOSIE	Oh my god.
GUY	Dude, you rock!

JOSIE	Rob's?
GUY	Yeah, you gonna be there?

GUY	Hey there.
JOSIE	Hey. There.

JOSIE	Maybe we should go in a different room?
GUY	I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.

GUY	I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
JOSIE	Yes. I'll go. Yes.

GUY	Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
JOSIE	You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
GUY	Cool. I'll catch you later.

GUY	You having fun?
JOSIE	Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.

GUY	Hey--what are you thinking about?
JOSIE	Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
GUY	My sword.

JOSIE	Oh.
GUY	Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
JOSIE	You said that already.

TRACY	God, I can't do this.
JOSIE	Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
TRACY	You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
JOSIE	Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.

JOSIE	You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
TRACY	But I'm not a penguin.

JOSIE	Hey Rob, what's going on?
TRACY	I'm Rob's prom date.

JOSIE	That is so--weird that you name your car.
ROB	No it's not. Guys name their penises.
JOSIE	Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
ROB	She just needs a new windshield wiper.
JOSIE	Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.

JOSIE	Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
ROB	No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
JOSIE	Better person than I.
ROB	See!
JOSIE	I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
ROB	I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
JOSIE	This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
ROB	Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
JOSIE	How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
ROB	Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
JOSIE	For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!

JOSIE	It's just for a couple of months.
ROB	You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
JOSIE	I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.

ROB	Wow. This must be big.
JOSIE	I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.

JOSIE	What!?
ROB	Do you remember high school?
JOSIE	It was a long time ago -
ROB	Don't you remember what they called you?

JOSIE	Josie Grossie.
ROB	I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
JOSIE	Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.

JOSIE	Are mom and dad here?
ROB	No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
JOSIE	Good.

ROB	No, I mean, no big whoop.
JOSIE	I can't do this.

ROB	These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
JOSIE	Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
ROB	Why is that impossible?

JOSIE	Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
ROB	Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
JOSIE	Rob. Please focus.

ROB	Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
JOSIE	Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
ROB	Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
JOSIE	Is that true?
ROB	Little known fact.

ROB	Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
JOSIE	Yes, desperately.
ROB	Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
JOSIE	Better than I...
ROB	That's the spirit!

JOSIE	I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
ROB	No. Josie, this is real.

JOSIE	Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
ROB	This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
JOSIE	You're twenty-three years old!
ROB	With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
JOSIE	Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.

JOSIE	Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
ROB	And a gymnast!
JOSIE	She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.

ROB	Wow, Josie- you look really-
JOSIE	Rufus?
ROB	Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
JOSIE	Thanks. And what are -
ROB	Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".

JOSIE	Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
ROB	I know.

ROB	Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
JOSIE	Really?

ROB	No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
JOSIE	wasn't even thinking about-
ROB	No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
JOSIE	I-
ROB	No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.

SAM	Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
JOSIE	I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.

SAM	Whoa. Deja Vu.
JOSIE	Sorry. Forgetful.

JOSIE	Dorothy Parker--
SAM	You like her?
JOSIE	I love the way she writes.
SAM	Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
JOSIE	But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
SAM	True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
JOSIE	Sure, why?
SAM	Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
JOSIE	Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--

SAM	Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
JOSIE	Oh I don't think so.
SAM	Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
JOSIE	Thank you.
SAM	So what are you thinking for college?
JOSIE	College. Haven't really thought about it.
SAM	That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
JOSIE	Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
SAM	Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
JOSIE	Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
SAM	Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"

SAM	This seat taken?
JOSIE	Thank you.

JOSIE	Are you--scared?
SAM	I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
JOSIE	You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
SAM	Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
JOSIE	Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
SAM	You remember that story?
JOSIE	Of course. I remember everything from your class.

SAM	Yoooooow.
JOSIE	Don't look down!

SAM	Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
JOSIE	That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
SAM	God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
JOSIE	You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
SAM	You have to say that. You're my student.
JOSIE	I don't have to say that.

SAM	Boys.
JOSIE	I know.
SAM	I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
JOSIE	Why do you do that?
SAM	I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
JOSIE	That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--

JOSIE	You have to say that. You're my teacher.
SAM	I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.

SAM	Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
JOSIE	When are you going to open your eyes?
SAM	I'm thinking when I'm home.

SAM	You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
JOSIE	Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
SAM	Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
JOSIE	But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
SAM	That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
JOSIE	That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
SAM	Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
JOSIE	To put us back together again when we fall.

SAM	Our penguin, right?
JOSIE	Do you think you'll find her?
SAM	Yeah, actually I do.

SAM	Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
JOSIE	What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
SAM	No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
JOSIE	Oh--yikes!
SAM	told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
JOSIE	Wow. You believe in me that much--
SAM	Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.

SAM	Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
JOSIE	Thanks. So do you.

SAM	Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
JOSIE	Well, are you here with anybody?
SAM	No, I'm alone.
JOSIE	It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?

SAM	So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
JOSIE	Yeah, I have.

SAM	Surprise! you were doing a story on me?!
JOSIE	No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
SAM	What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
JOSIE	You were attracted to me?
SAM	Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
JOSIE	Wait, I was going to tell you--
SAM	You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
JOSIE	But now you don't have to--
SAM	Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
JOSIE	I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
SAM	The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
JOSIE	I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.

JOSIE	Please. Please don't walk away.
SAM	I just can't look at you the same way.

SAM	I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
JOSIE	I finally found my story.

SHEILA	Yes.
JOSIE	What?
SHEILA	Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
JOSIE	Why?
SHEILA	I don't know.
JOSIE	The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
SHEILA	That's what I'm saying.

KIRSTEN	That is so sad --
KRISTEN	I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.

KRISTEN	Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
KIRSTEN	Nah uh.

KRISTEN	Into our group.
KIRSTEN	It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.

KIRSTEN	We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
KRISTEN	We're very evolved.

KRISTEN	Josie, you look Rufus.
KIRSTEN	Who are you guys?

KRISTEN	You ruined the whole thing!
KIRSTEN	You so do not deserve to be prom queen.

ROB	Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
MONTY	I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
ROB	I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
MONTY	Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
ROB	I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.

MONTY	Aloha! Welcome!
ROB	Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.

TRACY	Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
ROB	Thank you.  I'm Rob.
TRACY	Duh.

TRACY	Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
ROB	Well, a ball player.
TRACY	No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post"?! Totally lame.

TRACY	Are you having fun?
ROB	Yeah. Definitely.

TRACY	Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
ROB	Maybe we should sit.

ROB	Wow - I-
TRACY	Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.

MAGGIE	What is he up to now?
BOB	Ike just came by to check out the team.

MAGGIE	Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
BOB	I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.

MAGGIE	At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
BOB	Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
MAGGIE	You don't understand this guy.
BOB	Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
MAGGIE	I'm not running.
BOB	So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
MAGGIE	I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.

MAGGIE	Right.
BOB	I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.

MAGGIE	Yes.
BOB	Let me take you back inside, okay?

IKE	Ahh.
BOB	I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.

BOB	See you at the wedding.
IKE	You bet ya, Coach.

IKE	At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
BOB	Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.

BOB	What do you expect me to say to this?
IKE	How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?

BOB	You look awful.
IKE	Thank you.

IKE	Really?
BOB	I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
IKE	Got any last minute advice?
BOB	Maintain eye contact.

BRIAN	Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
MAGGIE	What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
BRIAN	Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
MAGGIE	What did he ask?

BRIAN	Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
MAGGIE	And what did you say?
BRIAN	How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
MAGGIE	Good one!  Thanks.
BRIAN	It happens to be how I feel.

MAGGIE	God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
BRIAN	God bless you, Maggie.

BRIAN	He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
MAGGIE	Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--

MAGGIE	I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
BRIAN	I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
MAGGIE	Of course.
BRIAN	Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
MAGGIE	Of course.

CINDY	That's it.  Back to obedience school.
MAGGIE	Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.

CINDY	And in a "V".
MAGGIE	Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.

CINDY	We do it to our dog.
MAGGIE	It's hurting.
CINDY	We'll rub.

CINDY	I'll get the dress.
MAGGIE	He's here!... He's here!

CINDY	Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
PEGGY	Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.

CINDY	Bob's in a hurry.
PEGGY	Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
CINDY	Sink the putt.
PEGGY	Make the shot.
CINDY	Nothing but net.
PEGGY	Never say die.

CINDY	I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
PEGGY	His hair... any color.

CINDY	Rub your ears.
PEGGY	Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.

IKE	Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
ELLIE	I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
IKE	So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?

ELLIE	-- It's for you, Ike.
IKE	What?
ELLIE	Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.

IKE	Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
ELLIE	That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
IKE	I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
ELLIE	Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?

ELLIE	No, that's what makes you unemployed.
IKE	I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.

IKE	Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
ELLIE	I already made an appointment for later today.
IKE	See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
ELLIE	I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.

ELLIE	Fisher, let him talk.
IKE	But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.

IKE	Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
ELLIE	No.  No, you didn't.

IKE	Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
ELLIE	I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.

IKE	Maggie!
ELLIE	Where do you think she's going?

FISHER	Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
ELLIE	... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
FISHER	Or a vegetarian?
ELLIE	Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.

ELLIE	Look, he's running after her.
FISHER	Look, he's in pretty good shape.
ELLIE	Poor Ike.

FISHER	Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
IKE	Since when does Ellie need moral supp--

FISHER	In vino veritas.
IKE	Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.

FISHER	Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
IKE	What are you trying to say to me, Fish?

FISHER	Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
IKE	The real story on Miss Carpenter.
FISHER	All the gory details.

IKE	The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
FISHER	It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
IKE	This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.

FISHER	If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
IKE	Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
FISHER	Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
IKE	Paid vindication  That's what I call justice.
FISHER	Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
IKE	But I'll get my normal fee, right?

FISHER	Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
IKE	Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.

FISHER	Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
IKE	This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
FISHER	No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
IKE	I don't know.

IKE	Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
FISHER	You're coming here?
IKE	Yeah.
FISHER	Then come for dinner.
IKE	Okay, we'll order out.
FISHER	Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...

IKE	No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
FISHER	Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?

FISHER	Of course we are.  Of course.
IKE	Then you'll be my best man.
FISHER	Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
IKE	Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.

FISHER	I have no idea what I'm doing.
IKE	Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
FISHER	I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?

IKE	Get this man a Kamikaze.
GEORGE	Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.

IKE	You could have told me you were fiance number three.
GEORGE	And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
IKE	Thanks.
GEORGE	She's a cacophony of contradictions.
IKE	Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
GEORGE	Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
IKE	Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
GEORGE	Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
IKE	Neuter a locust, feed the world.

GEORGE	Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
IKE	I don't think that's why she ran.
GEORGE	Why do YOU think she ran?

IKE	I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.
GEORGE	And you defending her?
IKE	No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
GEORGE	Unbelievable, she got to you.
IKE	Oh, please!

IKE	Sorry, no.  I just got one.
MRS. PRESSMAN	Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
IKE	Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
MRS. PRESSMAN	It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
IKE	I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?

MRS. PRESSMAN	I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
IKE	Good fact.  Well, you let me know.
MRS. PRESSMAN	Oh, I will.

IKE	Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
MRS. PRESSMAN	Tootaloo.

MRS. PRESSMAN	It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
IKE	No, I'm not.

IKE	Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
PEGGY	Are you a reporter?

IKE	What?
PEGGY	It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
IKE	About her upcoming wedding and all.
PEGGY	No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.

IKE	I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
PEGGY	Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.

PEGGY	And you are?
IKE	Looking for Maggie.
PEGGY	Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.

IKE	I think you'd look good in red.
PEGGY	No, she's talking about your hair.

PEGGY	Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
IKE	Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
PEGGY	This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
IKE	That must have made you proud.

IKE	It's nice that they're still friends.
PEGGY	Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...

IKE	Yes, I am.  And who are you?
MRS. TROUT	Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
IKE	Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
MRS. TROUT	-- The luau for Maggie.

MRS. TROUT	Your two cinnamon rolls.
IKE	Bye, Betty.  Thanks.

MRS. TROUT	You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
IKE	Thank you.
MRS. TROUT	Oh, come on.  You're practically family.

IKE	They made me put my hat back on.
WALTER	Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.

IKE	Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
WALTER	Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
IKE	You know, your daughter seems...

WALTER	Like her mother.
IKE	Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.

IKE	Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
WALTER	Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.

MAGGIE	I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
IKE	Originality is my speciality.
MAGGIE	Excellent.

MAGGIE	Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
IKE	You'll answer my questions?

IKE	Getting nervous?
MAGGIE	Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.

IKE	Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
MAGGIE	Yes.

IKE	I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
MAGGIE	You have one?

MAGGIE	Did something happen to make you care about reality?
IKE	Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
MAGGIE	You're going to be very disappointed.
IKE	We'll see.
MAGGIE	I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.

IKE	That's fair.
MAGGIE	Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.

IKE	Everest.  Is that right?
MAGGIE	Twice...
IKE	Really?
MAGGIE	Without oxygen...

IKE	How romantic.
MAGGIE	We think so.
IKE	Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.

MAGGIE	Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
IKE	A pre-wedding luau?

MAGGIE	Give me that!
IKE	But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.

IKE	Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
MAGGIE	He is not!

MAGGIE	You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
IKE	You can turn that finger around.

MAGGIE	You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
IKE	Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.

IKE	I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
MAGGIE	How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.

MAGGIE	You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
IKE	I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?

MAGGIE	My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
IKE	Really.

IKE	My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
MAGGIE	Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
IKE	You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
MAGGIE	Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.

IKE	Too much.
MAGGIE	Seven-fifty.
IKE	Five hundred.
MAGGIE	Six-fifty.
IKE	Done.

MAGGIE	It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
IKE	Cindy the manicurist.

MAGGIE	I think so.
IKE	I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
MAGGIE	Maybe someday.
IKE	You afraid to try?
MAGGIE	No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
IKE	Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
MAGGIE	What an incredible chauvinistic observation.

IKE	Always a mood killer.
MAGGIE	Still sweet.

IKE	It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
MAGGIE	He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.

MAGGIE	It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
IKE	Highly suspect.
MAGGIE	What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
IKE	Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.

IKE	I'm a work in progress.
MAGGIE	So?  Is that what you said to her?
IKE	No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
MAGGIE	Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?

IKE	I don't know.
MAGGIE	You don't know.
IKE	No.
MAGGIE	Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?

MAGGIE	Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
IKE	Agreed.

IKE	You look... uh... You look fine.
MAGGIE	Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
IKE	Bob will be very happy.

MAGGIE	I'll have the same.
IKE	Of course.
MAGGIE	What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?

IKE	Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
MAGGIE	You know, there's no...

MAGGIE	Ike... Hi, Grandma.
IKE	Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.

IKE	Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
MAGGIE	It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
IKE	It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
MAGGIE	No.  You take it.

IKE	Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
MAGGIE	No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.

MAGGIE	Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
IKE	Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.

MAGGIE	Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
IKE	Can you fix it?
MAGGIE	First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
IKE	Of what?
MAGGIE	Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.

IKE	Kind of isolated.
MAGGIE	Yeah.  It's kind of nice.

IKE	No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
MAGGIE	Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.

MAGGIE	Where did you disappear to?
IKE	Missed me bad, huh?

IKE	I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
MAGGIE	Excuse me?
IKE	Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
MAGGIE	Yes.
IKE	I don't and I don't think you should...

IKE	I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
MAGGIE	You humiliated me!
IKE	No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
MAGGIE	I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
IKE	Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.

MAGGIE	It's fun!  It's high.
IKE	Or the sexual habits of locusts?
MAGGIE	That was very interesting research George was doing!
IKE	What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
MAGGIE	I already explained about that.
IKE	And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
MAGGIE	Brian told you that?
IKE	Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
MAGGIE	Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
IKE	Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
MAGGIE	Lost!
IKE	That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
MAGGIE	What!?
IKE	With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
MAGGIE	That's called changing your mind.
IKE	No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
MAGGIE	Yes I do!
IKE	No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?

MAGGIE	No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
IKE	I'd rather not.
MAGGIE	Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.

IKE	I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
MAGGIE	I kissed him back.

MAGGIE	About a minute...?
IKE	A little longer for me.
MAGGIE	Really?

MAGGIE	Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
IKE	I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
MAGGIE	Me, either.

IKE	I love you.  I love you.
MAGGIE	I love you, too.

MAGGIE	To who?  Are you asking me?
IKE	Me?

MAGGIE	Yes, you!
IKE	Well, you do have the dress.
MAGGIE	And the church.
IKE	And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
MAGGIE	I'm okay with that.
IKE	So am I.
MAGGIE	So, we'll...

MAGGIE	I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
IKE	I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!

IKE	Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
MAGGIE	It's something I've always wanted to do.

IKE	You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
MAGGIE	I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.

IKE	Does it matter?
MAGGIE	I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
IKE	Yes, I did.
MAGGIE	I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.

IKE	Used?
MAGGIE	They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
IKE	This is getting serious.

IKE	You were not.
MAGGIE	I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
IKE	I'm listening.
MAGGIE	I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me.

IKE	Pretty good speech, Maggie.
MAGGIE	I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?

PEGGY	So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
MAGGIE	Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!

PEGGY	You're a goddess!
MAGGIE	I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
PEGGY	Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.

MAGGIE	Reporter?
PEGGY	Yup!

PEGGY	Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
MAGGIE	She's the boss.

MAGGIE	Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
PEGGY	For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
MAGGIE	That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
PEGGY	It's probably because you got him fired.
MAGGIE	Ya think?
PEGGY	Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!

MAGGIE	There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
PEGGY	Where?
MAGGIE	Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
PEGGY	He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.

PEGGY	Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
MAGGIE	Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
PEGGY	Yes.

PEGGY	I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
MAGGIE	On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?

MAGGIE	I'm going to kill myself.
PEGGY	Why?
MAGGIE	Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
PEGGY	No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
MAGGIE	But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
PEGGY	No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
MAGGIE	But I'm weird.
PEGGY	No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
MAGGIE	Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.

PEGGY	I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
MAGGIE	I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
PEGGY	Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
MAGGIE	It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.

PEGGY	You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
MAGGIE	Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?

PEGGY	Lighten up, wahine.
MAGGIE	Lighten up, what?
PEGGY	This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
MAGGIE	I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
PEGGY	Would it?

PEGGY	He's going to be the pastor?
MAGGIE	Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
PEGGY	What happened at the luau?
MAGGIE	... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
PEGGY	It's for the bell.

MAGGIE	Grandma!
PEGGY	See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.

MAGGIE	He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
PEGGY	No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
MAGGIE	You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
PEGGY	Not eight...

PEGGY	Let's go.
MAGGIE	No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.

PEGGY	You okay?  I'm closing.
MAGGIE	I'm just finishing up, too.
PEGGY	Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
MAGGIE	No, I'm just going to head home.
PEGGY	Okay.

MAGGIE	What are you talking about?
PEGGY	Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
MAGGIE	Thank you.  You still think that he was....
PEGGY	Quick.  Very quick.

WALTER	So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
MAGGIE	Not this one.  This one's on me.

MAGGIE	I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
WALTER	Good boy, Port Hole.
MAGGIE	His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
WALTER	I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.

WALTER	I'm really rooting for this one.
MAGGIE	Thank you, Dad.

WALTER	What?
MAGGIE	Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
WALTER	Maggie, it's just a joke...
MAGGIE	No.  It's my life.
WALTER	A harmless joke.
MAGGIE	No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.

PEGGY	What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar.... I can't ready anymore.
MRS. PRESSMAN	And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground  Holy moly.

MRS. PRESSMAN	You tell Maggie.
PEGGY	No, you tell her.
MRS. PRESSMAN	No, no.  You're her best friend.
PEGGY	No.
MRS. PRESSMAN	You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
PEGGY	Yeah.
MRS. PRESSMAN	Maybe she hasn't read the paper...

BISHOP O'HARA	Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Oh?
BISHOP O'HARA	I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Well... thank you.

BISHOP O'HARA	I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Perhaps.
BISHOP O'HARA	I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Really?

CHRISTY	Really.
CHARLENE	Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
CHRISTY	Well... yes.  Yes it is.

CHARLENE	Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
CHRISTY	Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.

CHRISTY	Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
CHARLENE	What about crack?  You a user?
CHRISTY	I said I was a nun, not an asshole.

CHOIR	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
CHRISTY	What you say?
CHOIR	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

CHRISTY	But how?
CHOIR	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
CHRISTY	I think I hear it!
CHOIR	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
CHRISTY	You know, I just might!
CHOIR	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

CHOIR	LET THY SPIRIT
CHRISTY	You know what we're saying!
CHOIR	LET THY SPIRIT
CHRISTY	I think they hear you!

CHRISTY	He's... dreamy.  He's...
CHOIR	Yes, Mary?
CHRISTY	HE'S SO FINE...

CHOIR	SING!
CHRISTY	Were you tempted?
CHOIR	SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!

CHRISTY	But I'm fearful!
CHOIR	SING!
CHRISTY	And I'm tearful!
CHOIR	SING!
CHRISTY	YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE

CHRISTY	So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
LAWANDA	We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.

LAWANDA	How come?  Sister?
CHRISTY	Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.

CHRISTY	Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
LAWANDA	'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
CHRISTY	Probation?

LAWANDA	Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
CHRISTY	And you listen to that?
LAWANDA	No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
CHRISTY	Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
LAWANDA	What you do?
CHRISTY	Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.

CHRISTY	How are you doing.
LAWANDA	Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
CHRISTY	You know it.

CHRISTY	What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
JOEY	You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
CHRISTY	Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.

CHRISTY	His ashes?
JOEY	With love.

JOEY	Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
CHRISTY	Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
JOEY	What?
CHRISTY	You can handle this.

JOEY	Okay, Christy -- strip.
CHRISTY	What?
JOEY	That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.

CHRISTY	Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
VINCE	What did who say?
CHRISTY	Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.

VINCE	You are so damn sexy.
CHRISTY	Vince...
VINCE	How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
CHRISTY	Today was the deadline, Vince.

VINCE	I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
CHRISTY	You did what?

VINCE	For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
CHRISTY	You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
VINCE	He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.

CHRISTY	What? 
VINCE	You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
CHRISTY	You bastard!
VINCE	We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
CHRISTY	You pig!

VINCE	Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
CHRISTY	You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?

CHRISTY	No... it's fine.
VINCE	Yes?
CHRISTY	Thanks.  A lot.
VINCE	Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
CHRISTY	Sure.
VINCE	And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
CHRISTY	Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.

VINCE	Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
CHRISTY	Good evening, Vincent.
VINCE	What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
CHRISTY	I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.

VINCE	She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
CHRISTY	I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.

CHRISTY	Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
VINCE	Joey -- do it.

VINCE	I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
CHRISTY	That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...

CHRISTY	Oh, girls.
RONELLES	Yes, Betty?
CHRISTY	This prom is a real drag.
RONELLES	Oh-huh.
CHRISTY	Oh my! 
RONELLES	What is it, Betty?
CHRISTY	Look at that.  Get a gander.
RONELLES	Oh my! 
CHRISTY	He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
RONELLES	Yes, Betty?
CHRISTY	HE'S SO FINE.
RONELLES	D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
CHRISTY	WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.

MARY PATRICK	Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
CHRISTY	Right.

CHRISTY	Where did that come from?
MARY PATRICK	I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?

MARY PATRICK	1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
CHRISTY	No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING

MARY PATRICK	The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
CHRISTY	Not in years.
MARY PATRICK	Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
CHRISTY	Why?
MARY PATRICK	To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
CHRISTY	But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?

MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
CHRISTY	Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
MARY PATRICK	Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
CHRISTY	Just about.  Show me again.
MARY PATRICK	You betcha.

MARY PATRICK	Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
CHRISTY	I love my heddles.  Show me again.

CHRISTY	Is this... choir practice?
MARY PATRICK	Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.

CHRISTY	Hold on.
MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?

CHRISTY	You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
MARY PATRICK	Chops?
CHRISTY	The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.

MARY PATRICK	Two days.  An hour or so.
CHRISTY	No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.

CHRISTY	That machine.
MARY PATRICK	I know.  It's ancient.
CHRISTY	It's a rhythm section.  The beat.

CHRISTY	Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
MARY PATRICK	The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
CHRISTY	Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
MARY PATRICK	Am I?

MARY PATRICK	All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
CHRISTY	So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.

MARY PATRICK	SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
CHRISTY	Because we're

MARY PATRICK	We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.
CHRISTY	And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.

MARY PATRICK	What is it, Mary?
CHRISTY	That man -- who is he?

CHRISTY	Jackpot!  Two buckets
MARY PATRICK	This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.

MARY PATRICK	Hurry, Sister!
CHRISTY	Get moving.  I'm right behind you.

MARY PATRICK	MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
CHRISTY	It's true -- I know her.
MARY PATRICK	DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
CHRISTY	What a shame!
MARY PATRICK	BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
CHRISTY	Pay attention...
MARY PATRICK	SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
CHRISTY	Were you wicked?

CHRISTY	Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
MARY LAZARUS	Enough jabber.

CHRISTY	What?
MARY LAZARUS	Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
CHRISTY	Like this place?
MARY LAZARUS	I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.

MARY LAZARUS	Shirelles.
CHRISTY	You know that song?

MARY LAZARUS	Soprano or alto?
CHRISTY	Whatever.

MARY LAZARUS	Mary Clarence, are you with us?
CHRISTY	Um, I don't really know this one...

CHRISTY	Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
MARY LAZARUS	Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
CHRISTY	What?
MARY LAZARUS	You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.

MARY LAZARUS	Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
CHRISTY	Mary Robert.

CHRISTY	Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
MARY LAZARUS	I knew that.
CHRISTY	Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.

MARY LAZARUS	Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
CHRISTY	I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?

CHRISTY	I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
MARY LAZARUS	Wet behind the ears.
CHRISTY	A bunch of real mama's girls.

CHRISTY	It'll be hell.
MARY LAZARUS	Tell me about it.

CHRISTY	Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
MARY LAZARUS	Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
CHRISTY	Hopeless I
MARY LAZARUS	Amateurs 2
CHRISTY	Babies
MARY LAZARUS	Again!

MARY LAZARUS	She's a pro.
CHRISTY	What?

MARY LAZARUS	Is there any syrup?
CHRISTY	Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.

MARY LAZARUS	We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
CHRISTY	That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.

MARY LAZARUS	Van Cartier.
CHRISTY	You know?  About me?  About everything?

CHRISTY	Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
MARY LAZARUS	You re okay -- for a civilian.

MARY LAZARUS	JUST SING!
CHRISTY	Sing!

MARY ROBERT	Come on, we're late.
CHRISTY	What?  What time is it?
MARY ROBERT	It's after five.  We have to bathe.
CHRISTY	Five a.m.?

CHRISTY	What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
MARY ROBERT	I... I...

CHRISTY	What?
MARY ROBERT	I... I brought you something.
CHRISTY	A cigarette?
MARY ROBERT	An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.

CHRISTY	Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
MARY ROBERT	Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
CHRISTY	Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.

CHRISTY	So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
MARY ROBERT	Three years.  Sister.
CHRISTY	Three years.  A rookie.
MARY ROBERT	A novice.
CHRISTY	Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?

MARY ROBERT	You have to help me
CHRISTY	Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
MARY ROBERT	No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
CHRISTY	Excuse me?
MARY ROBERT	Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
CHRISTY	She won't?  Why not?
MARY ROBERT	She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
CHRISTY	She said that?  Reverend Mother?

CHRISTY	Well, then there's only one thing to do.
MARY ROBERT	What?
CHRISTY	Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.

CHRISTY	We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
MARY ROBERT	Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
CHRISTY	We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
MARY ROBERT	Are you sure?

MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
CHRISTY	Now you.

MARY ROBERT	We need experience.
CHRISTY	It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.

CHRISTY	Bobs
MARY ROBERT	Experience!  Right?
CHRISTY	Right.

MARY ROBERT	I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
CHRISTY	Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
MARY ROBERT	Really?

MARY ROBERT	Who are all these people?
CHRISTY	This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.

MARY ROBERT	I'm getting experience.
CHRISTY	You watch yourself!

MARY ROBERT	Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
CHRISTY	Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
CHRISTY	Honey.

MARY ROBERT	I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
CHRISTY	Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.

MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
CHRISTY	Keep moving!

CHRISTY	Goddamn it!
MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!

MARY ROBERT	Oh my Lord!
CHRISTY	Experience!

MARY ROBERT	What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
CHRISTY	I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
MARY ROBERT	We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!

CHRISTY	Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
MARY ROBERT	Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.

MARY ROBERT	What?
CHRISTY	Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
MARY ROBERT	I don't want to mess anyone up...
CHRISTY	Give me a C.  A C!

CHRISTY	WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
MARY ROBERT	HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU

CHRISTY	Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
MARY ROBERT	We're nuns!

CHRISTY	It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
MARY ROBERT	A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.

MARY ROBERT	Are you leaving us?
CHRISTY	Oh no.  We'll always be together.

MARY ROBERT	The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
CHRISTY	Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?

MARY ROBERT	Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
CHRISTY	They're from my old convent.

CHRISTY	Run!  Take off!
MARY ROBERT	Again?

MARY ROBERT	But what do they want?  Where are we going?
CHRISTY	She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.

MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence!
CHRISTY	Bless you.

MARY ROBERT	I WAS DOWNHEARTED
CHRISTY	It's true!
MARY ROBERT	I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
CHRISTY	Don't you know it!
MARY ROBERT	BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
CHRISTY	What did He say?
MARY ROBERT	HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!

CHRISTY	A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
CHRISTY	Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your name?
CHRISTY	Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Enough joking.
CHRISTY	That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Very well.
CHRISTY	Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!

MOTHER SUPERIOR	St. Anne's?
CHRISTY	Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	You were unhappy?
CHRISTY	I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	The reason?
CHRISTY	Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I see.
CHRISTY	You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sit down.
CHRISTY	What?

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Miss Van Cartier.
CHRISTY	What? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your cigarette -- out.

MOTHER SUPERIOR	It has come to pass.
CHRISTY	What?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
CHRISTY	Are you talking about me?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	And all those like you.
CHRISTY	You mean black people?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
CHRISTY	What's a concubine?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Check your driver's license.

CHRISTY	Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Of course.  But it's almost lunch.

CHRISTY	Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
CHRISTY	Deal.

CHRISTY	How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Would you like that?

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
CHRISTY	Can do.

CHRISTY	No!  No!  I can't do this!
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
CHRISTY	But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
MOTHER SUPERIOR	As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
CHRISTY	Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?

MOTHER SUPERIOR	The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
CHRISTY	No problem.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	The vow of obedience.
CHRISTY	Like to who?

MOTHER SUPERIOR	And the vow of chastity.
CHRISTY	I'm outta here.

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
CHRISTY	A what?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
CHRISTY	Silence?  No talking?  All day?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Until sundown.

MOTHER SUPERIOR	As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
CHRISTY	A what?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
CHRISTY	No food?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	No food.  Not until sundown.

CHRISTY	Is this all the food I get?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes.  Until breakfast.
CHRISTY	That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?

MOTHER SUPERIOR	This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
CHRISTY	My what?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your cell.  Your room.

CHRISTY	You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
CHRISTY	Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Useless distractions.
CHRISTY	It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	And whom would you call?
CHRISTY	Oh, I don't know... Satan?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Your cell is more than adequate.
CHRISTY	Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
CHRISTY	Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
CHRISTY	What's wrong with my life?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 

CHRISTY	Yeah?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
CHRISTY	I got it.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Come, Sister.

CHRISTY	Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence!

MOTHER SUPERIOR	A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
CHRISTY	Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
CHRISTY	Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
MOTHER SUPERIOR	We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.

CHRISTY	Sometimes it's not enough!
MOTHER SUPERIOR	You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
CHRISTY	It never solves anything.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
CHRISTY	In English?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."

CHRISTY	Really catching on.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.

CHRISTY	I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
CHRISTY	Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!

CHRISTY	So... hi there.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
CHRISTY	Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
CHRISTY	I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
CHRISTY	A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
CHRISTY	But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
CHRISTY	I am?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
CHRISTY	What?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.

MOTHER SUPERIOR	You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
CHRISTY	No.  No.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	You're my Olympic event.
CHRISTY	Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
MOTHER SUPERIOR	The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.

CHRISTY	I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
CHRISTY	Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
CHRISTY	Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Out of the question.
CHRISTY	Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.

MOTHER SUPERIOR	And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
CHRISTY	What do you mean?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.

CHRISTY	Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
CHRISTY	A vote?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?

CHRISTY	But... wait a minute...
MOTHER SUPERIOR	The majority has spoken.

CHRISTY	You sent for me?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	You have a phone call.

CHRISTY	Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
CHRISTY	What?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
CHRISTY	But -- why?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I must go where I can be of use.
CHRISTY	But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
CHRISTY	But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
MOTHER SUPERIOR	A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.

MOTHER SUPERIOR	You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
CHRISTY	Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
CHRISTY	But...
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Good day.

CHRISTY	What are you doing here?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Saving you.  Move!

CHRISTY	Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Oh?
CHRISTY	You saved my life.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I'm a Christian.

CHRISTY	Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.

CHRISTY	I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
CHRISTY	What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
CHRISTY	Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Don't push it.

EDDIE	From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
CHRISTY	At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
EDDIE	I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
CHRISTY	Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
EDDIE	So I don't shop.
CHRISTY	'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
EDDIE	Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!

CHRISTY	He's a businessman.
EDDIE	A what? When are you qonna wake up?
CHRISTY	When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
EDDIE	Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
CHRISTY	Think again!  And get out of here.

CHRISTY	Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
EDDIE	You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
CHRISTY	I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!

CHRISTY	I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
EDDIE	He didn't do you a favor.
CHRISTY	Screw you!

CHRISTY	And if I don't?
EDDIE	Then-you run.

CHRISTY	Ten flights?
EDDIE	You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
CHRISTY	All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
EDDIE	Get a stenographer.

CHRISTY	Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
EDDIE	Maybe Hawaii.

EDDIE	Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
CHRISTY	Okay -- no limo.
EDDIE	No nothing.
CHRISTY	What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
EDDIE	I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.

CHRISTY	I hate you.  I totally hate you.
EDDIE	Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?

CHRISTY	Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
EDDIE	It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
CHRISTY	With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.

EDDIE	And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
CHRISTY	But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
EDDIE	Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
CHRISTY	I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
EDDIE	Pray. 

CHRISTY	Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
EDDIE	Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
CHRISTY	But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
EDDIE	Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
CHRISTY	Like what?
EDDIE	Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
CHRISTY	You son-of-a-bitch!

EDDIE	I just need a few more weeks,
CHRISTY	But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!

CHRISTY	Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
EDDIE	Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.

CHRISTY	What'd she say?
EDDIE	You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
CHRISTY	Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
EDDIE	She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
CHRISTY	So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
EDDIE	Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.

CHRISTY	Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
EDDIE	What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
CHRISTY	It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
EDDIE	You're supposed to be hiding out!
CHRISTY	I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
EDDIE	Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
CHRISTY	I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.
EDDIE	Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
CHRISTY	I am?
EDDIE	Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
CHRISTY	Really?  Lieutenant?
EDDIE	I've been worried about you.

CHRISTY	You mean -- worried about my testimony?
EDDIE	No -- worried about you.  Personally.

CHRISTY	Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
EDDIE	Me too.
CHRISTY	You're not... seeing anybody?
EDDIE	No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
CHRISTY	I have?
EDDIE	You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...

CHRISTY	I've got to go.
EDDIE	Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
CHRISTY	I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.

EDDIE	Vince knows you're here.
CHRISTY	How?
EDDIE	Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!

CHRISTY	I can't go with you.
EDDIE	What?
CHRISTY	I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
EDDIE	You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!

CHRISTY	Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
EDDIE	I think they'd understand.
CHRISTY	That's not the point!  They need me!

EDDIE	They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
CHRISTY	You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
EDDIE	Nuns?

EDDIE	What're you doing?
CHRISTY	Even nuns have to pee.

EDDIE	Don't you have a concert to go to?
CHRISTY	That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.

CHRISTY	Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
EDDIE	I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
CHRISTY	Yeah, like what?

CHRISTY	Hey, girls.
MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT	Hail, Mary.
CHRISTY	Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT	Oh-huh.
CHRISTY	People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT	Really.
CHRISTY	But -- wait.

EDDIE	We could put you into our witness protection program.
TATE	A hiding place.

EDDIE	Then one day they find you.
TATE	They open a window.

EDDIE	Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
TATE	Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
EDDIE	Where's who?
TATE	You won't even tell us?
EDDIE	I wouldn't even tell the Pope.

JOEY	We're looking for Mike.
MIKE	You found him -- but we're not open yet.

JOEY	I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
MIKE	Who are you guys?
JOEY	We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.

MIKE	But you didn't tell me!
JOEY	We didn't tell you what?
MIKE	That she's a nun!  That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!

JOEY	A nun?
MIKE	I'm telling you!

JOEY	Vince -- is she... okay?
VINCE	Maybe. 

JOEY	And if she runs?
VINCE	Take care of it.

VINCE	He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
JOEY	It's a bluff, Vince.
VINCE	You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.

VINCE	It's done?
JOEY	Not... totally.
VINCE	What's the problem?

JOEY	But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
VINCE	It didn't happen.

VINCE	I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
JOEY	Yeah...

VINCE	Well?
JOEY	It didn't work, Vince.
VINCE	You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.

JOEY	Right.
VINCE	So, take it off.

VINCE	I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
JOEY	Maybe pants.

VINCE	Get her!
JOEY	Which one!

VINCE	There she is!
JOEY	Which one?

JOEY	I can't see anything in here!
VINCE	Willy -- hit the lights.

VINCE	Joey?
JOEY	Where is she?

JOEY	But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
VINCE	She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!

JOEY	So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
WILLY	Yeah, right -- when I see it.

JOEY	She's gettin' away!
WILLY	Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!

WILLY	She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
JOEY	No smart-ass remarks or nothing.

JOEY	You didn't shoot!
WILLY	Neither did you!
JOEY	I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
WILLY	That's what I figured, too.

WILLY	Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?
JOEY	For like, twelve zillion eternities?

WILLY	A sweater.
JOEY	And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.

WILLY	What's she doing?
JOEY	She's praying.

MARY PATRICK	Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
MARY LAZARUS	Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.

MARY PATRICK	It should be here any minute.
MARY LAZARUS	Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.

MARY PATRICK	We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
MARY LAZARUS	We're losing it.

MARY PATRICK	Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
MARY LAZARUS	That should have tipped us.

MARY PATRICK	We've got to save her!
MARY LAZARUS	We can't leave it up to the Feds!

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes, Mary Patrick?
MARY PATRICK	Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Sister Mary Patrick?
MARY PATRICK	Yes?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
MARY PATRICK	Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -

MARY PATRICK	Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Really...

MOTHER SUPERIOR	She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
MARY PATRICK	But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?

MARY PATRICK	She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.

MARY PATRICK	Peace on Earth.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	However, we can also pray for other things.
MARY PATRICK	Measles.

MARY ROBERT	Is this like your old convent?
MARY PATRICK	Which convent was that, Sister?

MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.
MARY PATRICK	Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?

MARY PATRICK	We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
MARY ROBERT	That was exciting!

MARY PATRICK	He's not like other guys.
MARY ROBERT	He's decent.
MARY PATRICK	He's kind.

MARY ROBERT	I'd rather sing than do anything!
MARY PATRICK	It's better than ice cream.
MARY ROBERT	It's better than springtime.

MARY PATRICK	But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
MARY ROBERT	It's brought people back to the church.

MARY ROBERT	Ice cream!
MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?

MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
MARY PATRICK	Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.

MARY PATRICK	Mary Clarence!  Sister!
MARY ROBERT	It's no use.  She just isn't here.

MARY ROBERT	We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
MARY PATRICK	We'll pray -- and she'll be there.

MARY PATRICK	You mean -- they kidnapped her?
MARY ROBERT	Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.

MARY ROBERT	An... entertainer?
MARY PATRICK	She wasn't a nun?

MARY ROBERT	Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
MARY PATRICK	She's our inspiration!

MARY PATRICK	It's so beautiful...
MARY ROBERT	And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...

MARY ROBERT	The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
MARY PATRICK	But how do we get there?

MARY PATRICK	Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
MARY ROBERT	A Benedictine.

MARY ROBERT	Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
MARY PATRICK	Christy.

MARY ROBERT	Not a note.
MARY PATRICK	Impossible.

MARY ROBERT	I don't understand.  Where is she?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
MARY ROBERT	She said they were from her old convent.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.

MARY ROBERT	Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	But where?

MARY ROBERT	Reverend Mother?
MOTHER SUPERIOR	Yes?
MARY ROBERT	Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?

MOTHER SUPERIOR	Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
O'HARA	We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.

MOTHER SUPERIOR	But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
O'HARA	And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
O'HARA	Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	But, Bishop...
O'HARA	St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
MOTHER SUPERIOR	I lied.
O'HARA	I know. 

MOTHER SUPERIOR	But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
O'HARA	And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.

WILLY	I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
VINCE	She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.

VINCE	Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
WILLY	It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
VINCE	Can you hold?  Can you try?

WILLY	She's a nun, Vince.
VINCE	I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?

VINCE	And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
WILLY	She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.

WILLY	She's... she's a nun.
VINCE	Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!

WILLY	We both missed.
VINCE	Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?

WILLY	Where?
VINCE	Find 'em!

AMY	You know what I love about all this?
KAT	Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
AMY	Exactly! Todays my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.

AMY	Perfect. All ginny.
KAT	Except its Scotch.
AMY	But Im not taking your name, buster. Im a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!

AMY	Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
KAT	Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?

KAT	Christ, Amy.
AMY	Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
KAT	Drunk isnt the same thing as happy, Amy.

KAT	Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
AMY	Bacardi 151.

AMY	I dont think I can go through with this.
KAT	Pub Golf?
AMY	The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I dont think I should be allowed to get married.

KAT	Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
AMY	When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
KAT	But I do. I will. Youre my sister.

AMY	God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
KAT	What? Why? What do you mean?

AMY	I should get going.
KAT	Are you sure youre okay?
AMY	Im fine. I promise.

KAT	We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
AMY	So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
KAT	You practically bribed him with your erector set.

AMY	Hey.
KAT	Hey.

AMY	You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
KAT	Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.

KAT	Wow. You look beautiful.
AMY	Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.

AMY	Fred Astaire and whats her face!
NICK	Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.

NICK	Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
AMY	What for?
NICK	To make sure youre okay.

AMY	You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
NICK	Actually, I do.

AMY	It was such a long time ago.
NICK	Still--
AMY	If Ed ever found out....
NICK	Or Kat....
AMY	And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.

ED	Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
AMY	Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
ED	Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.

AMY	Say something. Please.
ED	I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.

ED	Does Kat know?
AMY	Jeffrey told her last night.
ED	Last night?

KAT	Wheres Nick sleeping?
BUNNY	Why, with you.
KAT	My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks its--

KAT	Huh?
BUNNY	Im not as square as my daughter thinks.

KAT	Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
BUNNY	Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
KAT	Sir, yes, sir!

KAT	Id be happy to. Youre welcome.
BUNNY	Oh, dont be that way.

BUNNY	I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
KAT	Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
BUNNY	Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.

KAT	She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
BUNNY	It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.

BUNNY	Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.
KAT	So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.

BUNNY	Whats going on with you two?
KAT	I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
BUNNY	Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
KAT	Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
BUNNY	Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
KAT	Mom, please.
BUNNY	Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
KAT	She did?
BUNNY	So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.

ED	Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
NICK	Um, just about everyone.
ED	You are taking the piss?

ED	Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.
NICK	Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.

ED	I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
NICK	Im a hooker.

ED	I thought you said you were crap.
NICK	I had to say something to get you here.
ED	Fair enough, but Im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...

NICK	Ill just check into a hotel.
ED	Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.

ED	I look like a total wanker, dont I?
NICK	Yeah, kind of.

ED	You heading to the train station?
NICK	I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
ED	Yeah.

JEFFREY	Whats his problem?
ED	What?
JEFFREY	Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
ED	Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
JEFFREY	No, thats not it.

JEFFREY	Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
ED	No.
JEFFREY	It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
ED	Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
JEFFREY	And Kat was fully clothed.
ED	But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
JEFFREY	Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
ED	Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
JEFFREY	Lasik surgeon, actually.

JEFFREY	I didnt deserve her back then.
ED	And you do now?

JEFFREY	Nothing.
ED	Doesnt look like nothing.

NICK	Hey.
JEFFREY	Oh, hello.

JEFFREY	Ah, a philosopher.
NICK	Shrink, actually.
JEFFREY	Crikey.
NICK	What?
JEFFREY	Nothing, nothing.
NICK	No, tell me.
JEFFREY	You Yanks and your therapy. Its great.  Its all a bit too touchy-feely for me.

NICK	Hey, man.
JEFFREY	Sorry, can you give us a moment?
NICK	No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later.

KAT	Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
JEFFREY	Hello, Katmandu.

JEFFREY	Seeing you again....
KAT	Yeah?

JEFFREY	Hey, Kat.
KAT	Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.

KAT	Hey, you!
JEFFREY	Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
KAT	Maybe not her least... Theres always--

KAT	So, tell me, hows unmarried life?
JEFFREY	I have regrets.

KAT	Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
JEFFREY	Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
KAT	Its called character. God, youre predictable.
JEFFREY	Is that why you brought him? Because of me.

JEFFREY	Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
KAT	Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
JEFFREY	Kat, stop it. You do. You cant even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.

KAT	That was a long time ago.
JEFFREY	It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
KAT	So, whats your point?
JEFFREY	I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.

JEFFREY	You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
KAT	Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
JEFFREY	Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
KAT	Not for a dog.
JEFFREY	Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...

KAT	Is this supposed to be an apology?
JEFFREY	Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--

JEFFREY	Youre not even listening.
KAT	When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.

JEFFREY	Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
KAT	Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
JEFFREY	Brilliant.
KAT	Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.

KAT	Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
JEFFREY	I slept with your sister.

KAT	Im sorry?
JEFFREY	I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.

KAT	Hi. Hey.
NICK	Kat.

NICK	You think we look like were trying too hard.
KAT	Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.

NICK	What color are my shoes?
KAT	You have feet?

KAT	Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
NICK	Youre funny.
KAT	Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, its way better to look hot while youre doing it.

NICK	Mission accomplished.
KAT	Really?  Dont get too attached.

NICK	Mmm.
KAT	Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
NICK	Both.

NICK	You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
KAT	I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.

NICK	The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
KAT	Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.

KAT	Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
NICK	Love.

KAT	Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
NICK	He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
KAT	Of course he is. Im here with my new man.  I love it! Your magics already working. Let the suffering begin.

KAT	What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
NICK	I dont know.
KAT	What does your gut say?
NICK	Youre too good for him.

KAT	No, count it, anyway.
NICK	Why?
KAT	Im compulsive and weird?

KAT	Six thousand, right?
NICK	On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
KAT	How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
NICK	Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
KAT	That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
NICK	Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.

NICK	You quitting?
KAT	Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.

NICK	Who are they?
KAT	Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.

KAT	What?
NICK	Its cute.
KAT	What is?
NICK	You stand on your tiptoes.
KAT	I do?

KAT	Have you ever done anything like this before?
NICK	A weekend?
KAT	A wedding.

NICK	Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
KAT	I think thats disgusting.

KAT	Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
NICK	Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.

KAT	Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
NICK	This happened to you?
KAT	Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.

NICK	How did you know that was me?
KAT	I have a friend at the magazine.
NICK	Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
KAT	If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.

NICK	Would you grab my shampoo?
KAT	Shampoo, got it!

NICK	The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
KAT	Oh, no.
NICK	Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.

KAT	You shit!
NICK	I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
KAT	And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
NICK	Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.

KAT	So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
NICK	First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all--

NICK	Yes.
KAT	What?!
NICK	When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....

NICK	Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
KAT	I guess so.
NICK	What do you think?

NICK	Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
KAT	My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.

NICK	I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
KAT	This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.

NICK	Dont stop asking questions, okay?
KAT	Okay.

NICK	I swear. I dont have a signature move.
KAT	Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.

KAT	Subtle?
NICK	I disappear. Its not about me.

NICK	Its hard to explain.
KAT	Show me.

KAT	Come on.
NICK	Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.

KAT	Are you sure?
NICK	We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.

NICK	Is this for last night?
KAT	Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
NICK	If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.

NICK	Dont they have a limit at those machines?
KAT	Not if you take an advance on your credit card.

KAT	So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!
NICK	Not dollars. Pounds.

KAT	And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
NICK	No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
KAT	What?
NICK	Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
KAT	But nothing did.
NICK	Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.

NICK	Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
KAT	Oh, cut the crap!
NICK	I just hate seeing you so stuck.
KAT	He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
NICK	You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.

KAT	Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
NICK	Its my job.

KAT	You have had girlfriends?
NICK	Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.

NICK	When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
KAT	So, whyd you say yes to me?
NICK	There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
KAT	Desperation?

KAT	What would you do if you weren't an escort?
NICK	Make out with you for free.

NICK	What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
KAT	Spontaneously combust?

NICK	Yeah. You?
KAT	Yeah.

NICK	Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
KAT	I didnt say he was worth it.

NICK	And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
KAT	He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
NICK	So whats with the nickname?

NICK	Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
KAT	Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
NICK	Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, well go back to the real world and...and youll be hiring me for your best friend!

KAT	You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
NICK	Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?

KAT	Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
NICK	Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.

NICK	Hi.
KAT	Hi.

NICK	I should go.
KAT	What?! No, no. You cant--
NICK	I have to.  Im the best man.

NICK	Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.
KAT	Thank you.

TJ	Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
KAT	You have more than one gynecologist?
TJ	Sure. Youve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youre easy.

KAT	You didnt have to do that.
TJ	I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.

TJ	Whats he do anyway?
KAT	Therapist.

TJ	Like fifteen.
KAT	Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.

TJ	Oh, no. He told you.
KAT	You knew?
TJ	Im so sorry.

KAT	Hey, Sal.
SAL	I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
KAT	I get all the glamour jobs.

SAL	The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
KAT	Give it back? Are you nuts?
SAL	You pawned it.
KAT	Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.

SAL	You want I nut him in the boat?
KAT	Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
SAL	You want me to let him in?
KAT	Of course, dont be silly.

KAT	Dad!
VICTOR	Hi, kiddo.
KAT	Meet Nick.

KAT	Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
VICTOR	Ahoy!

VICTOR	So whyd you let him go?
KAT	Its complicated, Dad.
VICTOR	Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.

KAT	Yeah.
VICTOR	Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.

KAT	Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
WOODY	Just drunk enough.

WOODY	Not yet...
KAT	...but its getting there. 

KAT	I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
WOODY	Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.

WOODY	I always wondered what happened with us.
KAT	I havent thought about that in years.

KAT	Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
WOODY	Hard.

NICK	Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
VICTOR	Is there any other way to take it?

NICK	I am now, sir.
VICTOR	At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.

VICTOR	What is it you do again?
NICK	What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.

VICTOR	What do you say to that?
NICK	I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.

VICTOR	Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
NICK	--and The ass of The man who adores her.

VICTOR	Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
NICK	Will do.

CLEO	Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
KANSAS	Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?

CLEO	What?!
KANSAS	You piece-a-shit bug zapper!

CLEO	I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
KANSAS	You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.

KANSAS	Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
CLEO	I just pulled and it - it came off.
KANSAS	This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
CLEO	Look, it's really not my fault.

KANSAS	Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!
CLEO	Sorry, Kansas...
KANSAS	NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
CLEO	Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
KANSAS	Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."

CLEO	Holy shit.
LUCY	You just became a statistic!

CLEO	I'm in, too.
LUCY	Cleo!
CLEO	Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.

CLEO	And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
LUCY	Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
CLEO	Conan went to Harvard.

CLEO	Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
LUCY	It's twins!!

CLEO	Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
LUCY	Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.

CLEO	Another sex dream?
DIANE	Wayne Gretzky.

CLEO	Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
DIANE	Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.

CLEO	...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
DIANE	Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
CLEO	Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.

CLEO	Di, we're sorry.  We...
DIANE	It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!

CLEO	Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
DIANE	Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....

CLEO	Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
DIANE	My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
CLEO	I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...

DIANE	Hello?
CLEO	Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
DIANE	Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
CLEO	Bye.

LUCY	Diane?  Diane!
DIANE	Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.

LUCY	Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
DIANE	No...I've been pregnant.

LUCY	Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
DIANE	No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
LUCY	Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
DIANE	You sure?
LUCY	Positive.
DIANE	Positive you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...

LUCY	Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
DIANE	Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?

DIANE	C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
LUCY	And they get caught!
DIANE	That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.

LUCY	No.
DIANE	If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
LUCY	... I don't know.  Probably not.
DIANE	So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
LUCY	Well...

LUCY	But, we have to make a smart plan!
DIANE	Of course - of course!  Hands in...

LUCY	Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
DIANE	Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...

LUCY	-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
DIANE	That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!

LUCY	Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
DIANE	She thinks you went to the police.
LUCY	WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
DIANE	I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.

DIANE	Hi, Jack.
JACK	Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.

DIANE	... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
JACK	I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
DIANE	Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
JACK	Spit from your dad?
DIANE	I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
JACK	Yeah.
DIANE	So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
JACK	Y'think?
DIANE	I sure do.
JACK	Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
DIANE	Oh, Jack...

DIANE	Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
JACK	But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.

JACK	Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
DIANE	Jack...
JACK	If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
DIANE	Trix...
JACK	Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!

DIANE	Jack, I think I should get a job.
JACK	But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
DIANE	I know, but that was before.
JACK	Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.

JACK	I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
DIANE	Mmm-hmmm...

DIANE	If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
JACK	Huh?  Oh Jesus...

DIANE	Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
JACK	Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.

JACK	...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
DIANE	That was gas, Sweetie.
JACK	Oh... What are you working on?
DIANE	Jus some girlie things for the squad.

LOAN OFFICER	I'm sorry.
DIANE	What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
LOAN OFFICER	Let me explain something...
DIANE	No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
LOAN OFFICER	Uh, yes.  Yes you did.

DIANE	...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
LOAN OFFICER	Sorry.  My hands are tied.

KANSAS	Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
DIANE	Well, I want to know what happened --

KANSAS	Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
DIANE	I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"

DIANE	Madonna.
KANSAS	We're here for you, Diane.

KANSAS	Hat-trick?
DIANE	He is the Great One...

DIANE	No you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
KANSAS	Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
DIANE	You sure I'm not fat?

DIANE	Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
KANSAS	Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
DIANE	And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...

KANSAS	Shut up.
DIANE	Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?

DIANE	Kansas!
KANSAS	I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --

DIANE	It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
KANSAS	Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.

DIANE	Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
KANSAS	Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!

DIANE	NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
KANSAS	We were told you could "fix us up."

KANSAS	Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
DIANE	Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?

DIANE	Oh no...
KANSAS	He Ikea'd us.

KANSAS	It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
DIANE	Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
KANSAS	She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
KANSAS	That you?
DIANE	Yeah, hold on.
KANSAS	Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
DIANE	Don't use big bills!
KANSAS	For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.

DIANE	Yeah?
DIM SUM CHARLIE	Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
DIANE	Hello?
DIM SUM CHARLIE	Kim-Lo?
DIANE	No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
DIANE	Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
DIM SUM CHARLIE	Wrong number  Nooooooo!

HANK	Yeah?
DIANE	I guess there's an exception to every rule.

DIANE	Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
HANK	Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
DIANE	Ammo?
HANK	Bullets.
DIANE	Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
HANK	Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.

DIANE	Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
HANK	Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.

HANK	My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
DIANE	You're kidding.
HANK	Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.

DIANE	... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
HANNAH	I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

HANNAH	I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
DIANE	I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...

HANNAH	You want us to help you pick up?
DIANE	Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!

DIANE	And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
HANNAH	Or, I could get my own horse...
DIANE	Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!

HANNAH	Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
DIANE	That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.

DIANE	Hello?
HANNAH	We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
DIANE	Hannah, we've...
HANNAH	It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
DIANE	Ooops, hold on a sec.

HANNAH	...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
DIANE	Hold on...

KANSAS	Screw Lucy!
GRANDMOTHER	Kansas?

GRANDMOTHER	Is that you down there?
KANSAS	Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
GRANDMOTHER	Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
KANSAS	Oh yeah, you caught us...

GRANDMOTHER	Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
KANSAS	Thanks!  That'd be great.

GRANDMOTHER	You got that big retarded girl down there?
KANSAS	Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
GRANDMOTHER	Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
KANSAS	I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
GRANDMOTHER	You damn well better...

HANK	Really...
LUCY	Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
HANK	She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
LUCY	Definitely old.
HANK	That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?

LUCY	Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
HANK	Maybe we can make a deal.

KANSAS	Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
HANNAH	Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.

HANNAH	Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
KANSAS	Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."

KANSAS	Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
HANNAH	But you're not married.

HANNAH	...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
KANSAS	Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
HANNAH	I'm only allowed "G" movies.
KANSAS	Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"

KANSAS	You sure you wanna go there?
HANNAH	Uh...maybe?
KANSAS	'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"

KANSAS	Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
HANNAH	Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.

KANSAS	All of you!
HANNAH	Bank branch!

KANSAS	Bank branch!
HANNAH	All of you!

KANSAS	Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
MRS. HILL	Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.

KANSAS	You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
MRS. HILL	I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
KANSAS	They could kill you.
MRS. HILL	So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
KANSAS	I don't hate you.  I need your help.
MRS. HILL	My what?
KANSAS	Your help.
MRS. HILL	Now how the hell can I help you?
KANSAS	Okay, you can't tell anybody.
MRS. HILL	Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
KANSAS	My best friend got pregnant.
MRS. HILL	Before you?  Whoo-hoo!

KANSAS	I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
MRS. HILL	Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
KANSAS	I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
MRS. HILL	So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!

MRS. HILL	Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
KANSAS	Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
MRS. HILL	What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
KANSAS	Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
MRS. HILL	Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.

LUCY	Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
KANSAS	More proof God's a guy...
LUCY	...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
KANSAS	Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.

KANSAS	I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
LUCY	Stop it!  This is crazy!

KANSAS	What the hell do you want?
LUCY	I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...

BRAD	Yeah? What do you want?
GUS	Buddy, are we in trouble.

BRAD	What?
GUS	First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?

BRAD	What are you talkin' about?
GUS	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
BRAD	Mr. Roebush?
GUS	Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
BRAD	Tuesday.
GUS	TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!

BRAD	S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
GUS	Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
BRAD	Not enough vodka in it.
GUS	There's no vodka in it.
BRAD	Aha! What'd I tell ya!
GUS	What? What did you tell me?

GUS	Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
BRAD	Brad.
GUS	Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
BRAD	Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
GUS	Brad?
BRAD	No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
GUS	Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!

GUS	Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
BRAD	Nope.  Never. 

BRAD	Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
CLARK	Brad Wilson.
BRAD	Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  "See" I mean,  Hahaha!

BRAD	Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
CLARK	I seem to be.

BRAD	All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
CLARK	Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
BRAD	A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.

CLARK	Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
BRAD	For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.

CLARK	I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
BRAD	The kid needs a man to show him --
CLARK	The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!

CLARK	Lana Lang. How great to see you.
LANA	Clark.

LANA	You look wonderful.
CLARK	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?

CLARK	You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
LANA	And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
CLARK	You're welcome...??
LANA	For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?

LANA	I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
CLARK	Sure, Lana, I'd love to.

LANA	You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
CLARK	The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --

LANA	And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
CLARK	It sure is.
LANA	There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.

LANA	You know what's the problem?
CLARK	Too much mayonnaise?
LANA	Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
CLARK	I didn't --
LANA	No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
CLARK	But Lana, you could --
LANA	That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
CLARK	Who?
LANA	Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.

LANA	You...um...you never got married?
CLARK	Oh...I came close once.

LANA	That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
CLARK	You thought that?
LANA	I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.

LANA	I just can't stand this.
CLARK	Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
LANA	It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
CLARK	But all he had was chocolate milk.
LANA	I mean him.

CLARK	Gee, I haven't done this in years.
LANA	Some people don't think it's healthy.
CLARK	Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
LANA	Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
CLARK	Me??
LANA	I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.

LANA	And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
CLARK	There's a lot of choices here.
LANA	No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
CLARK	I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!

LANA	Peanut butter and jelly.
CLARK	No, thanks.
LANA	No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
CLARK	Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
LANA	Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.

LANA	Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
CLARK	Me neither...

LANA	So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
CLARK	You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --

LANA	I can never get a way from it.
CLARK	Old ties are hard to cut.
LANA	No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 

LANA	That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
CLARK	Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
LANA	No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
CLARK	Call me.
LANA	Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.

LANA	The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
CLARK	Can I help?

LANA	He really was!
CLARK	Uh-huh.
LANA	Well, aren't you excited?
CLARK	Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.

CLARK	Gee, I always loved porch swings.
LANA	Me too. That's why I put this one up.

CLARK	No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
LANA	Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.

LANA	I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
CLARK	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
LANA	Anyday...

CLARK	Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
PERRY	Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.

CLARK	Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
PERRY	Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!

PERRY	I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
CLARK	Let me do it for you, Mr. White.

PERRY	-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
CLARK	Oh. You're going away.

CLARK	Uh...excuse me, folks...
PERRY	Kent!
CLARK	I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.

CLARK	Well...  Not quite like this.
RICKY	Mom and I do this all the time.

RICKY	Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
CLARK	What!

RICKY	Do you really know Superman?
CLARK	We get together sometimes.

RICKY	Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
CLARK	Sure.
RICKY	Could you get me Superman's autograph?

RICKY	Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
CLARK	Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.

CLARK	Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
LOIS	Say!
CLARK	Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --

CLARK	So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
LOIS	Exactly what I was about to ask about me.

CLARK	You're the best, Lois.
LOIS	I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
CLARK	Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
LOIS	Oh?

CLARK	It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
JIMMY	I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.

JIMMY	But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
CLARK	Mmmmm . . .
JIMMY	The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
CLARK	What's that?

JIMMY	Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
CLARK	At one o'clock in the morning?

JIMMY	Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
CLARK	What are you doing?
JIMMY	You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.

CLERK	Name?
GUS	Gus Gorman.

CLERK	Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
GUS	Yeah.
CLERK	What kind?
GUS	Kitchen. . . Technician
CLERK	Dishwasher? Any luck?
GUS	Nope, but --
CLERK	Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
GUS	Thirty-five.
CLERK	Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
GUS	They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
CLERK	A television set?
GUS	Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
CLERK	The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
GUS	Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
CLERK	Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
GUS	I know, I'm the fault.
CLERK	Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
GUS	Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
CLERK	You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
GUS	What about this week's check?

GUS	Sonofagun! Look at this here!
FRED	First paycheck?
GUS	First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
FRED	That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
GUS	I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.

FRED	Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
GUS	What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
FRED	They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
GUS	Who gets it, the company?
FRED	No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
GUS	So where is all them half-centses?
FRED	They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.

FRED	How many sugars?
GUS	One.  And a half.

FRED	Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
GUS	Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
FRED	Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
GUS	Yeah. A raise . .

FRED	Gus?
GUS	Say what?
FRED	The boss wants to see you.
GUS	Say who?

GUS	Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
ROSS	Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...

ROSS	You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
GUS	Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...

ROSS	Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
GUS	Uh...
ROSS	Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
GUS	Yeah? What do you do with 'em?

ROSS	I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
GUS	Or socks.
ROSS	Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
GUS	'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?

ROSS	Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
GUS	I'm tryin' to.

ROSS	Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
GUS	Black or regular?
ROSS	I don't think you understand.

GUS	Man, what is this?
ROSS	Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.

ROSS	Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
GUS	Decaffeinated too?

ROSS	But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
GUS	Which country?
ROSS	Columbia.
GUS	Columbia.
ROSS	Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 

GUS	Wipe 'em out?
ROSS	Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.

GUS	But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
ROSS	A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
GUS	Me? How?

ROSS	Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
GUS	That what they call you?

GUS	How do you do that?
ROSS	Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.

ROSS	Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
GUS	Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
ROSS	When?
GUS	First question got to be "Where."
ROSS	What?
GUS	Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.

GUS	Hey, boss.
ROSS	Just the man I wanted to see!
GUS	Turn on the T.V.
ROSS	I did. isn't it neat-o?
GUS	Uh...what channel were you watching?
ROSS	What are you talking about, fella?

GUS	It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
ROSS	Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.

GUS	Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
ROSS	God, that's what I keep you for.
GUS	That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
ROSS	Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
GUS	Greed!  Let me tell you something---

GUS	He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
ROSS	KRYPTONITE!
GUS	Huh?

ROSS	Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
GUS	They ain't got captains?
ROSS	Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.

ROSS	And do nothing. Just sit there.
GUS	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
ROSS	You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.

ROSS	And then shut down the pipe lines.
GUS	Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
ROSS	Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?

GUS	Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
ROSS	I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
GUS	The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.

GUS	Now...when do I get a taste?
ROSS	I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
GUS	Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.

ROSS	Is this blackmail?
GUS	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
ROSS	Is this whitemail?
GUS	Fair's fair.
ROSS	What do you want?

ROSS	A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
ROSS	For what?
GUS	A computer.
ROSS	We've already got some.
GUS	Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
ROSS	You designed it?
GUS	I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
ROSS	What will it do?
GUS	Everything.
ROSS	What will it get me?
GUS	Anything.
ROSS	Tell me more...

GUS	Yeah? How's it look?
ROSS	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
GUS	I told you it wasn't no jive.
ROSS	Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
GUS	Stone mutha.
ROSS	Exactly. Stoned mother.

ROSS	But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
GUS	Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
ROSS	Can you do that?
GUS	Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...

ROSS	Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
GUS	Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.

GUS	You want to mess with Superman?
ROSS	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.

GUS	Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
ROSS	Join the party, genius! Come on up!

SUPERMAN	How you doing down there?
GUS	Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
SUPERMAN	Hey, you're perfectly safe.
GUS	I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
SUPERMAN	That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
GUS	Watch out for them air pockets!
SUPERMAN	No, we're just going down.
GUS	We gonna crash?
SUPERMAN	I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
GUS	We back in Metropolis?
SUPERMAN	No...I just have a little stop to make.

GUS	Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
SUPERMAN	Just a second.

SUPERMAN	Thanks.  Let's go
GUS	I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
SUPERMAN	Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?

GUS	Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
VERA	Sister! I'm his sister!

GUS	Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
VERA	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
GUS	What she call you?

VERA	You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
GUS	And do what?

GUS	I know, by computers.
VERA	Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.

PERRY	Who is she?
JIMMY	Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.

PERRY	Who's the other woman?
JIMMY	That's his sister. Vera Webster.

PERRY	You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!
JIMMY	I didn't have my camera with me.
PERRY	A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --

PERRY	All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
JIMMY	What about me?
PERRY	What about you?
JIMMY	A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!

JIMMY	Why do I have to do this?
PERRY	You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
JIMMY	It was hot!

LANA	Ricky?  Where...what...
SUPERMAN	I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
LANA	Thank ...you.
SUPERMAN	Anytime.

LANA	Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
SUPERMAN	We've already met.
LANA	And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
SUPERMAN	I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.

SUPERMAN	You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
LANA	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.

LANA	He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
SUPERMAN	You just did, with that great dinner.

SUPERMAN	There's no rush.
LANA	But the bridge...
SUPERMAN	Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.

SUPERMAN	It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
LANA	Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
SUPERMAN	The bridge...?  I'd better get going!

PERRY	The picture looks blurry.
LOIS	The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.

LOIS	What terrific story?
PERRY	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
LOIS	Whoopee.

LOIS	Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
PERRY	Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.

PERRY	Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
LOIS	I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

LORELEI	I thought you'd never get here.
SUPERMAN	Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
LORELEI	Don't worry. I'm long past saving.

LORELEI	Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
SUPERMAN	I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?

LORELEI	Lots of things...
SUPERMAN	Tell me.

LORELEI	I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
SUPERMAN	Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
LORELEI	Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
SUPERMAN	No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
LORELEI	It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...

SUPERMAN	I don't know you, lady.
LORELEI	But the other night...
SUPERMAN	That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.

LORELEI	Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
VERA	Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!

VERA	If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
LORELEI	Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.

VERA	Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
LORELEI	Diet soda?
VERA	Energy! And when they say "Energy" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.

VERA	How would you know?
LORELEI	Hey, I know a lot of things!
VERA	So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.

VERA	At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining. ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace.
LORELEI	And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?

LORELEI	I can't see anything.
VERA	Turn on the light.
LORELEI	Where's the light switch?
VERA	Where do you usually find a light switch?

VERA	Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
LORELEI	Gus?
VERA	Superman. The boy you left behind.

VERA	You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
LORELEI	In other words, push this red button.

LORELEI	Oh, Superman!
VERA	Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
LORELEI	He can have mine. Anytime.

VERA	I can't! It's out of control!
LORELEI	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!

MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
PERRY	Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
MISS HENDERSON	Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.

PERRY	53.
MISS HENDERSON	53!

PERRY	Okay? Goodbye.
MISS HENDERSON	You've got to pick three more numbers.

MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, the next number, please?
PERRY	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
MISS HENDERSON	By hand. Like the pioneers did.
PERRY	Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?

MISS HENDERSON	Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
PERRY	Why do I have to do this?

MISS HENDERSON	It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
PERRY	Where's the handle?
MISS HENDERSON	There is no handle! You just push a button.

SIMPSON	85,000 dollars.
ROSS	Missing????
SIMPSON	Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.

SIMPSON	I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
ROSS	My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

ROSS	Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
SIMPSON	Hello.

ROSS	Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
SIMPSON	He's bound to slip up sooner or later.

VERA	That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
ROSS	Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.

VERA	I don't kiss.
ROSS	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.

ROSS	But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
VERA	It could make weather!
ROSS	Storms! Floods!
VERA	Blizzards! Heat waves!

ROSS	Computers talk to other computers, right?
VERA	Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.

VERA	She's not his mama either.
ROSS	Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.

VERA	Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
ROSS	Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...

ROSS	You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
VERA	Today coffee----
ROSS	TOMORROW THE OIL!

VERA	Small potatoes.
ROSS	We already have a super-tanker.
VERA	Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
ROSS	I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!

ROSS	He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
VERA	Don't cry, Bubba.

ROSS	Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
VERA	How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...

ROSS	Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
VERA	What's wrong?
ROSS	I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
VERA	Where did it come from?
ROSS	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.

VERA	So?
ROSS	So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--

ROSS	Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
VERA	A normal person.
ROSS	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
VERA	We can get to work on that oil!

ROSS	That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
VERA	Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?

VERA	Come on, let's give it a dry run.
ROSS	Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
VERA	Who needs Gus?

ROSS	He's the only one who can operate this --
VERA	Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!

ROSS	He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
VERA	Don't bet on it!

VERA	Yes! This time we got it right!
ROSS	It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.

CHARLIE	Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
TED	You and your pep talks.
CHARLIE	Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
TED	That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...

TED	I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
CHARLIE	That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.

TED	See? Did you see that?
CHARLIE	She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.

CHARLIE	The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
TED	Were you always this sick?
CHARLIE	One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.

TED	Someday, I'll find out.
CHARLIE	You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.

TED	I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
CHARLIE	That's crazy talk.
TED	I defy any and all limits.

CHARLIE	Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
TED	Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.

CHARLIE	Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
TED	Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
CHARLIE	Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
TED	Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
CHARLIE	Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
TED	Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
CHARLIE	And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...

CHARLIE	What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
TED	Astronomical.

CHARLIE	Who the hell was your father?
TED	Well, Dad said...

CHARLIE	...A bouncer? Are you serious?
TED	Maybe he got promoted.

CHARLIE	This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
TED	Cut it out, before you break something!
CHARLIE	For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.

CHARLIE	Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
TED	Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
CHARLIE	And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.

CHARLIE	I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
TED	Perv.

CHARLIE	This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
TED	Be cool. Fake it if you have to.

CHARLIE	I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
TED	This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
CHARLIE	Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
TED	Not ever. Never.

TED	You kiss your mother with that mouth?
CHARLIE	I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...

TED	So far away? In Xenia?
CHARLIE	Yeah, whatever.

CHARLIE	Check this out.  Hurry!
TED	I better go, Dad.

CHARLIE	Hurry.
TED	What is it now?
CHARLIE	Check it out!

TED	Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
CHARLIE	Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.

TED	I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
CHARLIE	Dead?
TED	Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
CHARLIE	Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
TED	And some really fast cars.

CHARLIE	Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
TED	It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
CHARLIE	I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.

TED	I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
CHARLIE	...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.

TED	Oh, how inappropriate is that!
CHARLIE	Take a whiff of heaven.
TED	How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
CHARLIE	I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
TED	Give me those!

CHARLIE	A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
TED	Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.

CHARLIE	You're late, bro!
TED	Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
CHARLIE	You'll never believe who's in there.
TED	It better not be my Aunt Trudy.

TED	I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
CHARLIE	With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.

TED	I thought I loved her.
CHARLIE	Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.

TED	Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
CHARLIE	No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
TED	And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
CHARLIE	I love those springy head puppies!

TED	Get them together.
CHARLIE	Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.

CHARLIE	Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
TED	We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
CHARLIE	Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.

CHARLIE	You got everything you ever wanted.
TED	Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.

CHARLIE	Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
UNCLE BILLY	This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.

UNCLE BILLY	Never say never.
CHARLIE	Oh, god.  Look. Look.

UNCLE BILLY	Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
CHARLIE	Let me get this straight...
UNCLE BILLY	If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
CHARLIE	These are real, live women?
UNCLE BILLY	We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
CHARLIE	God, I love being dead.

JULIE	What gives, Don Corleone?
CHARLIE	We reinvented ourselves.
JULIE	New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
CHARLIE	You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
JULIE	That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
CHARLIE	Jealousy is so unattractive.

JULIE	Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
CHARLIE	He kicked major ass and you know it.

CHRISTY	Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
TED	From your lips, to God's ears.
CHRISTY	You go first.
TED	Ladies first.  I insist.
CHRISTY	Well. The prom's coming up.
TED	Yeah?
CHRISTY	And I was wondering.
TED	Yeah?
CHRISTY	If you don't have...I mean...

CHRISTY	Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
TED	SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.

CHRISTY	Ted, have you lost your mind?
TED	You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
CHRISTY	I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
TED	But that smile.
CHRISTY	Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
TED	So you'll think about it?

CHRISTY	You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
TED	So that's a maybe?
CHRISTY	The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.

CHRISTY	Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
TED	Yeah? You like?
CHRISTY	Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.

CHRISTY	Hi, Teddy Bear.
TED	Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
CHRISTY	I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.

CHRISTY	I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
TED	I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
CHRISTY	I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
TED	Do it?
CHRISTY	You know...take the pictures?

TED	I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
CHRISTY	Which you pulled, hard!
TED	That was code for "I like you."

CHRISTY	Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
TED	I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
CHRISTY	Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.

CHRISTY	Well?
TED	You have changed since second grade.
CHRISTY	I mean, what do you think?
TED	You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
CHRISTY	Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.

CHRISTY	I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
TED	Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
CHRISTY	Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?

TED	God, you are so hot.
CHRISTY	Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.

MOM	We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
DAD	We own a small family grocery store.

MOM	We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
DAD	Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...

MOM	Sweetheart, what is it?
DAD	I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
MOM	Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.

DAD	Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
MOM	We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
DAD	We love our lives just the way they are.

MOM	You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
DAD	But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
MOM	Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?

MOM	We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
DAD	We miss you. We miss our son.
MOM	We miss our family.

DAD	We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
MOM	We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.

DAD	We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
TED	It's my private business! Mine!

DAD	I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
TED	Dad, please.
DAD	Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
TED	Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
DAD	You're way ahead of me again?
TED	It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
DAD	The lesson being?
TED	Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
DAD	I'm getting so good at this.

TED	You guys are my parents.
DAD	Of course we are.
TED	They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...

DAD	Son.
TED	Well, why should I?
DAD	They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
TED	I guess.
DAD	They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
TED	Yeah.
DAD	Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
TED	I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
DAD	Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
TED	Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
DAD	Whatever helps you cope.
TED	I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
DAD	There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
TED	...not the pit.

DAD	Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
TED	Just say it, Dad.
DAD	I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
TED	Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
DAD	Well, good. Every little bit helps.

TED	Finally, some gratitude.
DAD	We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.

DAD	But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
TED	Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.

DAD	Sorry I--
TED	It's okay. You need me?
DAD	Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.

TED	I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
DAD	You ordered a Winnebago?

TED	THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
DAD	Watch your tone, mister.
TED	Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.

TED	Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
DAD	I will not have my boys arguing.

TED	I-I don't have the keys.
GINGER	They're in the ignition, silly.

GINGER	You do know how to drive?
TED	I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
GINGER	Want a lesson?

GINGER	Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
TED	Got it.

GINGER	The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
TED	I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
GINGER	It's your car. These are all your cars.
TED	Some of them have to be automatics.
GINGER	Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."

TED	I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
GINGER	I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
TED	The one with the horses.
GINGER	That's me.
TED	I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.

GINGER	Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
TED	Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
GINGER	Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
TED	Hi ho, Silver.

GINGER	Who exactly ARE you?
TED	What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
GINGER	And who IS Ted Nelson?

GINGER	Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
TED	I always knew there was more. I felt it.
GINGER	Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.

GINGER	Teddy? I was thinking.
TED	Hmmm?
GINGER	After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
TED	Whatever you want.

GINGER	Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
TED	Of course we were.

GINGER	Ted! Do something!
TED	What do you want me to do?
GINGER	This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
TED	Hang in there, I'll think of something.

GINGER	Well?
TED	I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.

HEATHER	Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
TOM	But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
HEATHER	But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
TOM	If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?

HEATHER	But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
TOM	We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.

HEATHER	Can you believe that was me?
TOM	Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
HEATHER	So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
TOM	Everything.

TED	You're on the next plane home.
HELEN	I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.

TED	No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
HELEN	We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.

HELEN	It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
TED	Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.

HELEN	Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
TED	You mean they knew who I was?
HELEN	They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.

TED	I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
HELEN	Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
TED	My legacy.
HELEN	Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
TED	They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
HELEN	I understand.
TED	And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
HELEN	But how can you respect yourself if you don't?

JAY	How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
TED	Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
JAY	Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?

TED	I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
JAY	What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"

TED	Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
JAY	I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
TED	Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.

JIMMY	Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
TED	Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!

TED	James, what are you doing here?
JIMMY	You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
TED	Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
JIMMY	She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
TED	It's really late...do your parents know where you are?

JIMMY	Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
TED	Most places are, Jimmy.
JIMMY	They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
TED	So, what brings you here at his hour?
JIMMY	My new bike.
TED	Very funny.
JIMMY	I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
TED	My room?
JIMMY	Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
TED	It's not up to me.
JIMMY	Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
TED	You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.

JIMMY	If you could just sign right there.
TED	You want it in writing?
JIMMY	Just a formality.

TED	That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
JIMMY	Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
TED	Are they okay?
JIMMY	Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
TED	I miss them, too.
JIMMY	You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
TED	You're a peach.
JIMMY	Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.

TED	He was my Grandfather, too.
JIMMY	I meant biologically.
TED	That's a crappy thing to say.
JIMMY	Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

JIMMY	But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
TED	I didn't forget.
JIMMY	You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?

TED	Great.
JIMMY	From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.

JULIE	So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
TED	That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
JULIE	Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
TED	The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.

JULIE	Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
TED	Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.

JULIE	Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
TED	Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
JULIE	I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
TED	Me-ow.
JULIE	Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
TED	I have absolutely no intention--
JULIE	--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.

JULIE	I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
TED	But you triple-dog-dared me.
JULIE	It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.

JULIE	A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
TED	It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.

JULIE	What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
TED	Your article sucked.
JULIE	In what sense?
TED	In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
JULIE	Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
TED	Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
JULIE	Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
TED	I'm trying to help.
JULIE	I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
TED	That's not ENTIRELY true.

TED	What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
JULIE	Then I'll write about YOU.
TED	Me?
JULIE	Local boy inherits more money than god. Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
TED	Really? You wanna write about me?

TED	I have to admit, I always felt... different.
JULIE	Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
TED	I don't get the distinction.
JULIE	Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
TED	I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
JULIE	I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
TED	I guess.
JULIE	Interesting.

JULIE	She said peanuts, you cretin.
TED	You never know around here.

TED	Don't write that part.
JULIE	Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
TED	Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
JULIE	Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
TED	Funny you should say "peachy."
JULIE	I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
TED	My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
JULIE	Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.

TED	Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
JULIE	I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
TED	See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
JULIE	And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
TED	A little respect would be nice, that's all.

TED	Well? What do you think of her?
JULIE	You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
TED	You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?

TED	Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
JULIE	Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
TED	Why can't you be nice to me?
JULIE	You've got enough people kissing your ass.

TED	Wow...you clean up nice.
JULIE	Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.

TED	Where are we going?
JULIE	To the best hiding place in the world.

TED	I can't believe your dad built this for you.
JULIE	He didn't. He had it built.
TED	Whatever.
JULIE	Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
TED	He cared enough to want you to have it.
JULIE	He phoned it in.
TED	I see.
JULIE	I doubt it.
TED	Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
JULIE	The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
TED	You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
JULIE	Your dad taught you everything.
TED	I mean my father.
JULIE	A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
TED	It's all so complicated.
JULIE	It's incredibly simple.
TED	I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
JULIE	Eventually you'll let go.
TED	And then what?
JULIE	Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
TED	You're amazing.
JULIE	I know.
TED	Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
JULIE	But you never do.
TED	If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.

JULIE	Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
TED	In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
JULIE	That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
TED	There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
JULIE	You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
TED	He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!

JULIE	A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
TED	Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...

TED	That's probably my office.
JULIE	Well? Where the hell are you?
TED	He's on the move?
JULIE	I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
TED	Let's do it.

TED	I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
JULIE	You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
TED	At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
JULIE	Amen to that.

TED	Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
JULIE	I'm trembling with excitement.
TED	That has more to do with your proximity to me.
JULIE	My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
TED	I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
JULIE	I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
TED	Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
JULIE	Wearing them?  Or humping them?
TED	My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
JULIE	That's refreshingly deviant.
TED	What about you?
JULIE	I'm very aural.
TED	Tell me more.
JULIE	Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
TED	I see.
JULIE	I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
TED	A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
JULIE	You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
TED	Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
JULIE	You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.

TED	Do you trust me, Julie?
JULIE	Not a chance.
TED	Come on.
JULIE	Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.

TED	I want you to trust me.
JULIE	Maybe someday.
TED	Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
JULIE	That's hard to believe.
TED	But absolutely true.

JULIE	I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
TED	I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
JULIE	I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
TED	Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.

JULIE	You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
TED	You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
JULIE	Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
TED	You're quick. I like that.
JULIE	You think you're working with chimps here?
TED	The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
JULIE	Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.

TED	Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
JULIE	I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
TED	I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.

TED	And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
JULIE	Very ambitious. I like that.
TED	The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
JULIE	I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.

JULIE	Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
TED	I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.

JULIE	I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
TED	Yellow pages?
JULIE	Let your fingers do the walking.

TED	They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
JULIE	You better.

TED	What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
MOM	No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
TED	I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!

MOM	That's part of growing up, honey.
TED	What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?

MOM	What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
TED	Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?

TED	I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
MOM	Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
TED	Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
MOM	Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
TED	It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.

TED	Well? Surprised?
MOM	What is all this? When are you coming home?
TED	Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
MOM	Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
TED	Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.

MOM	Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
TED	Only the best for my mother.
MOM	You promise you'll finish school?
TED	I'll make you very proud.

TED	You don't have to work another day in your lives.
MOM	But how would we pay our bills?

TED	Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
MOM	Oh. Goodness.
TED	You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
MOM	Like what?
TED	Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.

MOM	But who would run the store?
TED	Forget the store. Think big.

TED	Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
MOM	Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.

TED	I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
MOM	Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN	I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
TED	Thanks, Principal Merkin.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
TED	Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
TED	You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
TED	Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	I never figured you for a pimp.
TED	Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
TED	I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?

TED	With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
TED	If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in "Heaven" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress.

TED	Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	Rules are rules.
TED	Come on, it's our only senior prom.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.

PRINCIPAL MERKIN	You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
TED	A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	I'm warning you.
TED	A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.

TED	You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
TED	What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
TED	You called the cops on us?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN	Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.

UNCLE BILLY	Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?
TED	Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
UNCLE BILLY	I have only one concern...

UNCLE BILLY	You do like girls, don't you?
TED	Of course I like girls.
UNCLE BILLY	A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
TED	As much as possible.
UNCLE BILLY	You're sure?

UNCLE BILLY	The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
TED	Seldom? No kidding?

TED	Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
UNCLE BILLY	Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.

UNCLE BILLY	Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.
TED	I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.

UNCLE BILLY	We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
TED	Tipping?

UNCLE BILLY	There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
TED	Yeah.  Everything's cool.

UNCLE BILLY	You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
TED	Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
UNCLE BILLY	They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.

TED	Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
UNCLE BILLY	YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
TED	All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
UNCLE BILLY	Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
TED	I do?
UNCLE BILLY	You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.

UNCLE BILLY	You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
TED	Me? The King of Coitus?
UNCLE BILLY	The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
TED	Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
UNCLE BILLY	Why, look who's here.

UNCLE BILLY	I told you you could do it.
TED	I was like a different person tonight.
UNCLE BILLY	You were the new and improved you.
TED	I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
UNCLE BILLY	No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
TED	It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
UNCLE BILLY	You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
TED	Really? You'd do that for me?
UNCLE BILLY	I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
TED	You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
UNCLE BILLY	I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
TED	My parents always say hard work builds character.
UNCLE BILLY	It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
TED	What kind of ideas?
UNCLE BILLY	Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
TED	You think we should be more open minded?
UNCLE BILLY	The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
TED	In other words, our scope is too narrow.
UNCLE BILLY	At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
TED	That's perfect.

UNCLE BILLY	Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
TED	I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.

UNCLE BILLY	So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
TED	Really? So I'm doing OK?

TED	My father must've been amazing.
UNCLE BILLY	He was in a league of his own.

TED	I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
UNCLE BILLY	I can't wait to see the pictures.
TED	It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.

UNCLE BILLY	Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
TED	Seriously? I'm doing all right?
UNCLE BILLY	You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.

TED	I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
UNCLE BILLY	I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
TED	Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.

TED	I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
UNCLE BILLY	You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
TED	Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
UNCLE BILLY	You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.

TED	Yes?
UNCLE BILLY	We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.

UNCLE BILLY	I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
TED	--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!

UNCLE BILLY	What are you doing?
TED	My job. Back off, Benedict.

TED	Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
UNCLE BILLY	All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
TED	That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
UNCLE BILLY	Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.

ZUKERMAN	In a hurry, are we?
TED	I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
ZUKERMAN	Bad news.
TED	People pay good money for that?
ZUKERMAN	I'm just a messenger.

TED	Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
ZUKERMAN	It's about your parents.

TED	My parents? What do you mean?
ZUKERMAN	I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
TED	You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
ZUKERMAN	Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.

ZUKERMAN	How quaint.
TED	It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.

ZUKERMAN	Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
TED	I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
ZUKERMAN	Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?

ARTEMUS	J. S. Bach.
JIM	Jim West.
ARTEMUS	Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
JIM	I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
ARTEMUS	Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
JIM	Funny.  So am I.
ARTEMUS	Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
JIM	Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
ARTEMUS	Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...

JIM	Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
ARTEMUS	Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.

JIM	You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
ARTEMUS	If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.

JIM	But don't pull that again.
ARTEMUS	Wouldn't dream of it.

ARTEMUS	Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
JIM	Put them all together and what do we have?
ARTEMUS	A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
JIM	Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
ARTEMUS	Ay, there's the rub.  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.

ARTEMUS	Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
JIM	Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
ARTEMUS	Gadget guy?  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.

ARTEMUS	Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
JIM	You need that real often?
ARTEMUS	Always hoping.  Or this...
JIM	No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
ARTEMUS	Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
JIM	All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
ARTEMUS	Try what?

JIM	Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
ARTEMUS	Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...

JIM	That should put us ahead of the criminals.
ARTEMUS	I'll work on it.

ARTEMUS	Aha!
JIM	Aha?
ARTEMUS	Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
JIM	Is this leading somewhere?
ARTEMUS	Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
JIM	Starting with a screw?
ARTEMUS	Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
JIM	What about the explosive?

ARTEMUS	Limestone quarry?
JIM	Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
ARTEMUS	Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.

ARTEMUS	Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
JIM	Prepare what?
ARTEMUS	My disguise.  And here...

ARTEMUS	Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
JIM	Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
ARTEMUS	Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.

JIM	That's a lot of butler.
ARTEMUS	Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
JIM	Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.

JIM	Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
ARTEMUS	Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
JIM	All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
ARTEMUS	Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?

ARTEMUS	You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
JIM	Almost?
ARTEMUS	Yes.  Now, observe....

JIM	You feeling all right?
ARTEMUS	Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.

ARTEMUS	Now, what was that?
JIM	You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
ARTEMUS	Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.

ARTEMUS	What was all that back there?
JIM	All what?
ARTEMUS	All that jumping and kicking.
JIM	That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.

ARTEMUS	Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
JIM	And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.

ARTEMUS	Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
JIM	I'm going to hit you.

JIM	Never seen a gun fire so fast!
ARTEMUS	It's a repeating steam cannon!

JIM	At least I tried something.
ARTEMUS	Hey, I tried the board.

ARTEMUS	Damn it, this is ridiculous.
JIM	At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
ARTEMUS	That's right... That's good.

ARTEMUS	Jim, are you all right?
JIM	No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
ARTEMUS	Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.

ARTEMUS	If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
JIM	What way is that?
ARTEMUS	So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
JIM	Spontaneous.  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
ARTEMUS	Well... that, too.
JIM	Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.

ARTEMUS	So... what happened?
JIM	Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
ARTEMUS	Uh... how long ago was this?
JIM	I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.

JIM	You might have mentioned you had that.
ARTEMUS	I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.

ARTEMUS	Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
JIM	I find most criminals slip up somewhere...

ARTEMUS	They're so precious when they're asleep.
JIM	You really enjoy yourself, don't you?

ARTEMUS	Can you fill me in here?
JIM	Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
ARTEMUS	Thank you.
JIM	Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
ARTEMUS	You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.

ARTEMUS	Know what this is?
JIM	Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
ARTEMUS	A cylinder recorder.  My own design.

JIM	This is good.
ARTEMUS	Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!

ARTEMUS	Oh, damn!  That's it.
JIM	It's better than nothing.
ARTEMUS	It is?
JIM	He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.

JIM	No record of him.
ARTEMUS	You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.

ARTEMUS	What's this?
JIM	Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
ARTEMUS	Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.

ARTEMUS	Willard...
JIM	It's not a guy...
ARTEMUS	It's a town!

ARTEMUS	Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
JIM	That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?

JIM	Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
ARTEMUS	Relax.  We're almost there.
JIM	We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!

JIM	What is that?
ARTEMUS	This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
JIM	And people are actually fooled by that?
ARTEMUS	My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.

JIM	Not again.
ARTEMUS	I adjusted it.

JIM	So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
ARTEMUS	You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?

JIM	When we find him, he is mine.
ARTEMUS	Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.

ARTEMUS	What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
JIM	Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...

ARTEMUS	Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
JIM	Oh, thank you.
ARTEMUS	My pleasure.

JIM	Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
ARTEMUS	What?  President Grant is...!
JIM	I know!  I know!
ARTEMUS	I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
JIM	We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
ARTEMUS	I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
JIM	There's only seventy-eight.
ARTEMUS	Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!

ARTEMUS	It was in your book.
JIM	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.

JIM	Are those just button buttons or...?
ARTEMUS	Of course not.

ARTEMUS	My hat is off to you, sir.
JIM	Thank you.

ARTEMUS	God in heaven, what is that?!
JIM	That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!

ARTEMUS	My God!  He's so excessive!
JIM	Where have you been?

JIM	Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
ARTEMUS	Oh, I see, an easy plan!

ARTEMUS	The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
JIM	He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
ARTEMUS	All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
JIM	In the next two minutes?

JIM	Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
ARTEMUS	What is this?  A whole new train?
JIM	Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?

JIM	Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
ARTEMUS	I'm sure we will.

ARTEMUS	Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
PEMBERTON	Yes, me!
ARTEMUS	You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.

ARTEMUS	You didn't tell us you had this on!
PEMBERTON	My Lord, he was telling the truth!

PEMBERTON	He calls it the Tarantula.
ARTEMUS	But it only has six legs.

PEMBERTON	He's not giving up?
ARTEMUS	Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...

ARTEMUS	Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
PEMBERTON	Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!

MIGUELITO	A new friend?
CASSANDRA	We'll see.

MIGUELITO	Anyone?
CASSANDRA	Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
MIGUELITO	Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...

MIGUELITO	I could get used to this, looking down on people.
CASSANDRA	They don't even realize they should be frightened.
MIGUELITO	Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.

JIM	My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
CASSANDRA	I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
JIM	You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
CASSANDRA	I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.

JIM	Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
CASSANDRA	Really?
JIM	Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
CASSANDRA	My... the wild west.

CASSANDRA	Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
JIM	Your guests, ma'am?
CASSANDRA	Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.

CASSANDRA	Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
JIM	Well, I owe you one, don't I?
CASSANDRA	You most certainly do.

CASSANDRA	You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
JIM	I don't like to lose, either.

CASSANDRA	Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
JIM	You tell me.
CASSANDRA	I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
JIM	Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
CASSANDRA	Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
JIM	I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.

JIM	Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
CASSANDRA	Would that include me?
JIM	Oh, I would hope not.

CASSANDRA	You've... done... this... before.
JIM	I've had some practice.

CASSANDRA	She's perfectly safe.
JIM	Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?

CASSANDRA	My.  It's gotten longer.
JIM	You bring the best out in a man.
CASSANDRA	I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.

JIM	You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
CASSANDRA	Fine, I'll stop.

JIM	Look, I'm Captain James West...
DOYLE	Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.

DOYLE	Your private train, sir.
JIM	Private train?
DOYLE	That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.

DOYLE	Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
JIM	My friend?

DOYLE	Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
JIM	I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?

GRANT	Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
RICHARDS	Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...

GRANT	Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
RICHARDS	Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
GRANT	French?
RICHARDS	Yes sir.
GRANT	French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!

RICHARDS	Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
GRANT	A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?

JIM	Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
GRANT	That'll be all, boys.

JIM	Good work.  Really.
GRANT	This is Colonel Richards.
JIM	Nice to finally meet you, sir.

JIM	But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
GRANT	Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.

GRANT	We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
JIM	Nicely said, sir.
GRANT	Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.

GRANT	Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
JIM	And?
GRANT	And now the job's yours.

JIM	... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
GRANT	On my way to Denver...

JIM	Where'd he say he was going to do this?
GRANT	He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.

JIM	I admire a man with a sense of humor.
MIGUELITO	When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?

JIM	I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
MIGUELITO	Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.

MIGUELITO	Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
JIM	No, sir... just a businessman.
MIGUELITO	Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
JIM	I deal with some tough customers.

MIGUELITO	Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
JIM	How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?

JIM	Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
MIGUELITO	Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?

MIGUELITO	... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
JIM	Dr. Loveless?

JIM	You're not that big.
MIGUELITO	Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.

MIGUELITO	Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
JIM	He had a pressing engagement.
MIGUELITO	Philistine.

JIM	You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
MIGUELITO	Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
JIM	Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?

JIM	The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
MIGUELITO	Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!

MIGUELITO	These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
JIM	That would be... the Mexican War?
MIGUELITO	Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!

MIGUELITO	I've even printed my own currency.
JIM	Emperor Miguelito...?
MIGUELITO	The first.
JIM	Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
MIGUELITO	Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
JIM	So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?

JIM	Easy now.
MIGUELITO	Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?

JIM	Dr. Pemberton?
PEMBERTON	Yes!

JIM	Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
PEMBERTON	Who were they?  What do they want with me?
JIM	We'll explain on the way.

PEMBERTON	I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
JIM	Who was this partner of his?
PEMBERTON	A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
JIM	A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.

JIM	Are you all right?
PEMBERTON	For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.

PEMBERTON	He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
JIM	He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.

JIM	This is something.
PEMBERTON	It's a smelting retort.

JIM	Now it's a bomb.
PEMBERTON	It is?

JIM	I beg your pardon?
PEMBERTON	You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.

JIM	Well?
WALTERS	They're coming.
JIM	When are they coming?
WALTERS	They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
JIM	In an hour they're gone!

WALTERS	Hey...!
JIM	You're not going to use it, are you?
WALTERS	Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
JIM	Right.
