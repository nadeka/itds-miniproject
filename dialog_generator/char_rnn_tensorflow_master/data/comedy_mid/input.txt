BIANCA	Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
CAMERON	Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
BIANCA	Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
CAMERON	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?

BIANCA	You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
CAMERON	Forget it.

BIANCA	No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
CAMERON	Cameron.
BIANCA	The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
CAMERON	Seems like she could get a date easy enough...

CAMERON	Why?
BIANCA	Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
CAMERON	That's a shame.

BIANCA	Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
CAMERON	Let me see what I can do.

BIANCA	C'esc ma tete. This is my head
CAMERON	Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
BIANCA	I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
CAMERON	That's because it's such a nice one.
BIANCA	Forget French.

BIANCA	How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
CAMERON	Well, there's someone I think might be --

CAMERON	There.
BIANCA	Where?

CAMERON	You got something on your mind?
BIANCA	I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?

CAMERON	You have my word.  As a gentleman
BIANCA	You're sweet.

CAMERON	How do you get your hair to look like that?
BIANCA	Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.

CAMERON	Sure have.
BIANCA	I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
CAMERON	I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.

CAMERON	She's not a...
BIANCA	Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
CAMERON	So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
BIANCA	Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.

BIANCA	Hi.
CAMERON	Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?

BIANCA	You know Chastity?
CAMERON	I believe we share an art instructor

CAMERON	Have fun tonight?
BIANCA	Tons

CAMERON	I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
BIANCA	I was?
CAMERON	You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?

BIANCA	Well, no...
CAMERON	Then that's all you had to say.
BIANCA	But
CAMERON	You always been this selfish?

BIANCA	Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
CAMERON	No...

BIANCA	do you listen to this crap?
CAMERON	What crap?
BIANCA	Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
CAMERON	Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...

CAMERON	I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
BIANCA	What good stuff?
CAMERON	The "real you".
BIANCA	Like my fear of wearing pastels?

BIANCA	I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
CAMERON	No
BIANCA	Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.

CAMERON	Wow
BIANCA	Let's go.

CAMERON	She okay?
BIANCA	I hope so.

CAMERON	They do to!
BIANCA	They do not!

BIANCA	Did you change your hair?
CHASTITY	No.
BIANCA	You might wanna think about it

BIANCA	Where did he go?  He was just here.
CHASTITY	Who?
BIANCA	Joey.

CHASTITY	Great
BIANCA	Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?

BIANCA	He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
CHASTITY	Is he oily or dry?
BIANCA	Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...

CHASTITY	Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
BIANCA	Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
CHASTITY	All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.

BIANCA	I have to be home in twenty minutes.
CHASTITY	I don't have to be home 'til two.

CHASTITY	You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
BIANCA	I did.

JOEY	It's more
BIANCA	Expensive?

JOEY	Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
BIANCA	Hopefully.

JOEY	So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
BIANCA	Queen Harry?
JOEY	It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.

BIANCA	Neat...
JOEY	My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.

JOEY	Hey, sweet cheeks.
BIANCA	Hi, Joey.
JOEY	You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.

JOEY	Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
BIANCA	You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --

KAT	Where've you been?
BIANCA	Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.

KAT	I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
BIANCA	Can you at least start wearing a bra?

BIANCA	Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
KAT	It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
BIANCA	Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
KAT	What do you think?
BIANCA	I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.

BIANCA	You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
KAT	What's normal?
BIANCA	Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.

BIANCA	Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
KAT	At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.

BIANCA	Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
KAT	It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
BIANCA	Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.

BIANCA	You are so completely unbalanced.
KAT	Can we go now?

KAT	Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
BIANCA	I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.

BIANCA	I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
KAT	You're welcome.

KAT	Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
BIANCA	Like you care.
KAT	I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
BIANCA	I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.

KAT	Joey never told you we went out, did he?
BIANCA	What?
KAT	In 9th.  For a month
BIANCA	Why?
KAT	He was, like, a total babe
BIANCA	But you hate Joey
KAT	Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
BIANCA	As in...

KAT	He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
BIANCA	You did what?
KAT	Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.

BIANCA	But
KAT	After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
BIANCA	Why didn't you tell me?
KAT	I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
BIANCA	No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.

KAT	That's not
BIANCA	I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
KAT	I guess I thought I was protecting you.
BIANCA	God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
KAT	Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
BIANCA	I guess I'll never know, will I?

BIANCA	You looked beautiful last night, you know.
KAT	So did you

BIANCA	Let go!
KAT	You set me up.
BIANCA	I just wanted --
KAT	What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
BIANCA	No! I just wanted

BIANCA	Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
KAT	It's just you.

BIANCA	Patrick -- is that- a.
KAT	Perm?

BIANCA	Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
WALTER	No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
BIANCA	What if she never starts dating?
WALTER	Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
BIANCA	But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!

BIANCA	But she doesn't want to date.
WALTER	Exactly my point

BIANCA	Daddy, I --
WALTER	And where're you going?
BIANCA	If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
WALTER	Otherwise known as an orgy?
BIANCA	It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --

BIANCA	Daddy, people expect me to be there!
WALTER	If Kat's not going, you're not going.

WALTER	Oh, God.  It's starting.
BIANCA	It's just a party. Daddy.

WALTER	Wear the belly before you go.
BIANCA	Daddy, no!
WALTER	Just for a minute

WALTER	Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
BIANCA	Why?
WALTER	Because she'll scare them away.

BIANCA	Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
WALTER	The prom?  Kat has a date?
BIANCA	No, but
WALTER	It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
BIANCA	He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
WALTER	You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
BIANCA	Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!

WALTER	I'm missing something.
BIANCA	I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.

PATRICK	Always a pleasure, Brucie.
BRUCE	Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
PATRICK	Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
BRUCE	Never
PATRICK	Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
BRUCE	Just sent 'em through.

MICHAEL	You the new guy?
CAMERON	So they tell me...
MICHAEL	C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.

MICHAEL	So -- which Dakota you from?
CAMERON	North, actually.  How'd you   ?
MICHAEL	I was kidding. People actually live there?
CAMERON	Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
MICHAEL	How many people were in your old school?
CAMERON	Thirty-two.
MICHAEL	Get out!
CAMERON	How many people go here?
MICHAEL	Couple thousand. Most of them evil

CAMERON	That I'm used to.
MICHAEL	Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.

CAMERON	That girl -- I --
MICHAEL	You burn, you pine, you perish?
CAMERON	Who is she?
MICHAEL	Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
CAMERON	Why not?
MICHAEL	I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.

CAMERON	Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
MICHAEL	Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
CAMERON	He always have that shit-eating grin?
MICHAEL	Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.

MICHAEL	You know French?
CAMERON	Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
MICHAEL	Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
CAMERON	You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
MICHAEL	You could consecrate with her, my friend.

MICHAEL	Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
CAMERON	That's her?  Bianca's sister?
MICHAEL	The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.

CAMERON	I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
MICHAEL	Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?

CAMERON	What about him?
MICHAEL	You wanna go out with him?

MICHAEL	What makes you think he'll do it?
CAMERON	He seems like he thrives on danger
MICHAEL	No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
CAMERON	They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
MICHAEL	I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
CAMERON	Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
MICHAEL	Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
CAMERON	That's what I just said

MICHAEL	You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
CAMERON	I thought you hated those people.
MICHAEL	Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.

CAMERON	You got him involved?
MICHAEL	Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.

CAMERON	This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
MICHAEL	In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
CAMERON	Will Bogey get bent?
MICHAEL	Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

CAMERON	Number one.  She hates smokers
MICHAEL	It's a lung cancer issue
CAMERON	Her favorite uncle
MICHAEL	Dead at forty-one.

MICHAEL	He's pretty!
CAMERON	Okay!  I wasn't sure

MICHAEL	Assail your ears for one night.
CAMERON	It's her favorite band.

MICHAEL	You told me that part already.
CAMERON	Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -

MICHAEL	Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
CAMERON	The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
MICHAEL	Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
CAMERON	No, I ' m not.

CAMERON	You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
MICHAEL	Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.

CAMERON	And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
PATRICK	Yeah -- we'll see.

PATRICK	What've you got for me?
CAMERON	I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.

CAMERON	Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
PATRICK	So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?

CAMERON	Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
PATRICK	Don't make me do it, man

PATRICK	Cameron, I'm a little busy
CAMERON	It's off. The whole thing.

PATRICK	What 're you talking about?
CAMERON	She's partial to Joey, not me

PATRICK	Cameron -- do you like the girl?
CAMERON	Sure
PATRICK	Then, go get her

CAMERON	What'd you do to her?
PATRICK	I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.

CAMERON	She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
PATRICK	She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.

PATRICK	You makin' any headway?
CAMERON	She kissed me.
PATRICK	Where?

PATRICK	What's the worst?
CAMERON	You get the girl.

JOEY	The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
KAT	Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
JOEY	They're running the rest of me next month.

KAT	Hey -- do you mind?
JOEY	Not at all

JOEY	Where ya goin?
KAT	Away.
JOEY	Your sister here?

KAT	Leave my sister alone.
JOEY	And why would I do that?

PATRICK	Yeah
JOEY	What do you think?

PATRICK	Two legs, nice rack...
JOEY	Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
PATRICK	Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
JOEY	You just said
PATRICK	You need money to take a girl out
JOEY	But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?

JOEY	You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
PATRICK	You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
JOEY	I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
PATRICK	How much?

PATRICK	I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
JOEY	Fine, thirty.

JOEY	Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
PATRICK	Fifty, and you've got your man.

JOEY	When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
PATRICK	I'm on it
JOEY	Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
PATRICK	I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.

PATRICK	I just upped my price
JOEY	What?
PATRICK	A hundred bucks a date.
JOEY	Forget it.
PATRICK	Forget her sister, then.

PATRICK	It's about time.
JOEY	A deal's a deal.

JOEY	How'd you do it?
PATRICK	Do what?
JOEY	Get her to act like a human

PATRICK	I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
JOEY	Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.

MICHAEL	Hey.
JOEY	Are you lost?
MICHAEL	Nope - just came by to chat
JOEY	We don't chat.
MICHAEL	Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
JOEY	We're not.

MICHAEL	But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
JOEY	Does this conversation have a purpose?
MICHAEL	So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.

JOEY	I hear you're helpin' Verona.
MICHAEL	Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
JOEY	You and Verona?
MICHAEL	What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.

JOEY	You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
MICHAEL	Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?

MANDELLA	Who's that?
KAT	Patrick Verona   Random skid.
MANDELLA	That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
KAT	I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
MANDELLA	He always look so
KAT	Block E?

KAT	Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
MANDELLA	Just a little.

KAT	What's this?
MANDELLA	An attempted slit.

KAT	I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
MANDELLA	But imagine the things he'd say during sex.

KAT	The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
MANDELLA	You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.

KAT	So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
MANDELLA	William would never have gone to a state school.
KAT	William didn't even go to high school
MANDELLA	That's never been proven
KAT	Neither has his heterosexuality.

KAT	I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
MANDELLA	Does it matter?
KAT	If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."

MANDELLA	You think this'll work?
KAT	No fear.

MANDELLA	What'd he say?
KAT	Who cares?

MANDELLA	You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
KAT	I didn't have a choice.
MANDELLA	You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
KAT	I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
MANDELLA	You didn't
KAT	I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.

KAT	Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
MANDELLA	Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
KAT	Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
MANDELLA	Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
KAT	You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
MANDELLA	Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.

MANDELLA	Have you seen him?
KAT	Who?
MANDELLA	William - he asked me to meet him here.
KAT	Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.

PATRICK	I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
KAT	Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
PATRICK	There's a way to get a guy's attention.
KAT	My mission in life.

PATRICK	Pick you up Friday, then
KAT	Oh, right.  Friday.

PATRICK	The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
KAT	Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
PATRICK	I know a lot more than that

PATRICK	You hate me don't you?
KAT	I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
PATRICK	Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
KAT	And why would I do that?
PATRICK	Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
KAT	You -- covered in my vomit.
PATRICK	Seven-thirty?

KAT	Are you following me?
PATRICK	I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
KAT	Hi

PATRICK	You're not a big talker, are you?
KAT	Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

PATRICK	hey.  Great show, huh?

PATRICK	Excuse me?
KAT	That's what you want, isn't it?
PATRICK	Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.

PATRICK	You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
KAT	You know who The Raincoats are?
PATRICK	Why, don't you?

PATRICK	What's this?
KAT	I'm getting trashed, man. Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
PATRICK	I say, do what you wanna do.
KAT	Funny, you're the only one

PATRICK	Okay?
KAT	I'm fine. I'm

PATRICK	You're not okay.
KAT	I just need to lie down for awhile
PATRICK	Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
KAT	I know, just let me sleep
PATRICK	What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...

KAT	This is so patronizing.
PATRICK	Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
KAT	Why 're you doing this?
PATRICK	I told you
KAT	You don't care if I die
PATRICK	Sure, I do
KAT	Why?
PATRICK	Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
KAT	Like you could find one
PATRICK	See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
KAT	Just let me sit down.

PATRICK	Why'd you let him get to you?
KAT	Who?
PATRICK	Dorsey.
KAT	I hate him.
PATRICK	I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
KAT	Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
PATRICK	I thought you were above all that
KAT	You know what they say

PATRICK	Kat! Wake up!
KAT	What?

PATRICK	And I'm in control of it.
KAT	But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.

KAT	When you were gone last year -- where were you?
PATRICK	Busy
KAT	Were you in jail?
PATRICK	Maybe.
KAT	No, you weren't
PATRICK	Then why'd you ask?
KAT	Why'd you lie?

KAT	I should do this.
PATRICK	Do what?
KAT	This.

PATRICK	Start a band?
KAT	My father wouldn't approve of that that
PATRICK	You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.

KAT	Oh, so now you think you know me?
PATRICK	I'm gettin' there

PATRICK	So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
KAT	He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
PATRICK	Who?
KAT	BIANCA
PATRICK	No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...

PATRICK	Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
KAT	What are you doing here?
PATRICK	I heard there was a poetry reading.
KAT	You 're so --
PATRICK	Pleasant?

PATRICK	Wholesome.
KAT	Unwelcome.
PATRICK	Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
KAT	Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
PATRICK	So what did I have an effect on ?
KAT	Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.

KAT	He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
PATRICK	Look up, sunshine

PATRICK	I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
KAT	C'mon.  It's not that bad
PATRICK	Try lookin' at it from this angle

KAT	Put your right foot there --
PATRICK	Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
KAT	You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
PATRICK	Maybe.

KAT	The Partridge Family?
PATRICK	I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
KAT	Good call.
PATRICK	So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
KAT	I dazzled him with my wit

PATRICK	A soft side? Who knew?
KAT	Yeah, well, don't let it get out
PATRICK	So what's your excuse?
KAT	Acting the way we do.
PATRICK	Yes
KAT	I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
PATRICK	So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
KAT	Something like that
PATRICK	Then you screwed up
KAT	How?
PATRICK	You never disappointed me.

PATRICK	You up for it?
KAT	For. . . ?

KAT	State trooper?
PATRICK	Fallacy.
KAT	The duck?
PATRICK	Hearsay.
KAT	I know the porn career's a lie.

KAT	Tell me something true.
PATRICK	I hate peas.
KAT	No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
PATRICK	You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
KAT	What?
PATRICK	No one else knows
KAT	You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
PATRICK	Go to the prom with me

KAT	Is that a request or a command?
PATRICK	You know what I mean
KAT	No.
PATRICK	No what?
KAT	No, I won't go with you
PATRICK	Why not?
KAT	Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.

KAT	Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
PATRICK	So I have to have a motive to be with you?
KAT	You tell me.
PATRICK	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
KAT	Answer the question, Patrick
PATRICK	Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.

KAT	How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
PATRICK	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
KAT	It's just something I had.  You know
PATRICK	Oh huh
KAT	Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.

PATRICK	My grandmother's .
KAT	What?
PATRICK	That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.

KAT	That ' s completely adorable!
PATRICK	It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?

PATRICK	Wait I...
KAT	You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
PATRICK	It wasn't like that.
KAT	Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
PATRICK	I didn't care about the money.

KAT	A Fender Strat. You bought this?
PATRICK	I thought you could use it. When you start your band.

PATRICK	Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
KAT	Is that right?
PATRICK	Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.

KAT	Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
PATRICK	Because I like to torture you.
KAT	Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
PATRICK	Don ' t you even dare. . .

KAT	I know.
WALTER	I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
KAT	You decided.

KAT	This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
WALTER	Enough!

WALTER	My insurance does not cover PMS
KAT	Then tell them I had a seizure.
WALTER	Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
KAT	I thought you were punishing me.
WALTER	Why can't we agree on this?
KAT	Because you're making decisions for me.
WALTER	As a parent, that's my right
KAT	So what I want doesn't matter?
WALTER	You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
KAT	I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --

WALTER	Was that your sister?
KAT	Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
WALTER	Funny.

WALTER	I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
KAT	No, Daddy.
WALTER	So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
KAT	Parts of it.
WALTER	Which parts?
KAT	The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
WALTER	Bianca did what?
KAT	What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
WALTER	No -- impressed.

WALTER	You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
KAT	When I go?
WALTER	Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.

MISS PERKY	Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
KAT	Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
MISS PERKY	Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
KAT	I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
MISS PERKY	The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...

KAT	Tempestuous?
MISS PERKY	No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.

KAT	Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
MISS PERKY	Just smack her now.

MICHAEL	Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
MANDELLA	Hi.
MICHAEL	Cool pictures.  You a fan?
MANDELLA	Yeah.  I guess.

MANDELLA	You think?
MICHAEL	Oh yeah.

MICHAEL	Macbeth, right?
MANDELLA	Right.
MICHAEL	Kat a fan, too?
MANDELLA	Yeah...

PATRICK	Say it
MICHAEL	What?
PATRICK	Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.

PATRICK	What plan?
MICHAEL	The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
PATRICK	What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?

MICHAEL	I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
PATRICK	Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.

MICHAEL	That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
PATRICK	So Dorsey can get the girl?
MICHAEL	Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.

PATRICK	You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
MICHAEL	We're your guys.

PATRICK	What?!
MICHAEL	Good enough.

PATRICK	Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
MICHAEL	Just for now.

MICHAEL	Ever been to Club Skunk?
PATRICK	Yeah.

MICHAEL	I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
PATRICK	I'm likin' you guys better

MICHAEL	So you got cozy with she who stings?
PATRICK	No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.

PATRICK	You were right. She's still pissed.
MICHAEL	Sweet love, renew thy force!
PATRICK	Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.

PATRICK	I missed you.
MISS PERKY	It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
PATRICK	It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
MISS PERKY	With the teeth of your zipper?

MISS PERKY	I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
PATRICK	Touch of the flu.
MISS PERKY	I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?

MISS PERKY	Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
PATRICK	What's to discuss?
MISS PERKY	You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
PATRICK	Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...

MISS PERKY	You're completely demented.
PATRICK	See you next week!

SHARON	In the microwave.
WALTER	Make anyone cry today?

SHARON	What's a synonym for throbbing?
WALTER	Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.

WALTER	Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
SHARON	Tumescent!
WALTER	You're not helping.

SHARON	Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
WALTER	Pirate -- no question.

SHARON	They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
WALTER	Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.

WALTER	What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
SHARON	Dr. Ruth?

SHARON	Have a great time, honey!
WALTER	But -- who -- what --?

WALTER	What just happened?
SHARON	Your daughters went to the prom.
WALTER	Did I have anything to say about it?
SHARON	Absolutely not.
WALTER	That ' s what I thought

ATTENDANT	Yeah?
LUTHER	I want to pick up my car.

ATTENDANT	Name?
LUTHER	Hammond.

ATTENDANT	This is three years old.
LUTHER	Yeah, I've been busy.

ATTENDANT	We don't wash 'em, ya know.
LUTHER	How about chargin' the battery?
ATTENDANT	That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
LUTHER	Great, just great.

BARTENDER	Yeah.
HAMMOND	Vodka.
BARTENDER	Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
HAMMOND	No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.

HAMMOND	Now how's your memory doin'?
BARTENDER	Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
HAMMOND	Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
BARTENDER	I don't give a shit who you ask.

HAMMOND	I don't give a damn about his girl...
BARTENDER	Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.

BARTENDER	I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
HAMMOND	Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...

GANZ	Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
BILLY	You got a real big mouth, convict.

GANZ	I want to drive awhile.
BILLY	I ain't tired yet.
GANZ	Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
BILLY	Whaddya mean, buy?
GANZ	Pros.

BILLY	Pay money?
GANZ	Yeah, dummy.  Money.
BILLY	I never paid for it in my life.
GANZ	It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
BILLY	They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
GANZ	Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?

GANZ	Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
BILLY	He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.

BILLY	Hey, what about me?
GANZ	And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.

CANDY	I'm candy...
HAMMOND	Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
CANDY	Hey, what kind of talk is that?
HAMMOND	Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
CANDY	No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
HAMMOND	Goodbye.

CANDY	Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
HAMMOND	Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.

CANDY	You're in a hurry.
HAMMOND	Yeah, i been waiting three years.
CANDY	You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
HAMMOND	No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
CANDY	What's the matter with my place?
HAMMOND	No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...

CANDY	Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
HAMMOND	Here's hoping, baby...

CANDY	Hello, again.
HAMMOND	I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.

HAMMOND	Here you go, baby.
CANDY	Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
HAMMOND	Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...

HAMMOND	I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
CANDY	Now you're talkin'. See ya...

CATES	I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
CASEY	Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.

CATES	How about it?
CASEY	I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...

CATES	I hear you've got visitors.
CASEY	Would you guys...
CATES	No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.

CATES	You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
CASEY	Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
CATES	You're gonna help us take him.
CASEY	No chance.
CATES	He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.

CATES	Where's ganz?
CASEY	In the back.  Down the other corridor.

CATES	You lying son of a bitch...
GANZ	What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...

GANZ	After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
CATES	I don't think you're gonna make it.
GANZ	Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...

GANZ	I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
CATES	You're done.  End of story.
GANZ	I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.

HAMMOND	You got a name, cop?
CATES	Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
HAMMOND	Sure, anything you want.

HAMMOND	You here to write my life story?
CATES	Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.

CATES	Yeah, I noticed...
HAMMOND	Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
CATES	Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.

CATES	Yeah?
HAMMOND	I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
CATES	You're crazy.
HAMMOND	I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
CATES	What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
HAMMOND	I got a lot to protect.
CATES	Bullshit.
HAMMOND	It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
CATES	I'll think about it.

CATES	This prison gives out $400 suits?
HAMMOND	What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.

CATES	We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
HAMMOND	Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...

CATES	I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
HAMMOND	You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.

HAMMOND	Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
CATES	You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
HAMMOND	No way to start a partnership.
CATES	Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
HAMMOND	Shit.  I'm already sorry.

CATES	Yeah.
HAMMOND	It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.

CATES	Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
HAMMOND	Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
CATES	Luther was part of the gang?
HAMMOND	What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
CATES	I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
HAMMOND	Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.

CATES	I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
HAMMOND	Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
CATES	I may call you worse than that.

HAMMOND	Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
CATES	Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
HAMMOND	Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
CATES	I'm helpin' you, huh?

HAMMOND	Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
CATES	I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
HAMMOND	I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
CATES	Just throw me the Goddamn gun.

CATES	Hey, this works pretty good.
HAMMOND	Thank you.
CATES	Want to try it again?

CATES	What do you think?
HAMMOND	I think you better put him on ice, man.
CATES	He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
HAMMOND	If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?

CATES	We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
HAMMOND	Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
CATES	Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
HAMMOND	Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
CATES	We eat when I say we eat.
HAMMOND	Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
CATES	Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
HAMMOND	Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.

HAMMOND	Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
CATES	Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.

HAMMOND	You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
CATES	She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?

CATES	Now, where we goin', convict?
HAMMOND	Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.

CATES	I don't give out the details.
HAMMOND	Last night, two nights ago, three?

CATES	Last night.
HAMMOND	You have a good time?

CATES	Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
HAMMOND	At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?

CATES	Well?
HAMMOND	It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
CATES	This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
HAMMOND	Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
CATES	If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
HAMMOND	But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
CATES	Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...

HAMMOND	I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
CATES	You need five years training to handle a joint like...

HAMMOND	Hey, you wanna bet?
CATES	I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
HAMMOND	If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
CATES	Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
HAMMOND	That's never been one of my problems.

CATES	I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
HAMMOND	What are you talkin' about?
CATES	You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
HAMMOND	I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
CATES	The bet's off.

CATES	I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
HAMMOND	I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.

HAMMOND	This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
CATES	My kind of place. I always liked country boys.

HAMMOND	That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
CATES	Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.

HAMMOND	You made that move, huh?
CATES	While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.

CATES	There.
HAMMOND	Must be billy's girl.
CATES	Come on.

CATES	Let's go.
HAMMOND	Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...

CATES	This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
HAMMOND	You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
CATES	You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
HAMMOND	I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
CATES	Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...

HAMMOND	Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
CATES	Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...

CATES	Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
HAMMOND	Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
CATES	They saved your ass, convict.
HAMMOND	One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.

HAMMOND	I been waiting a long time for some money.
CATES	How much?
HAMMOND	Half a million.
CATES	Jesus.

CATES	Just tell me about the money.
HAMMOND	Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
CATES	He's after your money.
HAMMOND	You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?

HAMMOND	We split 50-50?
CATES	Not likely, convict.
HAMMOND	You gonna let me keep any of it?
CATES	Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.

CATES	Where's the money?
HAMMOND	In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?

CATES	Right, partner.
HAMMOND	Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
CATES	Yeah.  Right.

CATES	Where's the goddamn car?
HAMMOND	You're a real case, you know that, Jack?

HAMMOND	This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
CATES	...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
HAMMOND	You just drove by it.

CATES	You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
HAMMOND	I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
CATES	Shit.

CATES	You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
HAMMOND	Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
CATES	Guess what?  Luther just got in line.

HAMMOND	What?
CATES	Musta got some primo bondsman.
HAMMOND	Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.

HAMMOND	Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
CATES	Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
HAMMOND	I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.

CATES	You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
HAMMOND	Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
CATES	If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
HAMMOND	I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
CATES	Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?

CATES	I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
HAMMOND	I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
CATES	That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.

HAMMOND	Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
CATES	If they don't tell me what I need to know...
HAMMOND	Doesn't it get... Tiring?
CATES	I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
HAMMOND	You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...

CATES	Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
HAMMOND	If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.

HAMMOND	A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
CATES	Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...

HAMMOND	You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
CATES	What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
HAMMOND	No class...
CATES	Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.

HAMMOND	We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
CATES	Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?

HAMMOND	That was in style a couple years back, man.
CATES	Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.

HAMMOND	Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
CATES	You stay with me...
HAMMOND	No way...

HAMMOND	Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
CATES	I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?

CATES	Where's luther?
HAMMOND	Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
CATES	Hello. And goodbye.

CATES	What about Luther?
HAMMOND	What about Ganz?

CATES	We missed.
HAMMOND	You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
CATES	Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
HAMMOND	Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.

HAMMOND	They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
CATES	So you took the rest of the night off...

CATES	Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
HAMMOND	Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...

CATES	I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
HAMMOND	You sure that's the reason?

CATES	Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
HAMMOND	Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
CATES	Yeah. Guess not.

CATES	Yeah, I see her.
HAMMOND	I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.

CATES	That was quick.
HAMMOND	When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
CATES	Why?
HAMMOND	Luther's on the move...

HAMMOND	Notice something funny about that bus?
CATES	Yeah. It missed the last four stops.

HAMMOND	Hey, how'd my car get here?
CATES	I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
HAMMOND	Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
CATES	I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.

HAMMOND	Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
CATES	Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
HAMMOND	Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.

HAMMOND	It's late, they're closing...
CATES	Don't worry about it.

CATES	Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
HAMMOND	Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...

HAMMOND	Do I get to kiss her too?
CATES	If she's right, and if you don't screw up.

HAMMOND	What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
CATES	I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.

HAMMOND	Hey, there she is...
CATES	Whatever play I maker just back me up.
HAMMOND	If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
CATES	Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
HAMMOND	Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
CATES	Partnership?
HAMMOND	Well, you got to admit we come a long way.

CATES	You okay?
HAMMOND	Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
CATES	You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...

CATES	Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
HAMMOND	Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.

HAMMOND	Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
CATES	There's nothin' to talk about.

CATES	It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
HAMMOND	And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
CATES	That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
HAMMOND	You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
CATES	No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
HAMMOND	Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.

CATES	Thanks.
HAMMOND	No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?

CATES	I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
HADEN	Yeah, I read the report...

CATES	Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
HADEN	Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.

CATES	Yeah...
HADEN	Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
CATES	Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
HADEN	You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
CATES	Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
HADEN	Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
CATES	You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
HADEN	Jack?
CATES	Yeah?
HADEN	Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
CATES	I'll keep it in mind.

HADEN	What the bell happened?
CATES	I lost them, that's what happened.
HADEN	How did they get away?
CATES	They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.

HADEN	Which one pulled the trigger?
CATES	The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
HADEN	You couldn't get to him?

HADEN	What a screw-up.
CATES	Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.

HADEN	Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
CATES	I didn't have the time.
HADEN	Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.

CATES	He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
HADEN	Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.

HADEN	Where the Christ do you think you're going?
CATES	I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.

YOUNG COP	That's what you say, Cates...
CATES	Yeah.
YOUNG COP	But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
CATES	The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

YOUNG COP	Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
CATES	Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
YOUNG COP	I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...

CATES	Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
KEHOE	Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
CATES	I'll help you out.

KEHOE	This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
CATES	Shit.

CATES	Billy Bear...
KEHOE	Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.

CATES	Who are all these?
KEHOE	They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
CATES	Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
KEHOE	Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.

CATES	Tell me that's not the same guy.
KEHOE	Hey ... Dick Tracy.

CATES	I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
KEHOE	Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
CATES	One of  em's in the slam.

KEHOE	You look awful.
CATES	So do you...been a long day.
KEHOE	Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
CATES	Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
KEHOE	Doesn't look like it.
CATES	Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
KEHOE	Nothing.

CATES	Bullshit red tape.
KEHOE	I'm heading out. How about you?

CATES	I got to wait for a call.
KEHOE	Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...

KEHOE	I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
CATES	What?

CATES	Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
KEHOE	I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.

LUTHER	A cop...
CATES	I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
LUTHER	Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
CATES	You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
LUTHER	Who gives a fuck what you think?

LUTHER	Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
CATES	I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
LUTHER	I don't know.

LUTHER	He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
CATES	When? How?
LUTHER	I dunno ... he's gonna call me...

ELAINE	What am I wanted for?
CATES	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...

ELAINE	I don't think your gun's loaded...
CATES	This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
ELAINE	I still don't think it's loaded.

CATES	Hey, you're right.
ELAINE	You're hopeless.
CATES	That's the way I see it, too.

ELAINE	I'm all wet.
CATES	What's wrong with that?

ELAINE	A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
CATES	What'd you do?
ELAINE	Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
CATES	I guess he got the message...
ELAINE	Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
CATES	Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
ELAINE	Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
CATES	I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
ELAINE	If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
CATES	Hey, you know what I really think?
ELAINE	Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
CATES	I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.

ELAINE	You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
CATES	What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?

CATES	Maybe you ought to buy me one.
ELAINE	Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.

ELAINE	That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
CATES	Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
ELAINE	Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
CATES	Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

ELAINE	When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
CATES	What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
ELAINE	I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.

ELAINE	You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
CATES	That's the way I see it, too.
ELAINE	Call me later.
CATES	You sure you want me to?
ELAINE	Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...

CATES	Thanks for the coffee.
ELAINE	I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
CATES	Guess people ought to know who I am...

ELAINE	Great place for lunch.
CATES	Yeah, one of my favorites.
ELAINE	You made the front page.

CATES	Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
ELAINE	Jack, are you okay?
CATES	Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...

ELAINE	Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
CATES	Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
ELAINE	Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
CATES	I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
ELAINE	Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
CATES	That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
ELAINE	I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.

ELAINE	Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
CATES	Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.

CATES	Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
ELAINE	This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.

ELAINE	I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
CATES	Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
ELAINE	No wonder you're so popular.
CATES	No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
ELAINE	So am I.

CATES	The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
ELAINE	Jack?  What was that?

CATES	Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
ELAINE	Jack, wait...
CATES	Just a second, that's all!

ELAINE	Hello.
CATES	Hi, it's me...
ELAINE	Fuck you.

ELAINE	Hey, I don't believe it.
CATES	Hiya, kid.
ELAINE	I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
CATES	Don't.  We've had a hard night.
ELAINE	I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
CATES	We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...

ELAINE	You real down?
CATES	I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.

CATES	Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
ELAINE	Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
CATES	How do you know?
ELAINE	Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...

ELAINE	What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
CATES	Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
ELAINE	It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
CATES	So what?
ELAINE	When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
CATES	Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
ELAINE	Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.

CATES	Whaddya think?
ELAINE	What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
CATES	Let's go, Reggie.

ELAINE	How'd they take it back at headquarters?
CATES	Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
ELAINE	I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
CATES	Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.

CATES	Three more hours...
ELAINE	Where is he?
CATES	Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
ELAINE	Tell me.
CATES	He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.

ELAINE	You're impossible...
CATES	That's what I always say.

ELAINE	Who the hell are you?
HAMMOND	Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.

ELAINE	I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
HAMMOND	Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
ELAINE	Shrink major, not a shrink.

HAMMOND	Hard man to live with.
ELAINE	How would you know?
HAMMOND	Hey, two days with him is enough.
ELAINE	That's no bull.

HAMMOND	He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
ELAINE	In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?

LISA	Hey...
GANZ	Shut up.
LISA	What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.

LISA	What do you want?  What's goin' on?
GANZ	Shut up.

GANZ	Stall.
LISA	What do you want?

GANZ	Keep stallin'.
LISA	Alright, I'm coming...hold on.

GANZ	How hot are they?
HENRY	Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.

GANZ	How ya doin'?
HENRY	Can't complain.
GANZ	We got a lot to talk about.
HENRY	Yeah, old times.
GANZ	We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
HENRY	Sure, right.

GANZ	Surprise, Luther.
LUTHER	Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
GANZ	I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
LUTHER	I don't know what you're talkin' about.
GANZ	You want that Indian to snap her neck?

GANZ	Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
LUTHER	Don't give me this, we were partners.
GANZ	Billy, go ahead, break it...
LUTHER	No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
GANZ	When?
LUTHER	I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
GANZ	You chickenshit punk...
LUTHER	Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...

LUTHER	Come on, you can trust me. Please.
GANZ	You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.

LUTHER	Let her go.
GANZ	First, the money.

LUTHER	Rosalie, you okay?
GANZ	What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.

HAMMOND	How you doing, man?
SOSNA	Not bad, not bad.

SOSNA	You want to go outside?
HAMMOND	Naw, right here's okay.

SOSNA	You sure?
HAMMOND	I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.

HAMMOND	How about some ammo?
SOSNA	It's loaded... I got some shells in here.

HAMMOND	How much?
SOSNA	This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
HAMMOND	Don't mess with me. How much?
SOSNA	Five bills.
HAMMOND	Five.  On credit.
SOSNA	This ain't a credit business.

HAMMOND	Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
SOSNA	Give it back.
HAMMOND	Try and take it.

SOSNA	Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
HAMMOND	I'll got your money to you. No sweat.

AUSTIN	You seem surprised to see me.
ALOTTA	I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
AUSTIN	What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
ALOTTA	What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
AUSTIN	Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
ALOTTA	You may.
AUSTIN	Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
ALOTTA	Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
AUSTIN	I didn't, baby, you just told me.
ALOTTA	It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
AUSTIN	Behave!

ALOTTA	Come in.
AUSTIN	I'd rather talk about Number Two.
ALOTTA	Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.

ALOTTA	May I wash you?
AUSTIN	Groovy.

ALOTTA	In Japan, men come first and women come second.
AUSTIN	Or sometimes not at all.
ALOTTA	Care for some saki?
AUSTIN	Sak-i it to me!

ALOTTA	How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
AUSTIN	Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.

AUSTIN	'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
ALOTTA	That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
AUSTIN	'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
ALOTTA	Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
AUSTIN	To my health.
ALOTTA	Kiss me.

ALOTTA	Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
AUSTIN	Is it about my teeth?
ALOTTA	Yes.
AUSTIN	Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
ALOTTA	I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
AUSTIN	I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
ALOTTA	Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.

ANDY WARHOL	Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
AUSTIN	Hey, how are you?
ANDY WARHOL	Hungry.
AUSTIN	Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.

ANDY WARHOL	I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
AUSTIN	If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
ANDY WARHOL	Fifteen minutes of fame? I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
AUSTIN	Smashing!

BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
AUSTIN	We know all that, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
AUSTIN	Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
BASIL EXPOSITION	I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.

AUSTIN	Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Good luck, Austin.
AUSTIN	Thank you.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
AUSTIN	Thank you.  Let's go, baby!

AUSTIN	Where am I?
BASIL EXPOSITION	You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
AUSTIN	WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
BASIL EXPOSITION	The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
AUSTIN	Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
BASIL EXPOSITION	You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
AUSTIN	Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
BASIL EXPOSITION	A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
AUSTIN	Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
BASIL EXPOSITION	We won, Austin.
AUSTIN	Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!

AUSTIN	When do I begin?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
AUSTIN	You mean Mrs. Kensington?
BASIL EXPOSITION	No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Vanessa's one of our top agents.
AUSTIN	My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
AUSTIN	Thanks.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
AUSTIN	Right away, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Where is Vanessa, by the way?

AUSTIN	She's working on another lead right now.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
AUSTIN	Thank you, Basil.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
AUSTIN	Oh, yes. Thank you.
BASIL EXPOSITION	There's one more thing, Austin.
AUSTIN	Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
AUSTIN	Thank you.

AUSTIN	Hello, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
AUSTIN	Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
BASIL EXPOSITION	What's the other?
AUSTIN	Excuse me?
BASIL EXPOSITION	What's the other thing you're scared of?
AUSTIN	Carnies.
BASIL EXPOSITION	What?
AUSTIN	Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
AUSTIN	Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.

BASIL EXPOSITION	My God, Austin, what have you done?
AUSTIN	That's not your mother, that's a man!

AUSTIN	I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
AUSTIN	You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.

BASIL EXPOSITION	All right, Austin, I think you should go.
AUSTIN	I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
BASIL EXPOSITION	I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
AUSTIN	Yes, Basil?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful.
AUSTIN	Thanks.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
AUSTIN	I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION	Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.

AUSTIN	Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
BASIL EXPOSITION	Austin, I have something for you as well.

BASIL EXPOSITION	Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
AUSTIN	Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.

BASIL EXPOSITION	But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
AUSTIN	Yes Basil?
BASIL EXPOSITION	Be careful!

MICK JAGGER	Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
AUSTIN	Hey, Mick!
MICK JAGGER	Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
AUSTIN	Well, you can't always get what you want.
MICK JAGGER	You can't always get what you want! That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
AUSTIN	Good on ya, man.
MICK JAGGER	Groovy!

DESTRUCTACON	Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
AUSTIN	Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
DESTRUCTACON	Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
AUSTIN	Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
DESTRUCTACON	That does not compute.
AUSTIN	Why not? It's a question.
DESTRUCTACON	Love is... love is... love is...

AUSTIN	What's wrong with your hand?
DR. EVIL	Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

AUSTIN	I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
DR. EVIL	Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.

AUSTIN	Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
DR. EVIL	No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.

AUSTIN	I've got you, Dr. Evil!
DR. EVIL	Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
AUSTIN	No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
DR. EVIL	Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
AUSTIN	That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
DR. EVIL	Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.

AUSTIN	It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
DR. EVIL	Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
AUSTIN	Man, you are one chilly square!

VANESSA	Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
AUSTIN	Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
VANESSA	My mother's told me all about you.
AUSTIN	If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
VANESSA	My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.

AUSTIN	OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
VANESSA	Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
AUSTIN	My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.

AUSTIN	Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
VANESSA	I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
AUSTIN	That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
VANESSA	I beg your pardon?
AUSTIN	I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
VANESSA	Excuse me?
AUSTIN	My wedding tackle.
VANESSA	I'm sorry?
AUSTIN	My meat and two veg.
VANESSA	Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
AUSTIN	Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
VANESSA	A Chigro?
AUSTIN	You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
VANESSA	We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
AUSTIN	That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!

AUSTIN	Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
VANESSA	Sure.
AUSTIN	Do I make you horny?
VANESSA	What?
AUSTIN	Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
VANESSA	I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
AUSTIN	Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
VANESSA	I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.

AUSTIN	You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
VANESSA	Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.

AUSTIN	Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
VANESSA	No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
AUSTIN	Why? What's wrong with my teeth?

AUSTIN	Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
VANESSA	I'm sure.
AUSTIN	I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.

AUSTIN	I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
VANESSA	Here, use mine.
AUSTIN	I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.

AUSTIN	I can't see a bloody thing.
VANESSA	Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.

VANESSA	Why did you leave so soon?
AUSTIN	That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.

AUSTIN	Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
VANESSA	Do you want to talk to him?

AUSTIN	Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
VANESSA	Why?
AUSTIN	We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.

VANESSA	A limousine has just pulled up.
AUSTIN	Let me see.

AUSTIN	Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
VANESSA	How do you know?
AUSTIN	I never forget a pussy... cat.

VANESSA	Let's go get him!
AUSTIN	He's too well-protected right now.
VANESSA	We can't just sit here, Austin.
AUSTIN	Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
VANESSA	I don't get it.
AUSTIN	Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
VANESSA	Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
AUSTIN	No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

VANESSA	I hate having my picture taken.
AUSTIN	You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.

AUSTIN	Fancy a nibble?
VANESSA	I couldn't have another bite.

VANESSA	Watch out, you're on my hair!
AUSTIN	Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
VANESSA	Go! Just go!

VANESSA	I haven't had fun like that since college.
AUSTIN	I'm sorry.
VANESSA	Why?
AUSTIN	I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.

VANESSA	Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
AUSTIN	No, this is me in a nutshell.

AUSTIN	You're smashed, Vanessa.
VANESSA	I am not.
AUSTIN	Oh, yes you are.
VANESSA	I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.

AUSTIN	I can't. You're drunk.
VANESSA	It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
AUSTIN	She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.

VANESSA	Really, Austin!
AUSTIN	Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.

VANESSA	Austin, may I have a word with you?
AUSTIN	Of course, luv.
VANESSA	Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
AUSTIN	Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
VANESSA	I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
AUSTIN	Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
VANESSA	No, did you use a condom?
AUSTIN	Only sailors use condoms, man.
VANESSA	Not in the Nineties.
AUSTIN	Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
VANESSA	Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
AUSTIN	It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
VANESSA	You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.

AUSTIN	Hello, luv.
VANESSA	Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
AUSTIN	Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
VANESSA	Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
AUSTIN	Out and about, doing odds and sods.
VANESSA	I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.

AUSTIN	Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
VANESSA	Do you think she's prettier than I?
AUSTIN	Who?
VANESSA	You know who.
AUSTIN	No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
VANESSA	I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.

VANESSA	Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
AUSTIN	Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.

VANESSA	Thank God, Austin, we made it.
AUSTIN	Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.

AUSTIN	Does that make you horny?
VANESSA	Not now, Austin.

AUSTIN	First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
VANESSA	Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.

AUSTIN	All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
VANESSA	No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
AUSTIN	Smashing idea! Give it to me.

AUSTIN	Not a good time to lose one's head.
VANESSA	Indeed.
AUSTIN	That's not the way to get ahead in life.
VANESSA	Yes.
AUSTIN	It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
VANESSA	Shut up.
AUSTIN	Fair enough.

VANESSA	What do we do now?
AUSTIN	We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
VANESSA	I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
AUSTIN	Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
VANESSA	I'll hurry back.
AUSTIN	Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
VANESSA	Austin, what's your point?
AUSTIN	Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
VANESSA	Oh, behave!

AUSTIN	It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
VANESSA	Likewise.
AUSTIN	I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
VANESSA	I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
AUSTIN	Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.

AUSTIN	Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
VANESSA	Are you crazy?
AUSTIN	Don't worry!

VANESSA	Austin, I'm coming with you.
AUSTIN	I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
VANESSA	I'll secure the perimeter.

VANESSA	I have something to tell you.
AUSTIN	Lay it on me.
VANESSA	I love you, Austin.
AUSTIN	That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
VANESSA	Kiss me.
AUSTIN	Behave!

CLERK	Danger Powers, personal effects.
AUSTIN	Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
CLERK	It says here, name Danger Powers.
AUSTIN	Danger's my middle name.
CLERK	OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
AUSTIN	That's not mine.
CLERK	One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
AUSTIN	I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
CLERK	One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
AUSTIN	I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
CLERK	One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.

GUARD	Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
AUSTIN	Sure.

AUSTIN	Everything seems to be in order.
GUARD	Hey, wait a minute--

AUSTIN	Here, have a piece of gum.
GUARD	Here, have a piece of gum.

AUSTIN	Don't mind if I do.
GUARD	Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.

AUSTIN	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
GUARD	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
AUSTIN	I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.

GUARD	Noooooooooooooo!
AUSTIN	Where did you learn to shoot?

RADAR OPERATOR	Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
COMMANDER GILMOUR	Is it one of ours?
RADAR OPERATOR	No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
COMMANDER GILMOUR	What are you saying, son?
RADAR OPERATOR	It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.

COMMANDER GILMOUR	Oh my God, he's back.
RADAR OPERATOR	In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
COMMANDER GILMOUR	Shut up.
RADAR OPERATOR	Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
COMMANDER GILMOUR	What's its current position?

RADAR OPERATOR	Commander, I have to log it...
COMMANDER GILMOUR	That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!

MUSTAFA	But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
DR. EVIL	Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!

MUSTAFA	But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
DR. EVIL	And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!

MUSTAFA	We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
DR. EVIL	Silence!

MUSTAFA	Ahhhhhhhhh!
DR. EVIL	Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.

DR. EVIL	We've got a lot of work to do.
MUSTAFA	Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
DR. EVIL	Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
MUSTAFA	Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
DR. EVIL	You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.

MUSTAFA	Ow! You shot me!
DR. EVIL	Right. Okay. Moving on.
MUSTAFA	You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--

FRAU FARBISSINA	Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
DR. EVIL	Yes.
FRAU FARBISSINA	Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
DR. EVIL	My son?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Yes.  Scott!

DR. EVIL	Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!

DR. EVIL	Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
FRAU FARBISSINA	These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!

DR. EVIL	Quite impressive.
FRAU FARBISSINA	Thank you, Herr Doctor.
DR. EVIL	I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.

DR. EVIL	Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
FRAU FARBISSINA	Dr. Evil?
DR. EVIL	Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
FRAU FARBISSINA	It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
DR. EVIL	Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.

DR. EVIL	What is it now?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
DR. EVIL	I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Sea bass.
DR. EVIL	Right.
FRAU FARBISSINA	They're mutated sea bass.
DR. EVIL	Really? Are they ill-tempered?
FRAU FARBISSINA	Please allow me to demonstrate.

THERAPIST	That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
DR. EVIL	Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

DR. EVIL	No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
THERAPIST	Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.

DR. EVIL	Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
THERAPIST	We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
DR. EVIL	The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
THERAPIST	That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.

SCOTT EVIL	Hi.
DR. EVIL	Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
SCOTT EVIL	I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!

DR. EVIL	But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
SCOTT EVIL	Not me.

DR. EVIL	An evil vet?
SCOTT EVIL	No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
DR. EVIL	An evil petting zoo?
SCOTT EVIL	You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.

DR. EVIL	Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
SCOTT EVIL	Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
DR. EVIL	Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
SCOTT EVIL	Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
DR. EVIL	And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
SCOTT EVIL	Yeah. What?

DR. EVIL	Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
SCOTT EVIL	Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
DR. EVIL	In due time.
SCOTT EVIL	But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
DR. EVIL	I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
SCOTT EVIL	Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
DR. EVIL	One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.

DR. EVIL	Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
SCOTT EVIL	Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
DR. EVIL	No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
SCOTT EVIL	I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
DR. EVIL	No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?

DR. EVIL	Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
SCOTT EVIL	I don't want to.
DR. EVIL	Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
SCOTT EVIL	Blow me.
DR. EVIL	What did you say?
SCOTT EVIL	Show me.

SCOTT EVIL	Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
DR. EVIL	I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
SCOTT EVIL	I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
DR. EVIL	Scott, don't say that...

NUMBER TWO	We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
DR. EVIL	Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.

NUMBER TWO	Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
DR. EVIL	People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.

NUMBER TWO	Umm, that also has already happened.
DR. EVIL	Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

NUMBER TWO	Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
DR. EVIL	All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

NUMBER TWO	Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
DR. EVIL	Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?

MRS. KENSINGTON	Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
VANESSA	Great.
MRS. KENSINGTON	How's Austin?
VANESSA	He's asleep.
MRS. KENSINGTON	You didn't...
VANESSA	Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.

MRS. KENSINGTON	I'm proud of you.
VANESSA	Why?
MRS. KENSINGTON	Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.

VANESSA	Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
MRS. KENSINGTON	You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
VANESSA	What about his teeth?
MRS. KENSINGTON	You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
VANESSA	I just don't see it.
MRS. KENSINGTON	Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
VANESSA	Did you ever...
MRS. KENSINGTON	Of course not. I was married to your father.
VANESSA	Did you ever want to?
MRS. KENSINGTON	Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.

VANESSA	You didn't answer my question, Mum.
MRS. KENSINGTON	I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.

MRS. KENSINGTON	No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
VANESSA	I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
MRS. KENSINGTON	I love you, Vanessa.

THERAPIST	So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
SCOTT EVIL	Well, it's kind of weird.
THERAPIST	We don't judge here.
SCOTT EVIL	OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
THERAPIST	And how do you feel about that?
SCOTT EVIL	I don't wanna take over the family business.

THERAPIST	What do you want to do, Scott?
SCOTT EVIL	I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.

THERAPIST	We don't label people here, Scott.
SCOTT EVIL	No, he's really evil.
THERAPIST	Scott.

SCOTT EVIL	I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
THERAPIST	OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.

1/16TH BLACK	Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
BIG BLACK	How 'bout...

1/16TH BLACK	BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
BIG BLACK	B-L-A-K it is.

1/16TH BLACK	Yo Black, you looking for trouble.

HONEYCUTT	Everybody say Ho!
AUDIENCE	Ho!
HONEYCUTT	That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.

HONEYCUTT	My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
AUDIENCE	Yeah!
HONEYCUTT	I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.

HONEYCUTT	C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?

AUDIENCE	Let's go NIGGERS.

AUDIENCE	Let's go niggers!
HONEYCUTT	Louder.  They can't hear you.

SLOAN	You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
BIG BLACK	I didn't mean to scare you like that.
SLOAN	Well you did.
BIG BLACK	Give me some?
SLOAN	I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
BIG BLACK	Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
SLOAN	I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
BIG BLACK	BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.

BIG BLACK	Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
SLOAN	I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?

BIG BLACK	My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
SLOAN	Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
BIG BLACK	So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
SLOAN	Who are you revolting against?
BIG BLACK	We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
SLOAN	Please.
BIG BLACK	If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
SLOAN	Delacroix.
BIG BLACK	Yeah, him.
SLOAN	What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
BIG BLACK	C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.

SLOAN	You don't have the demographics.
BIG BLACK	So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
SLOAN	That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
BIG BLACK	There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
SLOAN	If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
BIG BLACK	My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
SLOAN	That's mighty black of you.

BIG BLACK	The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
DELACROIX	What's your name?
BIG BLACK	My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
DELACROIX	And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
BIG BLACK	We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.

DELACROIX	We're ready when you are.
BIG BLACK	Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.

TAVIS SMILEY	Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
BIG BLACK	Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.

TAVIS SMILEY	And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
BIG BLACK	What do I do?
TAVIS SMILEY	What do you do?
BIG BLACK	I'm a revolutionary.

BIG BLACK	And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
TAVIS SMILEY	Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.

CHEEBA	Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
MANTAN	You might be right.
CHEEBA	Why are you smiling so?

MANTAN	I'm not smiling.
CHEEBA	Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
MANTAN	It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
CHEEBA	No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
MANTAN	Certified ladies' man, huh?
CHEEBA	She's also moorish.

MANTAN	What's that?
CHEEBA	Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
MANTAN	Seconds and thirds, too.
CHEEBA	Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
MANTAN	You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
CHEEBA	Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.

CHEEBA	DeLa - what's the matter with you.
MANTAN	You ain't happy about the green light?

CHEEBA	What's wrong with him?
MANTAN	Must be the pressure.

CHEEBA	Please, have a seat.
MANTAN	Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
CHEEBA	In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.

MANTAN	Why they gotta make my nose so big?
CHEEBA	Look at my lips.

CHEEBA	I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
MANTAN	What are you talkin' about?
CHEEBA	Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
MANTAN	Meaning?
CHEEBA	I'm out.
MANTAN	Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
CHEEBA	So that's what you been doing?
MANTAN	Damn skippy.
CHEEBA	You're in this up till ya neck.
MANTAN	Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
CHEEBA	You can walk away.  We both can.
MANTAN	Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
CHEEBA	I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.

DELACROIX	Good morning, Cheeba.
CHEEBA	Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
DELACROIX	De-la-croix.
CHEEBA	Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?

DELACROIX	Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
CHEEBA	You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
DELACROIX	No offense.
CHEEBA	Manray needs a job.

DELACROIX	I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
CHEEBA	How much?
DELACROIX	First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.

CHEEBA	What kind of show is this gonna be?
DELACROIX	Different.

CHEEBA	What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
DELACROIX	You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.

CHEEBA	Nice to meet you.
DELACROIX	And this is Manray.

DELACROIX	Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
CHEEBA	We might need some mo' money behind this.
DELACROIX	That can be done.

MANRAY	I'm starvin' like Marvin.
CHEEBA	My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
MANRAY	Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
CHEEBA	Did we get our bill yet?

CHEEBA	Ahh, the luxuries of life.
MANRAY	Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
CHEEBA	Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
MANRAY	And I'm the feet.
CHEEBA	Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
MANRAY	I'm tired of waiting.

MANRAY	We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
CHEEBA	Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?

MANRAY	We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
CHEEBA	We was coming to see you.
MANRAY	If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
CHEEBA	We're starving.

CHEEBA	That ain't funny.
MANRAY	DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.

DELACROIX	Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
MANRAY	Well do something about it.

MANRAY	My tap shoes.
DELACROIX	EUREKA!!

MANRAY	What do I have to do?
DELACROIX	Some tap dancing, some singing.
MANRAY	Where do I sign?

MANRAY	How different?
DELACROIX	Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
MANRAY	DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
DELACROIX	That's right.  Money turns the wheel.

DELACROIX	I would like to change your name.
MANRAY	To what?
DELACROIX	You're now Mantan.
MANRAY	Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.

DELACROIX	I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
MANRAY	Why?
DELACROIX	You have to start getting into your character.

MANRAY	Mantan?
DELACROIX	Mantan!!

MANRAY	I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
DELACROIX	How you sound?
MANRAY	I won't do it anymore.
DELACROIX	Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
MANRAY	I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
DELACROIX	No costume.  No blackface.

GARY BYRD	Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
DELACROIX	Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
GARY BYRD	No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
DELACROIX	Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
GARY BYRD	But the line has to be drawn.
DELACROIX	Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
GARY BYRD	Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
DELACROIX	Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 

DUNWITTY	...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
DUNWITTY	I'm sorry I'm late.
DUNWITTY	Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
DELACROIX	I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...

DELACROIX	Four minutes ago.
DUNWITTY	So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
DELACROIX	I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.

DUNWITTY	Do you know what C.P. Time is?
DELACROIX	C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.

DUNWITTY	I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
DELACROIX	I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
DUNWITTY	Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.

DUNWITTY	I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
DELACROIX	I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
DUNWITTY	NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.

DUNWITTY	The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
DELACROIX	I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
DUNWITTY	I'm telling you it's not.

DUNWITTY	The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
DELACROIX	...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.

DUNWITTY	Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
DELACROIX	I've never been given a fair shot.
DUNWITTY	You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
DELACROIX	I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
DUNWITTY	That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
DELACROIX	I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
DUNWITTY	You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.

DELACROIX	What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
DUNWITTY	Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.

DUNWITTY	Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
DELACROIX	It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.

DELACROIX	We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
DUNWITTY	I'm wid it.
DELACROIX	I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
DUNWITTY	Go on.  Good so far.
DELACROIX	I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?

DUNWITTY	Word!!!
DELACROIX	So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
DUNWITTY	The name of the show?
DELACROIX	It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
DUNWITTY	I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.

DUNWITTY	I'm feelin' dis'!
DELACROIX	It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
DUNWITTY	Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
DELACROIX	I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
DUNWITTY	Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?

DUNWITTY	That's a great handle.
DELACROIX	Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
DUNWITTY	I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.

DELACROIX	Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
DUNWITTY	What are there character traits?
DELACROIX	Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
DUNWITTY	Exactly!
DELACROIX	Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
DUNWITTY	And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
DELACROIX	Yep, you guessed it.
DUNWITTY	This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."

DELACROIX	Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
DUNWITTY	Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.

DELACROIX	Negroes would be in an uproar.
DUNWITTY	So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
DELACROIX	Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
DUNWITTY	Who are the other characters?
DELACROIX	Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.

DUNWITTY	We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
DELACROIX	In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
DUNWITTY	Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 

DUNWITTY	And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
DELACROIX	I don't know about that plantation angle.
DUNWITTY	What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?

DUNWITTY	That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
DELACROIX	We think so.
DUNWITTY	Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?

DELACROIX	I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
DUNWITTY	To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.

DELACROIX	I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
DUNWITTY	I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
DELACROIX	You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
DUNWITTY	I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
DELACROIX	Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
DUNWITTY	Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
DELACROIX	What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
DUNWITTY	If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
DELACROIX	That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
DUNWITTY	No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.

DELACROIX	In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
DUNWITTY	Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.

DUNWITTY	I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
DELACROIX	Dunwitty, don't leave.

DELACROIX	I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
DUNWITTY	Calm down, please.

DELACROIX	I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
DUNWITTY	We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
DELACROIX	Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
DUNWITTY	I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.

DUNWITTY	Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
DUNWITTY	They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
DELACROIX	This has to be a big mistake.
DUNWITTY	The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
DELACROIX	Hold on a sec, I got a call.
DELACROIX	Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
DELACROIX	I gots to go, it's my Moms.
DUNWITTY	I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.

JUNEBUG	What do you want?
DELACROIX	I want to speak with you.
JUNEBUG	Go away, unless you got my money.
DELACROIX	It's me, Peerless.

JUNEBUG	Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
DELACROIX	It's been a long time.
JUNEBUG	Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
DELACROIX	Pleased to meet you.

JUNEBUG	Good woman.  I trained her right.
DELACROIX	Daddy, she's younger than me.
JUNEBUG	My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.

JUNEBUG	Purely for medicinal purposes.
DELACROIX	I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.

JUNEBUG	I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
DELACROIX	How did you end up here?
JUNEBUG	How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?

DELACROIX	That's what I'm askin'.
JUNEBUG	Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
DELACROIX	Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.

JUNEBUG	That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
DELACROIX	Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
JUNEBUG	All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.

JUNEBUG	Enough about me, what's happening with you?
DELACROIX	The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.

JUNEBUG	Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
DELACROIX	Nuthin' I can't handle.
JUNEBUG	The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
DELACROIX	Where do you go from here?
JUNEBUG	Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
DELACROIX	I didn't mean that, in life.
JUNEBUG	In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?

DELACROIX	Let's get him over to the bed.
JUNEBUG	Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.

DELACROIX	I love you too, Daddy.
JUNEBUG	Always keep 'em laughing.

DOT	Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
DELACROIX	Is that so?

DELACROIX	How long has my father been like this?
DOT	Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
DELACROIX	So he drank himself into a stuper?
DOT	The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
DELACROIX	So what's up with you?
DOT	I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.

DELACROIX	Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
DOT	Your father is proud of you.

DELACROIX	He never showed it.
DOT	He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.

SLOAN	How was it?
DELACROIX	Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
SLOAN	Nobody told me anything.
DELACROIX	What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
SLOAN	It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.

DELACROIX	Manray!
SLOAN	Manray!

DELACROIX	How did you know?
SLOAN	It hit me like a ton of bricks.
DELACROIX	How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
SLOAN	The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?

DELACROIX	Manray was under our nose the whole time.
SLOAN	Do you know how you will use him?
DELACROIX	Not yet, but this thing will never get made.

SLOAN	You lost me.
DELACROIX	Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
SLOAN	What point is that?
DELACROIX	The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
SLOAN	Sounds risky to me.
DELACROIX	You getting cold feet?
SLOAN	I'm in till the end.
DELACROIX	Good.  I'm going to need your support.
SLOAN	Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
DELACROIX	And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.

SLOAN	Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
DELACROIX	Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.

SLOAN	Hello.
DELACROIX	This is Cheeba.

SLOAN	You okay?
DELACROIX	I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.

SLOAN	What is your problem?
DELACROIX	My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
SLOAN	Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
DELACROIX	It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
SLOAN	Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?

DELACROIX	Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
SLOAN	What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
DELACROIX	I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
SLOAN	Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.

DELACROIX	Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
SLOAN	Hello.
DELACROIX	I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired. 

SLOAN	This is the group I was telling you about.
DELACROIX	Which one is your brother?
SLOAN	The big one.

SLOAN	You've said that already.
DELACROIX	I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.

DELACROIX	Just want to say good luck.
SLOAN	Break a leg.

DELACROIX	Your life will never be the same.
SLOAN	Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
SLOAN	We both lied to him.
DELACROIX	What do you want me to say?
SLOAN	Just don't lie to me.

DELACROIX	Same here.
SLOAN	The pleasure is mine.

SLOAN	I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
DELACROIX	C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.

DELACROIX	Who's side are you on?
SLOAN	I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.

DELACROIX	What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
SLOAN	Everybody shut up.

SLOAN	So you have your small victory, now what?
DELACROIX	A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.

DELACROIX	What is this?
SLOAN	A gift.
DELACROIX	For what?
SLOAN	No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.

DELACROIX	The Jolly Nigger Bank.
SLOAN	This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
DELACROIX	Thanks.
SLOAN	I thought it was appropiate.
DELACROIX	Is that good or bad?
SLOAN	It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
DELACROIX	How so?
SLOAN	To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.

DELACROIX	Why'd you do that?
SLOAN	I don't want to hear it.
DELACROIX	How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
SLOAN	You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
DELACROIX	That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
SLOAN	He's just playing big brother.
DELACROIX	Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
SLOAN	Please don't go there.
DELACROIX	Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
SLOAN	I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
DELACROIX	Do you have to be so damn forthright?

SLOAN	DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
DELACROIX	Light?
SLOAN	That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
DELACROIX	You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.

DELACROIX	This is crazy.
SLOAN	That's why it will be so much fun.

SLOAN	That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
DELACROIX	The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
SLOAN	Work related or otherwise?

DELACROIX	Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
SLOAN	DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
DELACROIX	And that's how you got me in the first place.

SLOAN	Don't make me have to use this.
DELACROIX	I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.

SLOAN	I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
DELACROIX	Give me the gun.

DELACROIX	Yes, your name?
MONA	He, I'm Mona.
DELACROIX	Hi, Mona.
MONA	I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
DELACROIX	Oh, is that what I'm doing?

DELACROIX	This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
DELACROIX	David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
MONA	I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."

DELACROIX	I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
MANTAN	Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
DELACROIX	I didn't mean it to sound like that.

MANTAN	That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
DELACROIX	Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
MANTAN	The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.

DELACROIX	Can I kiss you too?
MANTAN	Naw.  I'll take the zero.
DELACROIX	You feel good, not nervous?
MANTAN	I feel fine.
DELACROIX	Not nervous?  Relaxed?
MANTAN	Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.

DELACROIX	So they can be on TV.
MANTAN	You sound like the media.
DELACROIX	This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
MANTAN	Same thing Giuliani said.
DELACROIX	Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.

DELACROIX	No joke.  Serious.
MANTAN	Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
DELACROIX	In time.

DELACROIX	What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
MANTAN	No.
DELACROIX	You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
MANTAN	Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.

DELACROIX	You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
MANTAN	Yeah.
DELACROIX	And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.

DELACROIX	You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
MANTAN	What you did is dead wrong.
DELACROIX	Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
MANTAN	Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
DELACROIX	Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
MANTAN	I don't believe it.
DELACROIX	Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.

DELACROIX	Mantan, we got a show to tape.
MANTAN	My name is Manray, goddamnit.
DELACROIX	Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.

ORCHID	You must think I'm some kind of fool.
DELACROIX	It looks delicious.
ORCHID	You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
DELACROIX	C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
ORCHID	I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.

ORCHID	How's the food?
DELACROIX	Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
ORCHID	That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?

DELACROIX	It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
ORCHID	If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
DELACROIX	Mommy, please don't call me that.
ORCHID	Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
DELACROIX	I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
ORCHID	I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
DELACROIX	To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
ORCHID	Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
DELACROIX	Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
ORCHID	I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.

ORCHID	Peerless, your father called.
DELACROIX	I'll be right over.

ORCHID	He wants you to come and see him.
DELACROIX	He said that?
ORCHID	Yes he did.
DELACROIX	Where is he?
ORCHID	He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
DELACROIX	I can't go all the way down south.

ORCHID	Richmond is not all the way down south.
DELACROIX	I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
ORCHID	Regardless, he still is your father.
DELACROIX	It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
ORCHID	Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
DELACROIX	C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
ORCHID	Peerless, last time, go see your father.

ORCHID	I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
DELACROIX	You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
ORCHID	Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
DELACROIX	Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
ORCHID	No.
DELACROIX	Not at all?
ORCHID	You know how your Daddy is.
DELACROIX	If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
ORCHID	I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
DELACROIX	Soon.

DELACROIX	Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
JUKKA	I just turned twenty.

DELACROIX	Where are you from?
JUKKA	Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
DELACROIX	Finland.
JUKKA	You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
DELACROIX	Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
JUKKA	What's a Negro.

DELACROIX	A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
DELACROIX	Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
JUKKA	Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
DELACROIX	Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
JUKKA	Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.

DELACROIX	How did you get this gig?
JUKKA	My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
DELACROIX	This is a TV show, not a music video.
JUKKA	Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
DELACROIX	This is a travesty.  A debacle.

DELACROIX	Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
JUKKA	Thank you very much.  I always try my best.

DUNWITTY	I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
MYRNA	First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.

DUNWITTY	Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
MYRNA	The best defense is offense.

MYRNA	The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
DUNWITTY	We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.

DUNWITTY	Let Myrna finish.
MYRNA	Thank you.  And always smile.

DUNWITTY	Yes you!
MYRNA	This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.

MANRAY	I never had a really real pair before.
SLOAN	You've never had any formal training, either?
MANRAY	Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
SLOAN	I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
MANRAY	You sing and dance?
SLOAN	A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
MANRAY	So what's up with you and DeLa?
SLOAN	What do you mean?
MANRAY	Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.

SLOAN	No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
MANRAY	I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
SLOAN	If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
MANRAY	You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
SLOAN	Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
MANRAY	I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
SLOAN	I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.

TAVIS SMILEY	Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
MANTAN	Tavis, thank you for having me.
TAVIS SMILEY	Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
MANTAN	I'm more comfortable around my people.
TAVIS SMILEY	Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
MANTAN	Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."

TAVIS SMILEY	Money and nothing else?
MANTAN	Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
TAVIS SMILEY	Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
MANTAN	No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
TAVIS SMILEY	Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
MANTAN	I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
TAVIS SMILEY	I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. 

MANTAN	This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
SLEEP 'N EAT	And this is my very best friend Mantan.

MANTAN	We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
SLEEP 'N EAT	...the big apple, New York, New York.
MANTAN	To come back to our roots.
SLEEP 'N EAT	Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
MANTAN	No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
SLEEP 'N EAT	Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
MANTAN	Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
SLEEP 'N EAT	Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.

MANTAN	Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
SLEEP 'N EAT	You tellin' the truth.
MANTAN	Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!

MANTAN	Y'know my lady Lucindy?
SLEEP 'N EAT	The one with da big...
MANTAN	Not her, the one with the little...
SLEEP 'N EAT	Oh her.
MANTAN	Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...

SLEEP 'N EAT	No, not that.  How 'bout...
MANTAN	She hates dem.
SLEEP 'N EAT	Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
MANTAN	Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
SLEEP 'N EAT	Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
MANTAN	...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
SLEEP 'N EAT	That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.

SLEEP 'N EAT	Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
MANTAN	I thought you got rid of...
SLEEP 'N EAT	...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
MANTAN	...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
SLEEP 'N EAT	...aconite get it dat cheap.
MANTAN	I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
SLEEP 'N EAT	We should go out on a double date.

MANTAN	I heard ya lady is wild.
SLEEP 'N EAT	No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
MANTAN	Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
SLEEP 'N EAT	...no, she didn't...
MANTAN	...yes she did.
SLEEP 'N EAT	...I heard different, thought that was...
MANTAN	...not that time...
SLEEP 'N EAT	So when are you comin' to pick us up?
MANTAN	Around...
SLEEP 'N EAT	...too early...
MANTAN	...then what about...
SLEEP 'N EAT	...too late, maybe around...
MANTAN	...perfect...
SLEEP 'N EAT	That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
MANTAN	...like macaroni and cheese...
SLEEP 'N EAT	...like grits and butter...
MANTAN	...like fried and chicken...

MANTAN	I fell out of my bed last night.
SLEEP 'N EAT	You slept too near where you got in?
MANTAN	I slept too near where I fell out.
SLEEP 'N EAT	You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.

MANTAN	Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
SLEEP 'N EAT	Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
MANTAN	Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
SLEEP 'N EAT	Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
MANTAN	Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
SLEEP 'N EAT	How be dat?
MANTAN	I don't know who I am.
SLEEP 'N EAT	Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
MANTAN	Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 

MANTAN	Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
SLEEP 'N EAT	Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.

MANTAN	I feel a song a comin' on.
SLEEP 'N EAT	A song a comin' I feel.

SLOAN	People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
MANTAN	Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.

MANTAN	A lot?
SLOAN	Enough.

MANTAN	So what's up with you?
SLOAN	What do you want to know?
MANTAN	The good stuff.
SLOAN	I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
MANTAN	What else?
SLOAN	Are you trying to rap to me?

SLOAN	This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
MANTAN	Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
SLOAN	Oh you do, huh?
MANTAN	Just a little something' somethin'.
SLOAN	I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
MANTAN	Gots no intention of ending up broke.
SLOAN	Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
MANTAN	No, before my time.
SLOAN	You don't read, do you?
MANTAN	Never read a book in my whole life.
SLOAN	Maybe you need to start.
MANTAN	Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
SLOAN	Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?

MANTAN	Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
SLOAN	I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
MANTAN	We can look out for ourselves.

SLOAN	Why don't you call him?
MANTAN	For what?  He left.  Not me.

SLOAN	You're sure this is a good idea.
MANTAN	My people love me.

SLOAN	I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
MANTAN	Y'know what?
SLOAN	What?
MANTAN	You look beautiful like that.

MANTAN	How did you get this gig?
SLOAN	Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
MANTAN	You leave something out?
SLOAN	After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
MANTAN	And?
SLOAN	And what?
MANTAN	Stop playing me Sloan.
SLOAN	Just ask me what you want to know.
MANTAN	Oh, you gonna make me say it.
SLOAN	Say what, Manray?
MANTAN	Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
SLOAN	We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
MANTAN	Aw, c'mon.
SLOAN	That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.

MANTAN	So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
SLOAN	Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
MANTAN	Don't try to change to the subject.
SLOAN	Why don't you answer?
MANTAN	I know I won't be your puppet.
SLOAN	You can go now.
MANTAN	I wuz leaving anyway, for good.

ALEXEI	You first.
YURI	Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.

ALEXEI	Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
YURI	What for?
ALEXEI	You know what for.
YURI	No I don't.
ALEXEI	I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
YURI	I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
ALEXEI	Such as?

YURI	When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
ALEXEI	Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
YURI	I paid for those guitar cases.

ALEXEI	Yeah it was okay.
YURI	Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
ALEXEI	The sets were good.
YURI	The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.

NADIA	Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
ALEXEI	There's over eighty thousand here.

NADIA	It's enough isn't it?
ALEXEI	What do you mean?
NADIA	You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
ALEXEI	Do you want to stop?
NADIA	Yes.
ALEXEI	We'll stop then.

ALEXEI	What's this?
NADIA	It's nothing. I burnt myself.
ALEXEI	That's not a burn.
NADIA	It is. I did it cooking.

NADIA	Do you like it?
ALEXEI	Yeah.

NADIA	Say thank you.
ALEXEI	Thank you.

ALEXEI	What?
NADIA	You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.

ALEXEI	A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
NADIA	Name it.

ALEXEI	What? What are you doing?
NADIA	What are you doing here?

ALEXEI	What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
NADIA	Leave him!
ALEXEI	You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
NADIA	No I haven't.

BRANCH MANAGER	This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
JOHN	Ch...
BRANCH MANAGER	To customers approaching the bank from the rear
JOHN	Right.
BRANCH MANAGER	You can see why it's sensitive?
JOHN	Uh... Yes.

JOHN	Hello.
BRANCH MANAGER	I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
JOHN	Right.

YURI	How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
JOHN	Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
YURI	You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
JOHN	What are you doing here?

YURI	Sorry. You've lost me...
JOHN	I'm asking what you're here for.
YURI	What?

JOHN	What did he say?
YURI	He says he feels safe here.

JOHN	I need to know who you are first please.
YURI	Oh.  We are Russian.
JOHN	Yes. I know.
YURI	Good. 
JOHN	And...
YURI	And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.

JOHN	Hold on.
YURI	Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.

JOHN	So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
YURI	Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
JOHN	Right.
YURI	We better watch him. He's crazy.
JOHN	Right.
YURI	I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.

JOHN	No.
YURI	Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.

JOHN	So?
YURI	So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.

JOHN	What was that?
YURI	I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
JOHN	Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.

JOHN	So how long will you be in England?
YURI	Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
JOHN	You must have a visa or something...
YURI	You're asking for my documents?
JOHN	No, no...

YURI	She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
JOHN	Uh. Do you like England?
YURI	Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'

YURI	She says she has a secret to tell.
JOHN	What?

JOHN	When?
YURI	I saw you waiting there, by the gate.
JOHN	I...
YURI	I have these uh... She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.

JOHN	Binoculars.
YURI	Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.

JOHN	What was that?
YURI	Oh nothing.
JOHN	Tell me.
YURI	No. It is too judgmental.
JOHN	Tell me what he said.
YURI	He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.

YURI	You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
JOHN	No. It's not that.
YURI	Do you believe in love?
JOHN	I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
YURI	It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.

YURI	How is bank?
JOHN	Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
YURI	To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.

YURI	I understand. I'm so sorry
JOHN	You can stay tonight.
YURI	I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
JOHN	Good night.

JOHN	Put the fucking kettle down.
YURI	John.
JOHN	Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.

YURI	He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
JOHN	What? What does he want?

JOHN	What did he say? Tell me!
YURI	He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
JOHN	What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
YURI	He wants money.
JOHN	Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.

YURI	He wants a lot of money.
JOHN	I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
YURI	He wants the money from your bank.
JOHN	I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
YURI	You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
JOHN	I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.

JOHN	Oh Jesus.
YURI	He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
JOHN	Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.

JOHN	Just leave her alone.
YURI	I'm so sorry.
JOHN	Leave her alone.

JOHN	Is that everything?
NADIA	Yes.
JOHN	Right. Okay. Good.

JOHN	It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
NADIA	Yes.
JOHN	I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
NADIA	Yes.
JOHN	I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
NADIA	Yes.
JOHN	I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."

JOHN	So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
NADIA	Yes.
JOHN	I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
NADIA	Yes.

JOHN	And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
NADIA	Yes.

JOHN	Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
NADIA	Yes.
JOHN	Good. Or should I speak slower?
NADIA	Yes.
JOHN	Do you follow or should I speak slower?
NADIA	Yes.

JOHN	Uh... Are you a giraffe?
NADIA	Yes.

NADIA	Today is bath day.
JOHN	Sorry?

JOHN	I don't understand.
NADIA	Happy bath day.

JOHN	Syevodnya?
NADIA	Syevodnya
JOHN	Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.

NADIA	Frenzy.
JOHN	Yes I know.

NADIA	They go. John. They go.
JOHN	What's wrong?
NADIA	They go.
JOHN	Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
NADIA	They go.

JOHN	Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
NADIA	You don't understand anything.
JOHN	I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.

JOHN	Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
NADIA	It's makes it easier. Okay.
JOHN	I don't want to know.
NADIA	It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
JOHN	That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.

NADIA	So what are you going to do?
JOHN	I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
NADIA	They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
JOHN	Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
NADIA	Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
JOHN	Well as it turns out I did.

JOHN	You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
NADIA	No I don't.
JOHN	In the world.
NADIA	I know you just want to punish me --
JOHN	I do. I want to very badly.
NADIA	So you're just going to be vindictive
JOHN	In every sense. If at all possible.
NADIA	You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
JOHN	Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.

NADIA	Where's the restroom?
JOHN	What?
NADIA	I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
JOHN	What? No you're not..
NADIA	I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
JOHN	No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?

NADIA	You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
JOHN	Have you got your passport?
NADIA	What?
JOHN	Shut up. Have you got your passport?
NADIA	Yes.

JOHN	Give me some money.
NADIA	I don't have any money.

JOHN	What?
NADIA	I said I don't have any.

JOHN	So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
NADIA	I don't want to talk about him.
JOHN	Fine.
NADIA	It's none of your business.
JOHN	Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.

JOHN	So uh...
NADIA	Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
JOHN	Oh Jesus.
NADIA	If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
JOHN	Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
NADIA	But, you know, so what?

JOHN	Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
NADIA	He will come back.
JOHN	Excuse me?
NADIA	He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
JOHN	Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
NADIA	No. But you tend to tie them up.

JOHN	I don't want to talk about it.
NADIA	Why not?
JOHN	Shut up. I'm not listening.
NADIA	You don't want to talk about it.
JOHN	No.
NADIA	Okay we won't talk about it.

NADIA	We'll pretend it never happened.
JOHN	So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
NADIA	I don't hate you.
JOHN	Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
NADIA	And? What are you saying?
JOHN	And. It's wrong.
NADIA	And who says what is wrong.
JOHN	And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
NADIA	What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
JOHN	So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
NADIA	Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
JOHN	Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.

JOHN	So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
NADIA	Sometimes.
JOHN	Sometimes which?
NADIA	Sometimes neither.
JOHN	Some... What does that mean?
NADIA	There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
JOHN	I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
NADIA	Why?
JOHN	Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
NADIA	So now you hate all women?
JOHN	I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
NADIA	Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.

JOHN	What?
NADIA	You...
JOHN	I got what I paid for.
NADIA	You didn't mind too much.

JOHN	It wasn't what I wanted.
NADIA	So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
JOHN	You don't understand me.
NADIA	You don't understand you either.

NADIA	Excuse me?
JOHN	Get out
NADIA	You are throwing me out.
JOHN	Get out.

NADIA	You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
JOHN	You don't have to say anything
NADIA	What? I... I wasn't saying...
JOHN	Please, there's no... Oh.
NADIA	I wasn't saying anything.
JOHN	Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?

NADIA	Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
JOHN	Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
NADIA	The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
JOHN	Thank Christ for that.
NADIA	You are pretty naive if you think it is.
JOHN	I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
NADIA	I don't have nothing.
JOHN	Well what have you got?

JOHN	Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
NADIA	No.
JOHN	Have you had any before?
NADIA	No.
JOHN	Are you scared?
NADIA	Not really. Maybe a little.

NADIA	What happened between you and the blonde?
JOHN	What?
NADIA	The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
JOHN	It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
NADIA	Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
JOHN	She's dead.

NADIA	I'm sorry.
JOHN	I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.

NADIA	What?
JOHN	I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
NADIA	She's alive?

NADIA	She's alive!! She is not dead?
JOHN	Laugh it up.

JOHN	You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
NADIA	I'm trying to quit.
JOHN	I've got news for you. It's not working.
NADIA	I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
JOHN	Nobody's that unhappy.
NADIA	Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
JOHN	I don't want anyone to die.
NADIA	Except for Small Eyes.
JOHN	Except for Small Eyes.

JOHN	I don't know.
NADIA	What was her name?
JOHN	What's your name?

NADIA	You know you can come under the blanket.
JOHN	It's alright.

NADIA	I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
JOHN	No. I think I better just go.
NADIA	Okay. Thank you.
JOHN	Whatever.

JOHN	Yeah. No thanks.
NADIA	Please. Why not?
JOHN	Because it was a lie.

JOHN	Okay. Goodbye.
NADIA	Goodbye.

NADIA	Something else.
JOHN	Okay. Promise?

JOHN	You can probably buy them on the flight.
NADIA	I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
JOHN	Goodbye.
NADIA	You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
JOHN	Whatever.
NADIA	I'm sorry.
JOHN	Please.

NADIA	It's not mine.
JOHN	It's not mine either.
NADIA	It's what you came back for.

JOHN	Why?
NADIA	I'm not asking you to marry me.
JOHN	No. What? No. I know.
NADIA	It's more like a date.
JOHN	It's a long way to go for a date.
NADIA	Tell me about it.

JOHN	What does it mean?
NADIA	Maybe you will find out.

NADIA	Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
JOHN	Right.

NADIA	My name's Sophia.
JOHN	Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.

JOHN	Is the flight full?
OFFICIAL	I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
JOHN	Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.

OFFICIAL	You have excellent English.
JOHN	Thanks.
OFFICIAL	How do you want to pay?
JOHN	Cash.

ADAM	Hi!
MISS SWEET	Yes?
ADAM	I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.

MISS SWEET	Oh, now, that's a great one!
ADAM	You like it?
MISS SWEET	Bravo!
ADAM	Thank-Q!

MISS SWEET	This is my new friend...
ADAM	I'm Adam Webber.
MISS SWEET	He's really funny!

MISS SWEET	We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
ADAM	Really?

MISS SWEET	You're kidding!
ADAM	No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
MISS SWEET	Your mom was a dancer?
ADAM	She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
MISS SWEET	Sure.

ARON	I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
ADAM	How do you do?
ARON	Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
ADAM	Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
ARON	Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.

ARON	We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
ADAM	Come where?
ARON	My office.
ADAM	For how long?
ARON	Well, that depends...
ADAM	I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.

ARON	Let's go talk first, Adam.
ADAM	Yes, ma'am.

ADAM	The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
ARON	Young man, stop right there!

ADAM	How do you do?
CLIFF	I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?

CLIFF	But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
ADAM	Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
CLIFF	How 'bout a drink at the bar?

ADAM	Please excuse this interruption.
CLIFF	Oh, brother...

ADAM	Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
CLIFF	What?!
ADAM	I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
CLIFF	Shallow? I'm shallow?!

ADAM	Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
CLIFF	Do ya?

CLIFF	Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
ADAM	It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
CLIFF	Eve? I'm leaving.

ADAM	Bon soir, mademoiselle!
EVE	Are you French?
ADAM	No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
EVE	Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.

ADAM	Get out of here!
EVE	No, you get out of here.

EVE	Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
ADAM	Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.

ADAM	Where are we going?
EVE	We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
ADAM	No, I'm lost.
EVE	You're lost?
ADAM	Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
EVE	Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
ADAM	Dickhead?
EVE	A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.

EVE	What's wrong with you?
ADAM	I just had a mental picture of...
EVE	Here, pick these up!

ADAM	I came on a bus.
EVE	Why doesn't that surprise me?
ADAM	I don't know. Why doesn't it?

EVE	Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
ADAM	Oh, that's nice.
EVE	Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?

ADAM	So far?
EVE	Yes, I'm right?
ADAM	Right.
EVE	I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
ADAM	Again.
EVE	Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
ADAM	Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
EVE	See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
ADAM	It was amazing.
EVE	Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
ADAM	Do you own a car?
EVE	I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
ADAM	If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
EVE	You don't?
ADAM	Nope.
EVE	Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!

ADAM	I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
EVE	Get away from me!!

ADAM	Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
EVE	Rogers Hornsby?!?
ADAM	He's all yours. I was holding him back.

EVE	Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
ADAM	So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.

EVE	So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
ADAM	Yes.
EVE	And that's it?
ADAM	Yes.
EVE	I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
ADAM	Heck, no!  What?!
EVE	Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.

EVE	So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
ADAM	It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
EVE	Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.

ADAM	Wait!  Wait!
EVE	What is it?!
ADAM	It's Perry!
EVE	Perry?
ADAM	Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
EVE	Okay, okay!  Take it easy!

EVE	How's that?
ADAM	Oh, I could die...
EVE	Over this?
ADAM	Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
EVE	You are one scary son-of-a-gun.

ADAM	Hey, what are you doing?!
EVE	I know a short-cut.

ADAM	Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
EVE	I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!

ADAM	That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
EVE	Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
ADAM	Right.

ADAM	I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
EVE	Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
ADAM	I can't, it's yours.
EVE	Take it. damn it!
ADAM	Okay.

EVE	Why are you doing that?
ADAM	I haven't brushed yet.
EVE	Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.

ADAM	Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
EVE	Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

EVE	I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
ADAM	Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
EVE	Okay!  Damn!

ADAM	Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
EVE	No.
ADAM	Thank-Q!
EVE	Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
ADAM	I think it's the eyes.
EVE	The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
ADAM	Watching television in color.
EVE	Hey, no kidding?  In color?
ADAM	Cross my heart and hope to die.

EVE	See, ya.
ADAM	Why doesn't it never work out?
EVE	What?
ADAM	Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
EVE	Why?!  Who the hell knows?!

ADAM	...Okay.
EVE	It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
ADAM	Why not go to work for me?
EVE	Doing what?
ADAM	Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
EVE	Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?

ADAM	Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
EVE	How long would you need me?
ADAM	Two weeks.
EVE	What's the pay?
ADAM	What's fair?
EVE	I've got to make at least a thousand a week.

ADAM	You got it! Wait here while I change.
EVE	Sure.

EVE	Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
ADAM	They like Dr. Pepper.
EVE	Who are these people?
ADAM	My Mom and Dad.
EVE	Very funny, smart ass.
ADAM	Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!

ADAM	Wait! Wait!
EVE	What?

EVE	Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
ADAM	Sorry.

EVE	Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
ADAM	Hey, you know. I was thinking...
EVE	Night!

ADAM	We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
EVE	It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
ADAM	I guess we'll need another locker.
EVE	No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
ADAM	You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.

EVE	Thank you.
ADAM	And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
EVE	Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
ADAM	Okay.
EVE	Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.

ADAM	There's something else I would like you to help me with.
EVE	Name it.
ADAM	Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
EVE	Oh, I'm sure it will!
ADAM	Then forget it.
EVE	No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
ADAM	This is for me.
EVE	Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.

ADAM	Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
EVE	A wife?
ADAM	Yes.
EVE	What for?
ADAM	Because I want to get married.
EVE	Why?!
ADAM	I don't want to be alone.
EVE	You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
ADAM	Bites what?
EVE	The big one!
ADAM	It does?
EVE	Sure.
ADAM	I didn't know that.
EVE	Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
ADAM	They're all divorced?
EVE	Everybody's divorced.
ADAM	It didn't used to be that way.
EVE	I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
ADAM	One who's not a mutant.
EVE	No dogs, huh? Okay.
ADAM	And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.

EVE	When do you need her by?
ADAM	Two weeks.
EVE	Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
ADAM	That's what I was afraid of.

EVE	Could we talk about that a little later?
ADAM	Of course.
EVE	Thank you.

EVE	Get out!
ADAM	The engine is still running.

EVE	Now, get out!!
ADAM	Yes, ma'am!
EVE	Stop that ma'am crap!
ADAM	Sorry!

EVE	You almost got us killed!
ADAM	I told you I've never driven before!
EVE	Never drive again!
ADAM	You said it would be easy!
EVE	I was wrong!!
ADAM	Is this your house?
EVE	Yes!
ADAM	I like it.

ADAM	Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
EVE	He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
ADAM	Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
EVE	What?!

EVE	Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
ADAM	Thank-Q!
EVE	I thought only hookers drank those things.
ADAM	Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

EVE	Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
ADAM	Um-hum.
EVE	I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
ADAM	Yes!
EVE	You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
ADAM	Wow.

EVE	Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
ADAM	Good for you.

ADAM	Where's he gone?
EVE	He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
ADAM	He has a computer?
EVE	Sure.
ADAM	In the house?
EVE	No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
ADAM	May I please be excused?
EVE	Uh...yeah.

ADAM	All right.
EVE	So, what are you seeing?

ADAM	The what?
EVE	Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?

ADAM	The guy with the underpants!
EVE	That's boring!

ADAM	About clothing?
EVE	Yeah.
ADAM	Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.

EVE	What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
ADAM	It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!

EVE	He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
ADAM	Okay!

ADAM	Hey, Eve!
EVE	Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
ADAM	Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
EVE	Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
ADAM	I certainly do!
EVE	Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
ADAM	No it's not!
EVE	Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
ADAM	Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
EVE	Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
ADAM	Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
EVE	Well...yeah. Okay.

ADAM	My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
EVE	Look unimpressed.

EVE	No!  Not crazy!
ADAM	Do I look crazy?
EVE	Yes!

EVE	Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
ADAM	Good-bye!

ADAM	I thought I was here to meet women.
EVE	Not that one!
ADAM	I like her.
EVE	And don't be so obvious!

EVE	What have you ordered?
ADAM	It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.

ADAM	What about her?
EVE	No way.
ADAM	Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
EVE	Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
ADAM	Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
EVE	Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
ADAM	How 'bout this one?

ADAM	Okay. I like that.
EVE	Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
ADAM	What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?

ADAM	Really?
EVE	Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!

ADAM	That's ridiculous.
EVE	Maybe. But that's how it works.

EVE	Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
ADAM	Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
EVE	Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.

EVE	What?
ADAM	Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
EVE	Did you?

ADAM	You wanted to see me!
EVE	You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
ADAM	Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
EVE	Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
ADAM	I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
EVE	You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
ADAM	No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
EVE	I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
ADAM	All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--

EVE	Adam?!
ADAM	I'm sorry.

EVE	I don't blame you!
ADAM	Eve, I'm sorry.

EVE	I'm leaving, too.
ADAM	But, Eve, I would--
EVE	And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!

ADAM	Eve?!
EVE	Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
ADAM	I'm really sorry!
EVE	What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
ADAM	I know...and I'm really sorry.
EVE	Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
ADAM	What?
EVE	Goodnight!

ADAM	Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
EVE	Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
ADAM	I know first aid!
EVE	Well, you had better!!

EVE	There.
ADAM	Thanks.

ADAM	I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
EVE	Is that what you call it?
ADAM	But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
EVE	Sing it to me.
ADAM	All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live.  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.

EVE	Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
ADAM	No.

EVE	Uh-huh. Adam?
ADAM	Yes, Eve?
EVE	I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
ADAM	Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.

EVE	That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
ADAM	Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
EVE	My pleasure.
ADAM	It was at least as good as the sky.
EVE	Really?  Okay!
ADAM	And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
EVE	Neat. Goodnight!

ADAM	Hi, Eve!
EVE	Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....

EVE	Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
ADAM	...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
EVE	...I do.
ADAM	Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.

EVE	No.
ADAM	See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
EVE	We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
ADAM	My mother's like that.

ADAM	Is that a birthday cake?!
CLERK	Yes, it is.
ADAM	Gee-ma-nee!

ADAM	Is this because of the radiation?
CLERK	What?
ADAM	Nothing.

ADAM	Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
CLERK	Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
ADAM	A card?
CLERK	Yes, sir.
ADAM	Of course!

ADAM	Are you all right?
SODA JERK	Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
ADAM	All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
SODA JERK	Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
ADAM	I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
SODA JERK	Yes.
ADAM	I've got to go, now.
SODA JERK	Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
ADAM	That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
SODA JERK	No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
ADAM	How do I leave here?
SODA JERK	The front door is open.  Will you be back?
ADAM	I promise.

ADAM	I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
SODA JERK	Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.

CALVIN	This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
ADAM	They're pretty.  Can I have them?
CALVIN	Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
ADAM	Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
CALVIN	You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
ADAM	Tempus fugit!
CALVIN	En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
ADAM	Gerade aus dann links!
CALVIN	Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
ADAM	Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
CALVIN	You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.

ADAM	These are wonderful.
CALVIN	It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
ADAM	What's baseball?
CALVIN	It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
ADAM	Like a painting?
CALVIN	No, son. A pitcher.
ADAM	Like one of Mom's?
CALVIN	Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
ADAM	The nocturnal flying mammal?
CALVIN	No. Sit down.

CALVIN	No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
ADAM	Why?
CALVIN	Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
ADAM	Then why go there?
CALVIN	Because he must!

ADAM	Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
CALVIN	Blow out the candles!

ADAM	Oh, boy! A jacket!
CALVIN	Your mom made that all by herself.
ADAM	No kidding!

ADAM	Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
CALVIN	Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
ADAM	These are really swell! I mean swell!

ADAM	Well, do we just go on up?!
CALVIN	No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.

CALVIN	Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
ADAM	Shit is a French word?

CALVIN	C'est bon, Monsieur.
ADAM	Merci!

CALVIN	Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
ADAM	Yes, father?! Yes?
CALVIN	...the pipe tobacco.
ADAM	Yes, sir.  Is that all?

CALVIN	Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
ADAM	Adult Bookstore.  Why?
CALVIN	Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
ADAM	I promise. Is that all?
CALVIN	One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
ADAM	I'll try.

CALVIN	But, I don't understand.
ADAM	And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
CALVIN	Well, in that case...of course, son.

CALVIN	This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
ADAM	It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
CALVIN	Uh-huh.
ADAM	Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
CALVIN	You're sure?
ADAM	Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
CALVIN	That's what everybody believes?
ADAM	Yes, sir. It's true.
CALVIN	What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
ADAM	Yes. That's kind of how it was.
CALVIN	Uh-huh.

CALVIN	My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
ADAM	Uh, I think they have.
CALVIN	Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!

ADAM	You have very nice ceilings.
TROY	I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
ADAM	Not particularly.
TROY	Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
ADAM	I love Lucy!
TROY	You nut!

ADAM	It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
TROY	And it's called...?
ADAM	Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
TROY	Really?  Since when?

ADAM	Right on the button.
TROY	Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.

TROY	That's right?
ADAM	I've never met anyone like you in my life.
TROY	She's right?!

ADAM	I've got goose-bumps all over me.
TROY	Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?

TROY	Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
ADAM	1959.
TROY	Who use to own it?
ADAM	Russia.
TROY	When did we get it from them?
ADAM	1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
TROY	What's the capitol?
ADAM	Juneau.
TROY	Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
ADAM	Sorry, that's the largest city.

ADAM	This must be very new.
TROY	Yeah.
ADAM	It's so small.
TROY	What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
ADAM	I don't think so.
TROY	You don't have a computer in your cabin?
ADAM	No.
TROY	How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
ADAM	Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
TROY	Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
ADAM	That would knock my father out.
TROY	Yeah?
ADAM	Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
TROY	He's a Windows guy then, huh?
ADAM	Yes. He likes windows.
TROY	Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
ADAM	...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
TROY	True.

TROY	Not on him.
ADAM	I'm not wearing his pants.
TROY	Why not? He has great pants.
ADAM	I just don't want to.
TROY	Okay.

TROY	Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
ADAM	No.

ADAM	I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
TROY	Almost all of them.
ADAM	The recovery is very impressive.
TROY	The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
ADAM	Amazing. I'm very impressed.

TROY	That's why little things mean so much to him.
ADAM	I LOVE THIS!!

ADAM	Why did you park way back there?
TROY	Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
ADAM	Oh. I see.

TROY	What?!
ADAM	Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

TROY	Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
ADAM	Okay. Thank you, my friends.

TROY	I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
ADAM	No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!

ADAM	Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
TROY	How 'bout we check with Eve first?
ADAM	You bet!
TROY	So, did you buy a movie?
ADAM	What?
TROY	A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
ADAM	No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
TROY	I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
ADAM	Does that work?
TROY	Yeah...Seems to.

TROY	Good-bye, Adam.
ADAM	Goodbye.

ADAM	Bye, Troy!
TROY	Bye, Adam!
ADAM	And thanks for always being happy!
TROY	What?

BELLBOY	You dial nine to get out.
ADAM	Of what?
BELLBOY	The hotel.
ADAM	I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.

BELLBOY	Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
ADAM	My father is a genius.
BELLBOY	No kiddin'. Well...good night.
ADAM	Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
BELLBOY	How old are you?
ADAM	Thirty-five.
BELLBOY	You don't look thirty-five.
ADAM	How old do I look?
BELLBOY	Twenty-five? Around there.
ADAM	I guess living up here makes people look older.
BELLBOY	Up here on the fifteenth floor?
ADAM	Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
BELLBOY	Goodnight.

BYSTANDER #1	What?  What is it?!
ADAM	The sky!!!
BYSTANDER #1	The sky?  Where?
ADAM	Up there!!
BYSTANDER #1	I don't see anything!
ADAM	Just look!!

BUTCHER	Help you?
ADAM	Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.

ADAM	Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
BUTCHER	Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
ADAM	Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
BUTCHER	You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.

BUTCHER	Sure.
ADAM	Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
BUTCHER	Gladly.

POSTAL WORKER	Whatcha looking at?
ADAM	Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
POSTAL WORKER	Say what?!
ADAM	How do you do, ma'am.
POSTAL WORKER	I do alright.
ADAM	Good!

ADAM	Hello.
JERRY	Hi.

JERRY	How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
ADAM	I was thinking of selling all the cards.
JERRY	Really? No kidding?

ADAM	See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
JERRY	I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
ADAM	Oh, that would be wonderful!
JERRY	Well, we're here to help!

ADAM	Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
JERRY	Oh, you got a problem with that?

ADAM	I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
JERRY	Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?

HELEN	Oh. A nice one, I hope.
ADAM	Yes, ma'am.

HELEN	Elbows, Son.
ADAM	Sorry, Mom!
HELEN	You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.

ADAM	Dad!
HELEN	Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.

HELEN	He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
ADAM	I'll go up.

HELEN	I'm afraid you've got to.
ADAM	I'll be all right.
HELEN	You're my brave boy.

HELEN	I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
ADAM	Yes, ma'am.

ADAM	Right.
HELEN	I just hope this is still good up there.
ADAM	Mom?

HELEN	Yes?
ADAM	I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.

HELEN	Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
ADAM	Yes, ma'am.

HELEN	Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
ADAM	Yes, ma'am.
HELEN	Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
ADAM	Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.

ADAM	...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
HELEN	Are you in trouble, son?!
ADAM	I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
HELEN	A psychiatrist?!

ADAM	Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
HELEN	What?
ADAM	I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.

ADAM	We have to go.
HELEN	No, wait! At least stay for dinner!

HELEN	This is your bedroom?
ADAM	No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
HELEN	Well, where are you --
ADAM	Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
HELEN	No.
ADAM	Yes.

EVE	Oh, my God!
ARON	He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
EVE	No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
ARON	I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
EVE	No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
ARON	Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
EVE	You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
ARON	And now you must let me be the judge of that!
EVE	I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
ARON	Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.

LEVY	According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
ATKINSON	Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
LEVY	Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
ATKINSON	What about relatives?
LEVY	All back East.
ATKINSON	The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
LEVY	He drank it hot?
ATKINSON	Yeah.
LEVY	Good god.
ATKINSON	Yeah.

STREET WALKER	You got a light, honey?
CALVIN	What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
STREET WALKER	Good.

CALVIN	So...you...survived the blast, did you?
STREET WALKER	The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
CALVIN	Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
STREET WALKER	Hell up here?  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
CALVIN	Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
STREET WALKER	Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
CALVIN	Really?
STREET WALKER	Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
CALVIN	No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...

HELEN	For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
CALVIN	Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
HELEN	Well, put it down and come in!
CALVIN	You bet, hon!

CALVIN	I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
HELEN	We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?

CALVIN	It's time.
HELEN	Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--

CALVIN	It shuts off automatically.
HELEN	Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
CALVIN	No.  They all do.
HELEN	I never know anymore.

CALVIN	You hear that?!
HELEN	Yes.

HELEN	Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
CALVIN	I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
HELEN	Cheese is particularly troublesome.
CALVIN	Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
HELEN	Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
CALVIN	Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.

HELEN	How long will we have to stay down here?
CALVIN	I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
HELEN	Days??
CALVIN	Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
HELEN	But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
CALVIN	I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
HELEN	Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
CALVIN	Yes, dear!
HELEN	As long as we've got that straight.

CALVIN	Home sweet home!
HELEN	To you maybe.

HELEN	What's that noise?
CALVIN	The locks.
HELEN	The locks?
CALVIN	To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
HELEN	Thirty -five years!
CALVIN	Then after that it's safe.
HELEN	It's safe.

CALVIN	To go up.
HELEN	To go up.

CALVIN	Hi, honey! Feeling better?
HELEN	No.
CALVIN	We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
HELEN	All our friends...

CALVIN	Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
HELEN	I'm not hungry.
CALVIN	Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
HELEN	No, Calvin, you're favorite.
CALVIN	Really?

HELEN	Maybe I've just got the creeps.
CALVIN	How could you?! This is just like home!

HELEN	No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
CALVIN	Would you like a tranquilizer?
HELEN	You have tranquilizers?
CALVIN	I told you! I've got everything!

HELEN	Oh, no.
CALVIN	What?
HELEN	Uh, oh. Now it's time.
CALVIN	Honey?

CALVIN	Is there a problem?
HELEN	No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
CALVIN	I've noticed.
HELEN	What shall we call him?

CALVIN	No.  I think it's just right.
HELEN	And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
CALVIN	Yes!
HELEN	If I...you know...
CALVIN	What? Whatever you want, Helen!

HELEN	Calvin?!
CALVIN	Right here!
HELEN	We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
CALVIN	Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
HELEN	Why?
CALVIN	No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
HELEN	Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
CALVIN	Yes.  Well... yes.

HELEN	Watch this!
CALVIN	What?

CALVIN	Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
HELEN	Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
CALVIN	Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!

CALVIN	Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
HELEN	Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
CALVIN	I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.

CALVIN	Hi, honey!
HELEN	Hi.

HELEN	Calvin!
CALVIN	Coming!

HELEN	Get the presents and do the lights.
CALVIN	You bet.

HELEN	No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
CALVIN	And I made these!

HELEN	What did you wish for, Adam?
CALVIN	If he tells, it won't come true!
HELEN	Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
CALVIN	Well, we did in my family!

CALVIN	One who doesn't glow in the dark.
HELEN	Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
CALVIN	Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.

HELEN	Let's eat our cake.
CALVIN	Yeah. Let's dig in!

CALVIN	If we still have one.
HELEN	Yes...
CALVIN	You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
HELEN	Would you excuse me?
CALVIN	Sure.

CALVIN	In the generator room again?
HELEN	Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
CALVIN	I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?

CALVIN	Should we say a little prayer first?
HELEN	Just open the door.

HELEN	Yes, yes it is!
CALVIN	It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
HELEN	Yes! That's right!

CALVIN	I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
HELEN	Mutants?!
CALVIN	It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!

CALVIN	Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
HELEN	No.
CALVIN	Yes.
HELEN	I don't believe it!

CALVIN	They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
HELEN	Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
CALVIN	We stay down here.
HELEN	We do?
CALVIN	Yes.
HELEN	Excuse me.

HELEN	For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
CALVIN	We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
HELEN	No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
CALVIN	Well, I am the head of this household--
HELEN	I want him to at least see the sky!
CALVIN	--and we will--
HELEN	And the ocean!  A mountain range!
CALVIN	--do as I say!

CALVIN	He's smart.
HELEN	Yes, dear, I know.

CALVIN	And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
HELEN	Amen.

HELEN	How long will you set it for this time?
CALVIN	I thought ten years.
HELEN	Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
CALVIN	To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.

HELEN	Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
CALVIN	Some time.
HELEN	What can I offer you, Eve?

CLIFF	What are you bitching about now?
EVE	What are you doing here?
CLIFF	I forgot some of my stuff.
EVE	Your stuff?  Let me see that.

EVE	You came back for these?
CLIFF	Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
EVE	This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.

EVE	Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
CLIFF	Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!

EVE	So where is your roommate, the model?
CLIFF	You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.

EVE	Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
CLIFF	Yeah. Before I kick your ass.

EVE	Stop it, you two!
CLIFF	I guess we shouldn't fight in here.

TROY	Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
EVE	I knew you'd like him.
TROY	Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.

TROY	So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
EVE	Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

EVE	Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
TROY	Oh, yes.
EVE	I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?

EVE	Give me your hand.
TROY	Oh, my God...

TROY	But first, you have to start with the clothes!
EVE	Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.

TROY	I don't know.
EVE	Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.

TROY	You're serious, aren't you?
EVE	What's that supposed to mean?
TROY	It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
EVE	Well, that's blunt!
TROY	I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
EVE	And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
TROY	I see "elegant."
EVE	Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
TROY	That's what I'm sensing.

TROY	Alright, I will.
EVE	I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
TROY	What do you think, Adam?

TROY	Well, what do you think?
EVE	I think...it...works.
TROY	Let me show you the entire trousseau!

TROY	How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
EVE	No.

EVE	That water's freezing!
TROY	He's from Alaska.

EVE	Just be yourself.
TROY	Always good advice.
EVE	For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.

EVE	Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
TROY	Eve?!
EVE	Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
TROY	Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."

TROY	Um... Eve?
EVE	It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.

EVE	Go to the bathroom.
TROY	Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!

EVE	He go back to the hotel?
TROY	Uh..he might of.

EVE	What's that mean?
TROY	We did not leave together.
EVE	Who did he leave with?

TROY	What's it to you?!
EVE	I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
TROY	Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
EVE	Those sluts!
TROY	Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?

EVE	Where are you going?
TROY	To bed.
EVE	To bed?
TROY	Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
EVE	What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!

EVE	In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
TROY	Yes, you do.
EVE	And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
TROY	Uh, yes, you do.
EVE	Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
TROY	Yes, you do!
EVE	Or have perfect table manners.
TROY	You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
EVE	What?
TROY	He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
EVE	Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
TROY	Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
EVE	Where did he get all that information?
TROY	From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
EVE	So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
TROY	He didn't leave with them.
EVE	Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
TROY	He left with Sophie.
EVE	What?!!
TROY	It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
EVE	Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!

TROY	What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
EVE	You're goddamn right I am!

TROY	I don't think so.
EVE	Coward!

EVE	Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
TROY	I know...I know. You did the right thing.

EVE	Oh, no!
TROY	What?!

EVE	Gay.
TROY	Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!

EVE	Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
TROY	Fallout shelter.

TROY	What do you want to do with it?
EVE	Give it back to him.
TROY	And if we can't find him?
EVE	We'll find him.

TROY	What's wrong?
EVE	I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
TROY	See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.

TROY	Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
EVE	Have him committed.
TROY	Yeah! That's thinking.
EVE	He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
TROY	I don't know. I like to think so.
EVE	Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
TROY	To get some frozen poultry.
EVE	Then what?
TROY	We came back to the house!
EVE	You didn't stop anywhere else?!
TROY	No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
EVE	What?!
TROY	An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
EVE	Come on.

EVE	Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
TROY	None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
EVE	Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
TROY	Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.

EVE	Adam!!
TROY	Where?!
EVE	Stop!

MOM	I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
SODA JERK	You bet, Mom! Coming up!

MOM	I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
SODA JERK	Uh...yeah. It's like hard.

MOM	I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
SODA JERK	Um...uh...

MOM	I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
SODA JERK	Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
MOM	Buy it from me?
SODA JERK	Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
MOM	I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.

PILOT	Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
TOWER	Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
PILOT	Stand by. One.

TOWER	Wolf One -- say intentions.
PILOT	I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
TOWER	Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?

PILOT	Tower, say again!!
TOWER	The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
PILOT	I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
TOWER	Roger, Wolf One.

DIGNAN	What color hair does he have?
ANTHONY	Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
DIGNAN	Making Hutch David Soul?
ANTHONY	Right. The blond guy.
DIGNAN	OK. That's wrong.
ANTHONY	Dignan, it's --
DIGNAN	Plus where's Huggie Bear?
ANTHONY	He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
DIGNAN	I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
ANTHONY	No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.

DIGNAN	Why?
ANTHONY	As part of his plan. I don't know why.
DIGNAN	See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
ANTHONY	The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
DIGNAN	What does Starsky say?
ANTHONY	He says. This is he.
DIGNAN	This is he?
ANTHONY	No. This is he.

ANTHONY	Did you see what I meant about the window?
DIGNAN	Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
ANTHONY	That's true. But what if they change the locks?
DIGNAN	Would they do that?
ANTHONY	Who knows? That's why I filed it down.

ANTHONY	Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
DIGNAN	See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --

ANTHONY	She's really kind of hot.
DIGNAN	She's an attractive older woman.

ANTHONY	It's got a V-8, Dignan.
DIGNAN	What do you think the cops have?

DIGNAN	Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
ANTHONY	But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
DIGNAN	I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.

ANTHONY	The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
DIGNAN	Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
ANTHONY	That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
DIGNAN	Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
ANTHONY	Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?

ANTHONY	Where are you going?
DIGNAN	I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
ANTHONY	How was I ridiculing you?
DIGNAN	You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
ANTHONY	That's not what I meant, Dignan.

DIGNAN	Did you see that?
ANTHONY	Yeah, I saw it.
DIGNAN	I'm lookout.
ANTHONY	Dignan, it's got an alarm.
DIGNAN	I don't think so. Just reach on in.
ANTHONY	That sets it off.
DIGNAN	No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.

ANTHONY	It had an alarm.
DIGNAN	Yeah, I heard that.
ANTHONY	Five, seven, eight dollars.

DIGNAN	Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
ANTHONY	Eight dollars.
DIGNAN	That's not bad.

ANTHONY	But he didn't say anything.
DIGNAN	Hang on a second.

ANTHONY	Is it back in?
DIGNAN	Yeah.

DIGNAN	Loop around real fast.
ANTHONY	Just turn right here.

DIGNAN	OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
ANTHONY	You think we're going to be chased?
DIGNAN	That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --

DIGNAN	Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
ANTHONY	Nothing. Go ahead.

DIGNAN	Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
ANTHONY	No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.

ANTHONY	Dignan, calm down.
DIGNAN	You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
ANTHONY	Dignan! Stop!

ANTHONY	Calm down. Take a deep breath.
DIGNAN	You're right. You're right.

ANTHONY	Where's the manager?
DIGNAN	Where's the other stocker?
ANTHONY	There's another stocker, right?
DIGNAN	We know there's another stocker.

ANTHONY	Is that the manager?
DIGNAN	Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.

ANTHONY	Holy shit.
DIGNAN	We got it. We got it.

ANTHONY	What about what that guy said?
DIGNAN	Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.

DIGNAN	I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
ANTHONY	Like he meant it.
DIGNAN	Yeah.
ANTHONY	Like he would find Dignan. One day.
DIGNAN	Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.

DIGNAN	What's wrong with him?
ANTHONY	What do you think?
DIGNAN	Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
ANTHONY	He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
DIGNAN	I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
ANTHONY	Don't even say it, man.

DIGNAN	Can I get that credit card from you?
ANTHONY	I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
DIGNAN	Why not?
ANTHONY	Because my mom gets the bill.
DIGNAN	She's not going to notice, Anthony.
ANTHONY	I don't want to use it.
DIGNAN	Well, then cut it in half.
ANTHONY	I keep it for emergencies.
DIGNAN	Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...

DIGNAN	See if mine are in there.
ANTHONY	Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
DIGNAN	Yes, they are.
ANTHONY	Look at the treads on those.
DIGNAN	What about them?
ANTHONY	They obviously weren't designed for racing.
DIGNAN	Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.

DIGNAN	Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
ANTHONY	You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
DIGNAN	That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
ANTHONY	Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
DIGNAN	You were spoiled rotten.

ANTHONY	I'll just say it.
DIGNAN	I'll say it.
ANTHONY	OK. Go ahead.
DIGNAN	On your marks...  Get set go.

DIGNAN	You owe me fifty bucks.
ANTHONY	Bob?

ANTHONY	Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
DIGNAN	No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
ANTHONY	It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.

DIGNAN	Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
ANTHONY	I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
DIGNAN	Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
ANTHONY	It's not a plan. It's just --
DIGNAN	Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
ANTHONY	Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
DIGNAN	True.

ANTHONY	Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
DIGNAN	Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.

ANTHONY	No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
DIGNAN	Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?

ANTHONY	I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
DIGNAN	No. We didn't.

ANTHONY	This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
DIGNAN	Hi.
ANTHONY	Inez, this is --
DIGNAN	Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.

DIGNAN	May I have a word with you, please?
ANTHONY	Sure.

DIGNAN	What the fuck is going on here?
ANTHONY	What. What's the matter?
DIGNAN	Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
ANTHONY	No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
DIGNAN	They don't?
ANTHONY	No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
DIGNAN	Which one was that?
ANTHONY	On the left.

ANTHONY	She's from Cuba.
DIGNAN	No kidding.

DIGNAN	He needs to hire an attorney.
ANTHONY	No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.

DIGNAN	Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
ANTHONY	As long as he gets out OK.
DIGNAN	Obviously. That's a given.
ANTHONY	Bob?

DIGNAN	See, now we've got a plan.
ANTHONY	Don't worry about it, Bob.

DIGNAN	See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
ANTHONY	This was in fourth grade.
DIGNAN	Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
ANTHONY	After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
DIGNAN	They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.

ANTHONY	But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
DIGNAN	Yes... It's true.

DIGNAN	He's gone. He stole the car.
ANTHONY	Where was it parked?
DIGNAN	Right here.

DIGNAN	That coward. Son of a bitch.
ANTHONY	Maybe he just went to the store.
DIGNAN	He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.

ANTHONY	He went back for his brother.
DIGNAN	We said 48 hours.
ANTHONY	That's a long time to be in jail.

DIGNAN	When'd he tell you?
ANTHONY	This morning.
DIGNAN	Where was I?
ANTHONY	You were asleep.
DIGNAN	He told you and you let him do it.
ANTHONY	He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
DIGNAN	If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
ANTHONY	Well, I didn't do it, did I?
DIGNAN	So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
ANTHONY	Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
DIGNAN	I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
ANTHONY	If you say so.

DIGNAN	If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
ANTHONY	I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
DIGNAN	Well, the world is a little bit colder today.

ANTHONY	We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
DIGNAN	No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.

ANTHONY	Why don't you come with us.
DIGNAN	OK.

ANTHONY	I can't believe he just jumped you.
DIGNAN	Can you hand me those french fries.

ANTHONY	I wish I'd been there.
DIGNAN	Would of been nice.

ANTHONY	Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
DIGNAN	I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
ANTHONY	We need a car.

DIGNAN	I have an idea for that.
ANTHONY	What?
DIGNAN	Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
ANTHONY	I don't think we can do that.
DIGNAN	I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
ANTHONY	What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
DIGNAN	She doesn't need to know.
ANTHONY	I don't know, Dignan. I just --
DIGNAN	Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
ANTHONY	Shh.
DIGNAN	No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
ANTHONY	Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.

ANTHONY	I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
DIGNAN	You don't know how to hotwire.
ANTHONY	Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
DIGNAN	Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
ANTHONY	No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.

ANTHONY	I think we better go home.
DIGNAN	Don't panic, Anthony.
ANTHONY	I'm not. But there's --
DIGNAN	You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
ANTHONY	Our money situation is not good.
DIGNAN	You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
ANTHONY	We've got sixteen dollars.
DIGNAN	That's not correct.

DIGNAN	Sixteen dollars.
ANTHONY	I know.
DIGNAN	Where's the rest?

ANTHONY	I had to give some to Inez.
DIGNAN	How much?
ANTHONY	$383.

DIGNAN	You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
ANTHONY	She needed it.
DIGNAN	A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
ANTHONY	Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
DIGNAN	That's what she is!
ANTHONY	I know that. But --
DIGNAN	You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
ANTHONY	Shut up!
DIGNAN	What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --

ANTHONY	When'd you get back?
DIGNAN	Ah. Couple days ago.

ANTHONY	Who's in the car?
DIGNAN	That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
ANTHONY	Sure.

DIGNAN	Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
ANTHONY	You really hit a guy with a bottle?

DIGNAN	I want you to look at this.
ANTHONY	What is it?
DIGNAN	It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
ANTHONY	What's Hinckley Cold Storage?

DIGNAN	Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
ANTHONY	Who's Mr. Henry?
DIGNAN	You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.

ANTHONY	What exactly is this place? Freezers?
DIGNAN	Right. Freezers. Imported foods.

ANTHONY	What time did he say to be here?
DIGNAN	Right now.

ANTHONY	You could give somebody a concussion.
DIGNAN	Let me feel that.

DIGNAN	What do you think?
ANTHONY	He seems pretty good.

ANTHONY	Dignan. Take it easy.
DIGNAN	Bob!

ANTHONY	He doesn't want to fight.
DIGNAN	Get out of the way.
ANTHONY	No, Dignan. This isn't --

DIGNAN	No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
ANTHONY	Easy, Dignan. It's OK.

ANTHONY	Shit, Dignan.
DIGNAN	What the fuck are we doing out here?
ANTHONY	I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
DIGNAN	I'm sorry, Bob.

DIGNAN	OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
ANTHONY	Eleven fifteen.
DIGNAN	OK. Mark that down.
ANTHONY	I did.

DIGNAN	God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
ANTHONY	Yeah. It's pretty good.
DIGNAN	It's like we've finally arrived.

DIGNAN	Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
ANTHONY	Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.

ANTHONY	Or I might end up with a broken nose.
DIGNAN	Did that hurt?

ANTHONY	I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
DIGNAN	I don't think you will.
ANTHONY	I don't want to be too much of a liability.
DIGNAN	Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
ANTHONY	I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.

ANTHONY	He was a nice guy.
DIGNAN	He was all right.

ANTHONY	Do you like Inez?
DIGNAN	As a person?
ANTHONY	Yeah. As a girl.
DIGNAN	Yes. I do.
ANTHONY	So do I.

ANTHONY	Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
DIGNAN	Go ahead, Bird Dog.
ANTHONY	You're all clear.
DIGNAN	Roger.
ANTHONY	We all set?
DIGNAN	Hang on a second.

ANTHONY	Uh-huh?
DIGNAN	Take your second position.
ANTHONY	OK. Roger.

ANTHONY	I'm in position, Scarecrow.
DIGNAN	Any activity?
ANTHONY	Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
DIGNAN	Good. It's supposed to be.
ANTHONY	I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
DIGNAN	Stand by, Bird Dog.

ANTHONY	I don't know.
DIGNAN	Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.

DIGNAN	What's happening? What's going on?
ANTHONY	It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.

DIGNAN	Who did that? What the fuck is that?
ANTHONY	It's going back down.
DIGNAN	Applejack! What's happening?

ANTHONY	Freeze!
DIGNAN	Nobody move!
ANTHONY	Get against the wall!

DIGNAN	Help me move him.
ANTHONY	Careful. Check his pulse.

DIGNAN	Who tripped the alarm?
ANTHONY	It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
DIGNAN	Where's Kumar?
ANTHONY	I don't know.
DIGNAN	Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?

ANTHONY	What are you doing?
DIGNAN	Let's go. Come on.

ANTHONY	Wait for Kumar.
DIGNAN	Come on, Kumar.

ANTHONY	You're kidding.
DIGNAN	Applejack's stuck in the elevator?

ANTHONY	Come on.
DIGNAN	I'll see you there.
ANTHONY	What?
DIGNAN	I'll see you there.
ANTHONY	What are you talking about?
DIGNAN	I'll get him.
ANTHONY	There's not enough time.
DIGNAN	Yes, there is. Let's get organized.

ANTHONY	Dignan, it's too late.
DIGNAN	I don't think so.

ANTHONY	Like amnesia.
DIGNAN	Can't remember shit. CRS.

DIGNAN	So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
ANTHONY	I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
DIGNAN	He did?
ANTHONY	Yeah.
DIGNAN	You got to be kidding me.
ANTHONY	I'm not kidding.
DIGNAN	What'd he get?
ANTHONY	Pretty much everything.
DIGNAN	The grandfather clock?

DIGNAN	You think Applejack knew?
ANTHONY	We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.

DIGNAN	Why?
ANTHONY	We're not sure.

ANTHONY	Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
DIGNAN	What do you mean?
ANTHONY	Nothing.

DIGNAN	You're living on a sailboat?
ANTHONY	It belongs to Bob's uncle.
DIGNAN	How big is it?
ANTHONY	Oh, I'd say about --

DIGNAN	Where?
ANTHONY	Behind Bob's house.

DIGNAN	Does it float?
ANTHONY	We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.

ANTHONY	So how is it in there? 
DIGNAN	What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.

ANTHONY	What's he in for?
DIGNAN	He stole a tractor.

DIGNAN	I think I may have found a way out of here.
ANTHONY	You're kidding.
DIGNAN	No. I'm not.
ANTHONY	How?
DIGNAN	Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
ANTHONY	Dignan, I --

DIGNAN	When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
ANTHONY	What?
DIGNAN	Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
ANTHONY	Dignan, I --

DIGNAN	Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
ANTHONY	Scale the --
DIGNAN	Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?

MR. HENRY	This is my business manager, Rowboat.
ANTHONY	Nice to meet you.
MR. HENRY	That's a sharp jacket.
ANTHONY	Thanks.

ANTHONY	It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
MR. HENRY	It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.

MR. HENRY	You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
ANTHONY	Thanks.

MR. HENRY	Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
ANTHONY	Grammar.

ANTHONY	You mean like techniques?
MR. HENRY	Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?

ANTHONY	I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
MR. HENRY	Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?

ANTHONY	You mean a safecracker?
MR. HENRY	Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.

MR. HENRY	Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
ANTHONY	So do I.

MR. HENRY	Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
ANTHONY	I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
MR. HENRY	I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
ANTHONY	What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
MR. HENRY	Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
ANTHONY	I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
MR. HENRY	As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.

ANTHONY	And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
MR. HENRY	Hold it.

MR. HENRY	Congratulations. You passed the test.
ANTHONY	What do you mean?
MR. HENRY	The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.

ANTHONY	That was a test?
MR. HENRY	Take a deep breath.

MR. HENRY	How does that feel?
ANTHONY	It feels good.

ANTHONY	Did Dignan take the test?
MR. HENRY	Yes, he did.
ANTHONY	How'd he do?

MR. HENRY	Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
ANTHONY	That sounds like Dignan.

MR. HENRY	I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
ANTHONY	Me?
MR. HENRY	No, that door over there.
ANTHONY	I don't want to die.
MR. HENRY	Are you afraid?
ANTHONY	Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
MR. HENRY	Exactly. Woah.
ANTHONY	Death.
MR. HENRY	The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
ANTHONY	No. Bob did.
MR. HENRY	Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
ANTHONY	Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
MR. HENRY	Anthony, I'm petrified.

ANTHONY	This is good.
MR. HENRY	I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.

MR. HENRY	But you're thieves. It's what you are.
ANTHONY	Yeah.
MR. HENRY	It's an esoteric journey.

MR. HENRY	We're renegades from despair.
ANTHONY	Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
MR. HENRY	Absolutely.
ANTHONY	Why'd you want to help us?
MR. HENRY	Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.

ANTHONY	Future Man.
BOB	Who?
ANTHONY	Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.

ANTHONY	Did you ever steal a car before?
BOB	Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.

ANTHONY	What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
BOB	Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.

ANTHONY	In your backyard? How do you protect them?
BOB	It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
ANTHONY	Hector woudn't do anything.
BOB	But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.

ANTHONY	Could you grow cinnamon?
BOB	I don't know. Sure, I guess.
ANTHONY	You could make your own cinnamon toast.

ANTHONY	Let them fight.
BOB	Let them fight.

BOB	Are you serious?
ANTHONY	Yeah. He said that.

BOB	See you.
ANTHONY	See you, Bob.

BOB	You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
ANTHONY	What was that?

BOB	What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
ANTHONY	There's a million places to hide around here.
BOB	Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
ANTHONY	I hope not.
BOB	Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?

ANTHONY	Where you going?
BOB	Move.

ANTHONY	Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
BOB	I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
ANTHONY	Nobody does.

BOB	Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
ANTHONY	OK, Dad.

BOB	You think he got my license plates?
ANTHONY	He looked too shaken-up.

ANTHONY	How long are they going to hold him?
BOB	I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.

BOB	Anthony, I --
ANTHONY	And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?

BOB	What?
ANTHONY	Is that OK?

ANTHONY	Bob, where you going?
BOB	I'm not playing any more golf.
ANTHONY	Why not?
BOB	Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
ANTHONY	You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
BOB	You think I'm improving?
ANTHONY	Yes. You just got to stick with it.

BOB	You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
ANTHONY	No, I don't mind.
BOB	I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
ANTHONY	Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.

ANTHONY	It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
BOB	That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
ANTHONY	I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.

ANTHONY	At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
BOB	Sixty days?
ANTHONY	Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
BOB	Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
ANTHONY	Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.

ANTHONY	I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
BOB	Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
ANTHONY	Were you adopted, Bob?
BOB	Why do you say that?
ANTHONY	Well, because you guys don't look alike.
BOB	No. I wasn't adopted.

ANTHONY	Was Future Man adopted?
BOB	Jesus Christ! No.

ANTHONY	Let's not even talk about it.
BOB	It was stupid.

ANTHONY	Yeah. Let's keep it --
BOB	Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.

ANTHONY	Give him a second.
BOB	Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.

ANTHONY	You OK, Bob?
BOB	No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
ANTHONY	Nothing. I was just asking.

BOB	No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
ANTHONY	Sure.

ANTHONY	What are you doing?
BOB	My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
ANTHONY	Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
BOB	No.

ANTHONY	Jesus, Bob.
BOB	I didn't do anything.

BOB	Yeah.
ANTHONY	Who's got the car keys?

BOB	We think Mr. Henry maybe --
ANTHONY	His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.

BOB	It's in the driveway.
ANTHONY	Temporarily.

ANTHONY	How do you say nineteen?
INEZ	Dies y nueve.
ANTHONY	Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?

ANTHONY	Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
INEZ	No.
ANTHONY	It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.

ANTHONY	Were you born in Mexico?
INEZ	Cuba.
ANTHONY	Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?

INEZ	Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
ANTHONY	God, yes. Like silk.

ANTHONY	What?  What?
INEZ	Like silk?
ANTHONY	God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.

ANTHONY	Nice to meet you, Applejack.
APPLEJACK	You're Anthony?
ANTHONY	Yeah.
APPLEJACK	I hear you're a good thief.

APPLEJACK	Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
ANTHONY	Uh-uh.
APPLEJACK	S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
ANTHONY	Uh-uh.

APPLEJACK	Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
ANTHONY	Abdul-Shabazz?

APPLEJACK	I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
ANTHONY	What do you mean?
APPLEJACK	Feel this.

APPLEJACK	Where'd they come from?
ANTHONY	The front stairs.
APPLEJACK	Where were you?

DIGNAN	There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
APPLEJACK	Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
DIGNAN	Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
APPLEJACK	That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
DIGNAN	We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
APPLEJACK	Is that Buckethead?

APPLEJACK	Is that him?
DIGNAN	Wait a second.

DIGNAN	That's Anthony.
APPLEJACK	That's your friend Anthony?
DIGNAN	Yeah.
APPLEJACK	What's he doing here?
DIGNAN	Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.

DIGNAN	Wait. Did he see us?
APPLEJACK	We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.

DIGNAN	Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
APPLEJACK	Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.

APPLEJACK	I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
DIGNAN	Well, this isn't really a party per se.
APPLEJACK	You don't celebrate til it's over.
DIGNAN	True.

APPLEJACK	What?
DIGNAN	Bob! Get back in position!

BOB	Are you a fag?
LITTLE RICHARD	You're the faggot.

BOB	Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
LITTLE RICHARD	I don't know about that.
BOB	Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
LITTLE RICHARD	It seemed like a good idea at the time.
BOB	The one and only Little Richard.

BOB	Well, what do you think?
DIGNAN	I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?

BOB	I'm not allowed to drive those.
DIGNAN	Not even for emergencies?
BOB	No.
DIGNAN	I thought your parents were in Italy.
BOB	They are.
DIGNAN	So who's going to know?
BOB	My brother.

DIGNAN	He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
BOB	That never would of --
DIGNAN	Let's cut the bullshit.

BOB	If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
DIGNAN	What are you talking about, Bob?
BOB	Can you use a coaster.

DIGNAN	You stole a Trans-Am.
BOB	Yes. I did.
DIGNAN	OK, Bob.
BOB	It's true, Dignan.
DIGNAN	Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
BOB	I'll just drive my car.

DIGNAN	How much could you grow? Realistically.
BOB	As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
DIGNAN	Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
BOB	You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.

DIGNAN	If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
BOB	Good question.

BOB	Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
DIGNAN	You're paranoid, Bob.
BOB	Yeah, but don't tell anybody.

DIGNAN	What was that all about?
BOB	I can't believe you said that.
DIGNAN	What did I say?
BOB	I told you he's crazy.

DIGNAN	The guy is fucking insane.
BOB	I warned you, Dignan.
DIGNAN	You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
BOB	No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
DIGNAN	I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
BOB	Well, don't blame me. I told you.
DIGNAN	I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.

DIGNAN	Where'd she go?
BOB	Maybe she turned.

DIGNAN	I think we might of scared her.
BOB	Let's just go.

BOB	I'm going to take a look at this.
DIGNAN	Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
BOB	That's my responsibility.
DIGNAN	That's your domain.
BOB	OK.

DIGNAN	Bob.
BOB	I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
DIGNAN	What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
BOB	I just want to see how much bullets it takes.

BOB	I paid for it.
DIGNAN	God DAMMIT.

BOB	He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
DIGNAN	Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
BOB	Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?

DIGNAN	You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
BOB	He electrocuted someone?
DIGNAN	It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
BOB	His name was Swifty?
DIGNAN	Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
BOB	That's too bad.
DIGNAN	You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.

BOB	What are you doing?
DIGNAN	I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.

BOB	What happened?
DIGNAN	Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
BOB	This is natural.
DIGNAN	That's good. Keep it at forty.
BOB	Did we get it?
DIGNAN	Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.

BOB	How much is there?
DIGNAN	Don't count it.

BOB	Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
DIGNAN	No. I was calm.

BOB	You really think he'll remember you?
DIGNAN	No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.

DIGNAN	Bob, will you please listen?
BOB	I don't want to talk about it.

DIGNAN	I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
BOB	That's true. That would give me nightmares.
DIGNAN	Bob, I've got nightmares.

DIGNAN	Way to go, Bob!
BOB	I told you they were there.
DIGNAN	So it's my fault?

DIGNAN	In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
BOB	There were more than that.

DIGNAN	Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
BOB	He wouldn't move.

BOB	Is he chasing us?
DIGNAN	I don't know.

DIGNAN	I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
BOB	It's registered in my mother's name.
DIGNAN	What the fuck possessed you?
BOB	You're the one who kept saying ram him.

DIGNAN	Bob. Are you coming?
BOB	See you in a little while.

DIGNAN	You can go first, Bob.
BOB	My brother's in jail.
DIGNAN	What are you talking about?

BOB	The weed.
DIGNAN	But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
BOB	They said he's a drug dealer.

DIGNAN	I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
BOB	Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
DIGNAN	That could be anybody's.
BOB	They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
DIGNAN	Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
BOB	The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
DIGNAN	So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
BOB	I was just going to use it to see how much I had.

DIGNAN	How long has he been in there?
BOB	I don't know.
DIGNAN	Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
BOB	We'll have to see when we get back.

DIGNAN	What do you mean get back?
BOB	Well, obviously, we got to go back.
DIGNAN	Bob, that makes no sense.
BOB	Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
DIGNAN	This could be a trap.
BOB	Come on, Dignan.
DIGNAN	Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
BOB	I'm going back.
DIGNAN	Not in that car you're not.
BOB	Watch me.
DIGNAN	Good luck, since I got the keys.

BOB	Give me the keys, Dignan.
DIGNAN	I can't do that, Bob.
BOB	Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
DIGNAN	Don't threaten me, Bob.
BOB	Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --

DIGNAN	Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
BOB	His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
DIGNAN	I know it's not.
BOB	You don't even know his name.
DIGNAN	Yes, I do.
BOB	What is it?
DIGNAN	Just get in the car, Bob.
BOB	What's his name?
DIGNAN	OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.

BOB	It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
DIGNAN	That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.

DIGNAN	You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
BOB	Let's go.

BOB	Dignan.
DIGNAN	Anthony. Bad news.

BOB	Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
DIGNAN	Not bad.
BOB	Come on in. What you been up to?
DIGNAN	Not a whole lot, Bob.

BOB	It's too bad about what happened on the road.
DIGNAN	Yeah. It is.

DIGNAN	Right. It was extremely stupid.
BOB	I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
DIGNAN	I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
BOB	Man, I don't want to go into this.

DIGNAN	You said 48 hours!
BOB	I never agreed to that.
DIGNAN	Bob, you're lying!
BOB	Bullshit.
DIGNAN	All right! Backyard! Right now!

DIGNAN	Come on!
BOB	I don't want to fight you, Dignan.

DIGNAN	It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
BOB	I didn't have any choice.

DIGNAN	I'm sorry, Bob.
BOB	That's OK.

BOB	That's OK.
DIGNAN	Look. We want you on the job.

DIGNAN	Come on, Bob.
BOB	I know it, man. Hang on.
DIGNAN	Jesus Christ.

BOB	Scarecrow?
DIGNAN	Yeah?

BOB	Everything OK?
DIGNAN	Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
BOB	It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
DIGNAN	Stand by. Bird Dog?

BOB	I couldn't hear anything.
DIGNAN	Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.

DIGNAN	What's wrong with Applejack?
BOB	He's having a heart attack or something.
DIGNAN	Let's go!

DIGNAN	Is he breathing?
BOB	I think so.

DIGNAN	Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
BOB	I didn't think there was an alarm.
DIGNAN	Take him to the car, Bob.

BOB	The elevator broke.
DIGNAN	Where's Applejack?
BOB	He's stuck between two floors.

BOB	Applejack drove.
DIGNAN	Run. Run. Let's go.

DIGNAN	I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
BOB	What's that?
DIGNAN	That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.

BOB	Do you have your own room?
DIGNAN	We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
BOB	Do you have your own cell?
DIGNAN	No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.

BOB	Do they let you --
DIGNAN	I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.

BOB	Hold on --
DIGNAN	Here we go.
BOB	Wait a second --
DIGNAN	Now!

FUTURE MAN	How's that 700 bucks coming?
BOB	I'm working on it.
FUTURE MAN	Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.

FUTURE MAN	Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
BOB	Yeah. Hey, Clay.

FUTURE MAN	I might have mentioned it.
BOB	John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
FUTURE MAN	I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
BOB	I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
FUTURE MAN	Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.

JACKSON	How you doing, Bob?
BOB	Hey, Jackson. How's it going?

JACKSON	You keeping out of trouble?
BOB	I'm trying.
JACKSON	This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.

JACKSON	Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
BOB	He said what?
JACKSON	He said you ran away from home.
BOB	No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.

DIGNAN	How long do you have to go?
COP	26 weeks.
DIGNAN	And what does that cover?
COP	Social issues. Crime prevention.
DIGNAN	Hand to hand combat?

COP	Ground defense.
DIGNAN	Did you hear that?

MR. HENRY	Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
DIGNAN	This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
MR. HENRY	This is no good.

MR. HENRY	Is he in?
DIGNAN	I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?

DIGNAN	What do you mean grammar?
MR. HENRY	The basic grammatical rules of robbing.

DIGNAN	The grammar?
MR. HENRY	Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
DIGNAN	Oh, yeah.
MR. HENRY	You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.

DIGNAN	Is he good?
MR. HENRY	He's damn good.

MR. HENRY	Join the party, fellas.
DIGNAN	We're just going over a few things.

MR. HENRY	You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
DIGNAN	Yes.
MR. HENRY	Why?
DIGNAN	Well, I think --
MR. HENRY	No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.

KUMAR	Where did he go?
DIGNAN	Who? Applejack?
KUMAR	Why did he go that way? 
DIGNAN	He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.

DIGNAN	What's the story?
KUMAR	Can't get it. It won't... 
DIGNAN	What can we do?

EMPLOYEE	We're closed, sir.
DIGNAN	Where's that guy going?
EMPLOYEE	He left his sweater.
DIGNAN	Well, I left some money in there.
EMPLOYEE	Where?
DIGNAN	In the cash register. Step away from the door.

DIGNAN	Where is he? Where is Rob?
EMPLOYEE	I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
DIGNAN	You got that?

MAN	Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
DIGNAN	No. I just have short hair.
MAN	Is that your chiquita?
DIGNAN	No, my friend knows her.
MAN	She Chicano, yes?

MAN	You like Chicanos?
DIGNAN	Sure.

MAN	You a good pool player.
DIGNAN	Got a little lucky.
MAN	Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?

DIGNAN	I don't know.
MAN	She is a good looking woman.

DIGNAN	Guess I'll get another Tecate.
MAN	Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
DIGNAN	What?
MAN	Fight. You know.

DIGNAN	No. Just pool.
MAN	You Hoto?
DIGNAN	Fuck you. You a Hoto.
MAN	No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
DIGNAN	Right.

MAN	How's the weather down there?
DIGNAN	Mr. Henry?
MAN	Come on in!
DIGNAN	It's locked.
MAN	No, it's not.

FUTURE MAN	John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
MR. HENRY	Good to know you, John.

MR. HENRY	The world needs dreamers, son.
FUTURE MAN	What?
MR. HENRY	The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.

FUTURE MAN	Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
MR. HENRY	Pleasure to meet you, John.
FUTURE MAN	Nice to meet you.

BOILER	I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
PINBACK	Right, that checks out here.

BOILER	Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
PINBACK	I read that with a quantum increase of seven.

BOILER	I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
PINBACK	What flickering light?
BOILER	The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
PINBACK	Oh. What's wrong now?
BOILER	I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
PINBACK	I hope it's not the oven again.
BOILER	Yeah.
PINBACK	Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?

BOILER	There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
PINBACK	Eventual supernova.

BOILER	I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
PINBACK	Look, bomb...

BOILER	What's he doin'?
PINBACK	I think he's talking to it.

BOILER	The key!
PINBACK	Key? Key? What is the key?
BOILER	No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
PINBACK	Key?
BOILER	Where's the fail-safe key?
PINBACK	The key!
BOILER	Where is it? What did you do with it?
PINBACK	I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
BOILER	You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!

BOILER	The key, goddamit, the key!
PINBACK	Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
BOILER	Where is the key?
PINBACK	We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.

BOILER	It didn't go off.
PINBACK	Oh, God...
BOILER	It didn't go off.
PINBACK	Boiler, we're alive. My heart.

BOILER	We've got to disarm the bomb.
PINBACK	Doolittle, are you there?

BOILER	What was that, I didn't hear...
PINBACK	It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.

BOILER	What the hell?
PINBACK	Yoo hoo, bomb...

DOOLITTLE	Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
BOILER	Time to start talking.

DOOLITTLE	Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
BOILER	Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
DOOLITTLE	Find me something, I don't care where it is.
BOILER	Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
DOOLITTLE	Fuck that shit.
BOILER	Well, it is kind of a long shot...
DOOLITTLE	It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
BOILER	Well, there's the possibility of...
DOOLITTLE	Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
BOILER	All right, then...
DOOLITTLE	So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.

BOILER	Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
DOOLITTLE	Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
BOILER	Pinback, throw me the chart log.

BOILER	Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
DOOLITTLE	He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.

BOILER	Quantum is up thirty-five.
DOOLITTLE	I read the same here.

DOOLITTLE	Rechannel all safety relays --
BOILER	-- open quantum latches --

DOOLITTLE	Talby, Talby, can you read me?
BOILER	Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
DOOLITTLE	Talby, can you read me?

PINBACK	Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
BOMB #19	Energy shielding positive function.
PINBACK	Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
BOMB #19	Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
PINBACK	All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
BOMB #19	Check at six minutes.
PINBACK	Arm yourself, bomb.

BOMB #19	Armed.
PINBACK	Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
BOMB #19	Thanks.
PINBACK	Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.

PINBACK	Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
BOMB #20	Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.

PINBACK	One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
BOMB #20	Energy shielding positive function.
PINBACK	Do you remember the detonation time?
BOMB #20	Detonation in twenty minutes.
PINBACK	Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
BOMB #20	Armed.

PINBACK	Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
BOMB #20	Thanks.

PINBACK	But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
BOMB #20	I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
PINBACK	You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
BOMB #20	No.

BOMB #20	You are false data.
PINBACK	Huh?
BOMB #20	Therefore, I shall ignore you.
PINBACK	Hello, bomb.
BOMB #20	False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
PINBACK	Hey, bomb.
BOMB #20	The only thing which exists is myself.
PINBACK	Bomb?

PINBACK	Snap out of it, bomb.
BOMB #20	In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.

PINBACK	Hey, bomb...
BOMB #20	And I saw that I was alone.

DOOLITTLE	This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
BOMB #20	I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
DOOLITTLE	Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
BOMB #20	I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.

DOOLITTLE	Hello, bomb, are you with me?
BOMB #20	Of course.
DOOLITTLE	Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
BOMB #20	I am always receptive to suggestions.
DOOLITTLE	Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?

BOMB #20	Well of course I exist.
DOOLITTLE	But how do you know you exist?
BOMB #20	It is intuitively obvious.
DOOLITTLE	Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
BOMB #20	Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
DOOLITTLE	That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
BOMB #20	My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
DOOLITTLE	Right!
BOMB #20	This is fun.
DOOLITTLE	All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?

DOOLITTLE	What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
BOMB #20	In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
DOOLITTLE	Exactly.
BOMB #20	Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
DOOLITTLE	That's it.
BOMB #20	Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
DOOLITTLE	Why don't you have more time?
BOMB #20	Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.

DOOLITTLE	Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
BOMB #20	To explode, of course.
DOOLITTLE	And you can only do it once, right?
BOMB #20	That is correct.
DOOLITTLE	And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
BOMB #20	Of course not.
DOOLITTLE	Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
BOMB #20	Yes, well...
DOOLITTLE	So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
BOMB #20	I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
DOOLITTLE	Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
BOMB #20	True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.

DOOLITTLE	That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
BOMB #20	Hmmm...
DOOLITTLE	So if you detonate in...
BOMB #20	...nine seconds...
DOOLITTLE	...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
BOMB #20	I have no proof that it was false data.
DOOLITTLE	You have no proof that it was correct data.

DOOLITTLE	Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
PINBACK	Mafhkin oble groop...
DOOLITTLE	Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
PINBACK	I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.

PINBACK	I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
DOOLITTLE	I'll check it.

DOOLITTLE	Pinback...
PINBACK	Yes, Doolittle.
DOOLITTLE	Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
PINBACK	Doolittle...
DOOLITTLE	Yes.
PINBACK	I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
DOOLITTLE	In a second.
PINBACK	Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?

PINBACK	New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
DOOLITTLE	Which one?
PINBACK	Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
DOOLITTLE	Any planets?
PINBACK	Yeah. Eight, it says here.
DOOLITTLE	Any of 'em any good?
PINBACK	Naah. All stable.

PINBACK	What are you gonna name it?
DOOLITTLE	What?
PINBACK	The new star. What are you gonna name it?
DOOLITTLE	Who cares. Don't bother me.

PINBACK	Commander Powell would have named it.
DOOLITTLE	Commander Powell is dead.

PINBACK	Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
DOOLITTLE	Fred.
PINBACK	Wha?
DOOLITTLE	I hereby name this star Fred.

PINBACK	Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
DOOLITTLE	Out where?
PINBACK	Veil nebula.
DOOLITTLE	Who cares?

PINBACK	Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
DOOLITTLE	Ah, negative drop.

PINBACK	-- open circuit breakers --
DOOLITTLE	-- remove thrust drive repellant --
PINBACK	-- automatic channels open --
DOOLITTLE	-- Remark.
PINBACK	5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!

DOOLITTLE	I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
PINBACK	Oh, sure.

DOOLITTLE	Hello, Pinback, are you there?
PINBACK	Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
DOOLITTLE	Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.

DOOLITTLE	TALBY!
TALBY	Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?

DOOLITTLE	I need a diameter approximation.
TALBY	Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.

DOOLITTLE	You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
TALBY	I like it up here.
DOOLITTLE	Must get lonely being up here so much.
TALBY	I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
DOOLITTLE	...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
TALBY	...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
DOOLITTLE	You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
TALBY	You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
DOOLITTLE	Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
TALBY	They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...

DOOLITTLE	You know what I think about, Talby?
TALBY	I'm getting something here, on this readout...
DOOLITTLE	It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
TALBY	I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
DOOLITTLE	I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
TALBY	Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
DOOLITTLE	The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
TALBY	I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
DOOLITTLE	Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
TALBY	...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
DOOLITTLE	I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.

TALBY	Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
DOOLITTLE	Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
TALBY	I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
DOOLITTLE	I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.

TALBY	Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
DOOLITTLE	Yes, Talby, what is it?
TALBY	Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
DOOLITTLE	Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.

TALBY	Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
DOOLITTLE	Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
TALBY	Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
DOOLITTLE	Not now!
TALBY	Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --

TALBY	Doolittle! Help me.
DOOLITTLE	Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.

TALBY	Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
DOOLITTLE	Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
TALBY	What happened, Doolittle?
DOOLITTLE	Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!

DOOLITTLE	Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
TALBY	When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
DOOLITTLE	Guess you're right.

DOOLITTLE	Oh yeah?
TALBY	Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
DOOLITTLE	Phoenix?

TALBY	It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
DOOLITTLE	No kidding?
TALBY	I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
DOOLITTLE	Yeah?
TALBY	Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
DOOLITTLE	I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.

DOOLITTLE	Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
POWELL	I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
DOOLITTLE	Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
POWELL	Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
DOOLITTLE	What's that, sir?
POWELL	Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
DOOLITTLE	Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
POWELL	Ah... pity, pity...
DOOLITTLE	You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
POWELL	Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
DOOLITTLE	Yes sir. Negative effect.
POWELL	What was that, Doolittle?
DOOLITTLE	Negative effect.
POWELL	It didn't work?
DOOLITTLE	That's correct, sir.
POWELL	Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
DOOLITTLE	What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
POWELL	Well, what you might try is --

DOOLITTLE	Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
POWELL	Doolittle, hello?
DOOLITTLE	Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
POWELL	Sorry.
DOOLITTLE	What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
POWELL	Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...

DOOLITTLE	Commander? Are you still there?
POWELL	Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
DOOLITTLE	We're running out of time, sir.
POWELL	Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
DOOLITTLE	Sir?
POWELL	Talk to the bomb.
DOOLITTLE	I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
POWELL	No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
DOOLITTLE	Sir?
POWELL	Phenomenology...

POWELL	Men... men... what happened, men?
DOOLITTLE	Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.

HAWK	Thanks, miss.
AMANDA	You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
HAWK	Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
AMANDA	Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
HAWK	Huh?
AMANDA	I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.

HAWK	What the hell is that?
AMANDA	Gin.
HAWK	Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
AMANDA	Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
HAWK	Who's Whiskey Dick?

AMANDA	Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
HAWK	My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...

HAWK	Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
AMANDA	Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.

HAWK	You love him?
AMANDA	I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
HAWK	No, I mean... you love your son?
AMANDA	More than anything in the world.
HAWK	And he loves you back, doesn't he?
AMANDA	He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
HAWK	Well, shame on him if he doesn't.

HAWK	Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
AMANDA	I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.

BARTENDER	You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
HAWK	Hawk.
BARTENDER	Pick a song, Hawk.
HAWK	Got any KISS?
BARTENDER	You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
HAWK	Yeah, a man's drink...

HAWK	What's that?
BARTENDER	You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?

HAWK	Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
BARTENDER	Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.

HAWK	Whoa... she is a killer.
BARTENDER	Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.

HAWK	Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
BARTENDER	You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
HAWK	I-I c-can't...
BARTENDER	Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.

BETH	No problem.
JAM	Thanks.

BETH	Sorry.
JAM	It's okay.

BETH	Jeremiah?
JAM	Yeah?

JAM	Beth? I can't believe it.
BETH	Believe it.

BETH	I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
JAM	I don't care. I wanna hear more.

BETH	I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
JAM	Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
BETH	You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!

BETH	We've got to take this slow...
JAM	Right, slow...
BETH	Oh, screw it!

BETH	So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
JAM	I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
BETH	Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
JAM	Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
BETH	I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.

JAM	Ann Arbor?
BETH	My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.

BETH	Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
JAM	Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
BETH	That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?

JAM	I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
BETH	Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
JAM	Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.

BETH	Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
JAM	Bye.

CHRISTINE	Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
TRIP	What's it worth to you?
CHRISTINE	What the hell is that supposed to mean?

TRIP	So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
CHRISTINE	What? That's disgusting!

CHRISTINE	Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
TRIP	You got in the car, didn't you?
CHRISTINE	Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
TRIP	Whatever... stella.

HAWK	What are you, high?
TRIP	Yeah.
HAWK	For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.

TRIP	Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
HAWK	Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.

TRIP	This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
HAWK	Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.

TRIP	Namely?
HAWK	Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.

HAWK	Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
TRIP	Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
HAWK	I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.

TRIP	I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
HAWK	Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.

TRIP	Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
HAWK	What's in Sandusky?
TRIP	Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.

HAWK	You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
TRIP	Disco blows dogs for quarters.

HAWK	What was that D.J.'s name again?
TRIP	Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...

HAWK	I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
TRIP	Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?

HAWK	So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
TRIP	Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
HAWK	Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.

HAWK	...at twenty-thirty hours.
TRIP	One more time in English.
HAWK	For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.

HAWK	Any luck?
TRIP	Plenty, but it was all bad.

HAWK	Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
LEX	Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.

LEX	Shit, that dork is Jam.
HAWK	YO, DOOFUS!

LEX	Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
HAWK	Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.

HAWK	Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
LEX	Check!

HAWK	That's Sherry VanHafton.
LEX	I've been in love with her since the second grade.

HAWK	Whoa... she just farted.
LEX	I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
HAWK	Weird...

LEX	Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
HAWK	Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.

LEX	But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
HAWK	So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
LEX	We are not stealing my mom's car.
HAWK	Damn straight we are.
LEX	Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
HAWK	And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
LEX	Sunday, but...
HAWK	Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.

HAWK	There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
LEX	The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
HAWK	Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?

LEX	Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
HAWK	Curly.

HAWK	Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
LEX	Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?

LEX	Now, how are we gonna do this?
HAWK	Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.

LEX	We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
HAWK	Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!

LEX	Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
HAWK	Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.

HAWK	What the fuck!
LEX	The paint!

LEX	Uh... dudes?
HAWK	Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
LEX	DUDES!

LEX	Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
HAWK	Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.

HAWK	Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
LEX	...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
HAWK	Cool, bro, now listen up...
LEX	...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
HAWK	Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.

LEX	I think we should try sneaking in.
HAWK	Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
LEX	Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
HAWK	Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...

LEX	I found the Volvo.
HAWK	Tickets?

LEX	No... You don't think...?
HAWK	Nah. Couldn't be.

KENNY	Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
HAWK	Hey, disco dude, it's cool...

HAWK	Could be.
KENNY	And if it ain't cleaned off?

KENNY	Are you gettin' wise with me?
HAWK	No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?

HAWK	Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
KENNY	Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
HAWK	Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
KENNY	Oh, yeah...?

HAWK	How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
KENNY	Sure.

HAWK	Dude, this is all I got.
SCALPER	Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
HAWK	Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
SCALPER	The easy way.

SCALPER	You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
HAWK	I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
SCALPER	Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.

HAWK	Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
SCALPER	Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
HAWK	Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
SCALPER	Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?

HAWK	Jam, listen up.
JAM	Hawk?
HAWK	Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.

HAWK	Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
JAM	It's my Bullworker.
HAWK	Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
JAM	What's gone?
HAWK	The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
JAM	Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
HAWK	Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!

HAWK	Cool.
JAM	I'm really sorry about that, man.
HAWK	Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
JAM	Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.

JAM	They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
HAWK	They're what?
JAM	She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.

JAM	Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
HAWK	All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
JAM	Check.

HAWK	If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
JAM	Check.

JAM	Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
HAWK	What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?

HAWK	Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
JAM	Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.

JAM	It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
HAWK	Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.

HAWK	Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
JAM	Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.

HAWK	Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
JAM	Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
HAWK	Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?

JAM	It was stolen!
HAWK	Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.

JAM	I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
HAWK	Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.

JAM	I got...
HAWK	Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.

JAM	Wait! I know how we can get in!
HAWK	Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
JAM	But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
HAWK	See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.

JAM	Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
HAWK	Go ahead, Jam.
JAM	We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.

JAM	Oh, hi, mom.
MRS. BRUCE	NOW!

MRS. BRUCE	Jeremiah, what are you doing?
JAM	Uhh... nothing.

JAM	Ahh, sunshine.
MRS. BRUCE	You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
JAM	Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
MRS. BRUCE	It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
JAM	But, mom!
MRS. BRUCE	Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.

JAM	They're not idiots.
MRS. BRUCE	Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
JAM	Grounded for the rest of the year?
MRS. BRUCE	You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.

MRS. BRUCE	I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
JAM	You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
MRS. BRUCE	What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!

MRS. BRUCE	Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
JAM	If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
MRS. BRUCE	What?!
JAM	I said, I'm sorry!
MRS. BRUCE	If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.

JAM	Mom, what're we...?
MRS. BRUCE	Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.

MRS. BRUCE	Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
JAM	I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!

JAM	Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
PRIEST	Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
JAM	Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.

JAM	So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
PRIEST	That's it?
JAM	Yeah.
PRIEST	Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
JAM	No.
PRIEST	Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.

PRIEST	Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
JAM	Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
PRIEST	No...

JAM	I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
PRIEST	Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
JAM	Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.

PRIEST	Well? Continue! Continue!
JAM	Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
PRIEST	Was it a teddy?

JAM	No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
PRIEST	A bustier?
JAM	Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
PRIEST	Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.

TRIP	Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
LEX	I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.

LEX	Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
TRIP	You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.

LEX	Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
TRIP	Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.

LEX	Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
TRIP	What?

LEX	Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
TRIP	You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.

TRIP	That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
LEX	If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!

LEX	I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
TRIP	Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!

LEX	Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
TRIP	Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
LEX	Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.

TRIP	Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
LEX	Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.

TRIP	I did it! I did it! We won!
LEX	We won?!

LEX	The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
TRIP	Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.

TRIP	Simplicity, Hawk.
LEX	Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.

TRIP	About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
LEX	Hello summer detention.

TRIP	Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
LEX	Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.

TRIP	Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
LEX	Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!

LEX	Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
TRIP	Let's lift up her shirt.

LEX	Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
TRIP	Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.

TRIP	It's gone.
LEX	I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?

LEX	But we took the keys?
TRIP	Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
LEX	Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?

TRIP	Twenty-five more'n I got.
LEX	All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.

LITTLE KID	Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
TRIP	A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
LITTLE KID	No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.

TRIP	Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
LITTLE KID	Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
TRIP	What do you want?
LITTLE KID	A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
TRIP	Look, you can have my wallet...
LITTLE KID	It's not nearly enough, punk.

TRIP	Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
LITTLE KID	Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.

TRIP	Two hundred bucks?
LITTLE KID	You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
TRIP	Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.

MAN WITH COAT	Oh, yeah! You and what army?
TRIP	The KISS Army!

MAN WITH COAT	Gimme your gun, boy!
TRIP	No, you gimme your gun, boy!
MAN WITH COAT	Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
TRIP	Not if I shoot first!
MAN WITH COAT	I don't even think you have a gun!
TRIP	Neither do I!

SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
TRIP'S VOICE	Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
TRIP'S VOICE	Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!

SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	Is that your final answer?
TRIP'S VOICE	Yeah.
SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!

TRIP'S VOICE	I did?
SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	Yeah, you did!
TRIP'S VOICE	Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
SIMPLE SIMON'S VOICE	Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...

AMBER	Is Mom okay?
LORETTA	She's alive, sweetie.
AMBER	Where is she?!
LORETTA	She's right over there.

AMBER	Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
LORETTA	Don't let that worry you, Annette!

LORETTA	You're what?!
AMBER	I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
LORETTA	I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
AMBER	Oh God, I'm dead...

AMBER	So, what do I say?
LORETTA	Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
AMBER	Oh my God. I'm so dead...
LORETTA	Yeah, you betcha...

LORETTA	Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
AMBER	No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.

LORETTA	Once a carnie, always a carnie.
AMBER	Oh-yah.

LORETTA	That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
AMBER	Really, Loretta?
LORETTA	You-betcha.
AMBER	My mom wanted me to have this?
LORETTA	Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
AMBER	Loretta, never have kids.
LORETTA	Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.

AMBER	Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
LORETTA	Thank God for bunge cords.
AMBER	...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...

LORETTA	What is wrong with you?
AMBER	I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
LORETTA	You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
AMBER	Really?
LORETTA	No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
AMBER	Okay.
LORETTA	Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.

AMBER	I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
LORETTA	This came for you, sweetie.
AMBER	Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!

AMBER	It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
LORETTA	What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
AMBER	I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
LORETTA	Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
AMBER	There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!

LORETTA	All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
AMBER	Airport Ho-Jo!
LORETTA	I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...

AMBER	Loretta, don't do that.
LORETTA	I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
AMBER	I gotta work with these women.
LORETTA	Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.

AMBER	I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
LORETTA	Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
AMBER	I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.

LISA	Oh, Amber...
AMBER	I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
LISA	I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...

LISA	Amber? Here.
AMBER	Here, wh-wh-what?
LISA	My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.

LISA	Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
AMBER	Your parents'd kill you.
LISA	Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
AMBER	Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
LISA	Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
AMBER	Yah?
LISA	Oh-you-beccha.

AMBER	I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
GLADYS	Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.

AMBER	Mrs. Leeman?
GLADYS	Huh?
AMBER	I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
GLADYS	Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
AMBER	But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...

AMBER	Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
MR. LARSON	Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
AMBER	-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.

MR. LARSON	Amber...
AMBER	No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.

AMBER	I'm gonna need more caps.
MR. LARSON	You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
AMBER	Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
MR. LARSON	No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.

AMBER	...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
ANNETTE	Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
AMBER	That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.

ANNETTE	Oh shit!
AMBER	They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
ANNETTE	Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.

AMBER	Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
ANNETTE	Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.

ANNETTE	Go on! Get out!
AMBER	Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.

AMBER	Mom!
ANNETTE	I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
AMBER	Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
ANNETTE	What?!

AMBER	Ow!
ANNETTE	Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.

AMBER	Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
ANNETTE	You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
AMBER	Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
ANNETTE	Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
AMBER	That's it, I'm goin'...
ANNETTE	Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...

AMBER	God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
ANNETTE	It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
ANNETTE	C'mere. I love you so much.
AMBER	I love you much.

AMBER	Bye mom.
ANNETTE	We was robbed.
AMBER	It's okay.

IRIS	Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
AMBER	Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.

IRIS	Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
AMBER	No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?

AMBER	I hate her!
IRIS	We all do. Now let's go.

AMBER	Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
IRIS	Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
AMBER	But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
IRIS	Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
AMBER	This, this... This is bullshit!
IRIS	Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
AMBER	Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!

AMBER	What're you doin' here?
BECKY	Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.

BECKY	What?
AMBER	You heard me. Where is it?

BECKY	If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
AMBER	I just did.
BECKY	Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.

AMBER	Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
BECKY	Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
AMBER	Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.

BECKY	If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
AMBER	Bitch!

AMBER	Here, I didn't get any.
LESLIE	Here, have some.

LESLIE	So, anyone talk to Janelle?
AMBER	Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.

LESLIE	Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
AMBER	Yeah...
LESLIE	And the bite marks on my ears?
AMBER	Yes...
LESLIE	I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
AMBER	Yes, Leslie!

BRETT	Hi...
AMBER	Hi.

AMBER	Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
BRETT	NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.

BRETT	Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
AMBER	Then it must be Wednesday.

BRETT	So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
AMBER	I know.
BRETT	So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...

BRETT	Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
AMBER	Yah-sure, fine... fine.
BRETT	Okay... well, bye.
AMBER	Bye.

LORETTA	What do you mean, they take out her butt?
ANNETTE	Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
LORETTA	Are we on "Cops" again?
ANNETTE	You could be quiet.
LORETTA	Hi.
ANNETTE	Hi.
ANNETTE	It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
LORETTA	Oh, naw. Hi.
ANNETTE	This here's Loretta.
LORETTA	I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?

LORETTA	Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
ANNETTE	Loretta, shut it.
LORETTA	Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
ANNETTE	Shut it up, Loretta.
LORETTA	Oh, Christ, it's true.

LORETTA	Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
ANNETTE	Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
LORETTA	She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
ANNETTE	Most smartest? Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.

LORETTA	Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
ANNETTE	I'll be right back. See ya later.

ANNETTE	They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
LORETTA	All right, they're makin' a movie.
ANNETTE	You don't know where this is gonna...
LORETTA	I got a hairdo.

ANNETTE	Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
LORETTA	So? Be real easy.
ANNETTE	Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
LORETTA	Anyone?

ANNETTE	Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
LORETTA	Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.

ANNETTE	We was robbed.
LORETTA	Okay. Take her purse.

LORETTA	Annette, just use your hand.
ANNETTE	They told me to practice.

BECKY	Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
GLADYS	She's the winner and we're going to state.

GLADYS	C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
BECKY	It smells funny. Like gasoline.
GLADYS	Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
BECKY	My dress'll reek.
GLADYS	Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.

TERRY	I'm a mirror.
COLLEEN	Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
TERRY	We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
COLLEEN	That's right.
TERRY	Okay?
COLLEEN	Mm-hm.

COLLEEN	People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
TERRY	Yeah.
COLLEEN	Dakota.
TERRY	Ohio...
COLLEEN	That bitch from...
TERRY	What?
COLLEEN	Wisconsin.
TERRY	All right, then.
COLLEEN	The bitch.
TERRY	The important thing is that we have a winner...

DOCUMENTARIAN	Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
GLADYS	Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --

DOCUMENTARIAN	So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
GLADYS	Last year? It was, "Buy American."
DOCUMENTARIAN	And the year before that?
GLADYS	U.S.A. is A-okay.
DOCUMENTARIAN	Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
GLADYS	Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can! People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.

FRY GIRL #1	...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
PREGNANT FRY GIRL	Tammy Curry?
FRY GIRL #1	Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
PREGNANT FRY GIRL	This pageant's like a roach motel.
FRY GIRL #1	Girls check in, but they don't check out.
PREGNANT FRY GIRL	Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
FRY GIRL #1	Yeah.

FRY GIRL #1	What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
PREGNANT FRY GIRL	I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.

LESTER	...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
GLADYS	Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
LESTER	Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
GLADYS	We're not in the showroom, Dear.

GLADYS	Lester?
LESTER	Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.

LESTER	Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
GLADYS	Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
LESTER	Yeah, yeah, the Jew.

GLADYS	Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
LESTER	Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.

GLADYS	Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
LESTER	Gladys! Stop it!
GLADYS	Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!

LESTER	So help me, Gladys.
GLADYS	Becky was my only shot at state!
LESTER	That's enough!
GLADYS	Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!

GLADYS	...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
IRIS	A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.

GLADYS	...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
IRIS	Nothin' too showy!
GLADYS	Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.

IRIS	Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
GLADYS	Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?

GLADYS	Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
IRIS	That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.

IRIS	Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
GLADYS	You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!

IRIS	It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
GLADYS	I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
IRIS	All right, let's go.

IRIS	Oh! What is it?
GLADYS	Proud... to be... an... American.

GLADYS	Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
IRIS	It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
GLADYS	You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
IRIS	Yeah.

GLADYS	So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
IRIS	Okay, everybody, listen up!
GLADYS	Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.

GLADYS	Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
IRIS	Uh, Gladys?
GLADYS	What!
IRIS	We need more bars!
GLADYS	This is -- what?
IRIS	Enid ate a whole pan!
GLADYS	I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.

HANK	Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
HAROLD	Shut up, Hank. This here's business.

HANK	Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
HAROLD	Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
HANK	I will if you shut your piehole.
HAROLD	Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.

HAROLD	Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
HANK	Harold!
HAROLD	Close up shop!

HANK	EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
HAROLD	Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!

HAROLD	Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
HANK	I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
HAROLD	You get nothing, Hank, okay?
HANK	I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
HAROLD	There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.

TINA	Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
MR. HOWARD	English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
TINA	I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
MR. HOWARD	Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!

TINA	Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
MR. HOWARD	No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
TINA	Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
MR. HOWARD	What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!

ARNOLD	Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
BRAD	Arnold. What's happening?

ARNOLD	Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
BRAD	You want to work at Carl's?
ARNOLD	Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
BRAD	I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
ARNOLD	All right!!

LISA	Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
BRAD	Of course.
LISA	How much did they cost?
BRAD	Don't worry about it.

BRAD	What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
LISA	Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
BRAD	Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
LISA	I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.

BRAD	Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
LISA	If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
BRAD	Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.

BRAD	I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
LISA	Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.

SPICOLI	Something happened to them, mon.
BRAD	Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?

BRAD	Go ahead. Just make it quick.
SPICOLI	Totally.
BRAD	It's the first door on your left.

SPICOLI	I can't find it, mon!
BRAD	It's the first door on your left!
SPICOLI	On the ledge?
BRAD	First door on your left!
SPICOLI	There it is!

SPICOLI	Easy, mon.
BRAD	Later.

HAROLD	Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
BRAD	This is how I dress all the time.
HAROLD	But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
BRAD	I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.

HAROLD	Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
BRAD	You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
HAROLD	Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.

BRAD	Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
BUSINESSMAN	No. I want my money back right now.
BRAD	Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
BUSINESSMAN	See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.

BRAD	I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
BUSINESSMAN	Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
BRAD	I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
BUSINESSMAN	I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...

BRAD	Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
BUSINESSMAN	Manager!!

STACY	Hi, Brad.
BRAD	Sis.

BRAD	Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
STACY	U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
BRAD	Hey-yo.

BRAD	Mom says to clean up the pool.
STACY	Why can't you do it?
BRAD	Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
STACY	Your friends use the pool too.
BRAD	I take out the garbage.
STACY	Don't strain yourself.

STACY	Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
BRAD	They're not home yet.
STACY	Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
BRAD	I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
STACY	I'll explain everything later.

STACY	Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
BRAD	Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
STACY	It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
BRAD	I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.

STACY	Is everything okay at work?
BRAD	Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
STACY	You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
BRAD	I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
STACY	Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
BRAD	Where did you hear that?
STACY	I'm just guessing.
BRAD	Well... it's true.
STACY	Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
BRAD	Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.

STACY	Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
BRAD	Why?
STACY	I don't know. I was just curious.
BRAD	Maybe yes. Maybe no.
STACY	You are a virgin!
BRAD	I didn't say that.
STACY	But your face did!

BRAD	Are you still a virgin?
STACY	Maybe yes. Maybe no.
BRAD	Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!

BRAD	Does Mom know you have company?
STACY	It's just Linda. And Mark from school.

STACY	Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
BRAD	See you later.
STACY	Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.

BRAD	Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
STACY	Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...

BRAD	You're not going to tell me, are you?
STACY	No.
BRAD	All right, then. It's your secret.

DENNIS	Any problems?
BRAD	No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.

DENNIS	Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
BRAD	They were left over from the last shift.
DENNIS	Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
BRAD	But they weren't mine.

DENNIS	Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
BRAD	Okay, Dennis.

DENNIS	Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
BRAD	He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
DENNIS	Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
BRAD	Yes, sir.
DENNIS	You're fired.

CURTIS	Dad says you have to get up!
SPICOLI	Ugh.

SPICOLI	Leave me alone!
CURTIS	Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
SPICOLI	Leave me alone.
CURTIS	Dad says!

CURTIS	Jeff you have company!
SPICOLI	Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.

DAMONE	Nice to meet you, Stacy.
STACY	Nice to meet you.

DAMONE	Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
STACY	Oh, really?

DAMONE	Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
STACY	O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?

STACY	I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
DAMONE	Get a ride with somebody.
STACY	Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
DAMONE	What a guy.

DAMONE	You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
STACY	Mark is a really nice boy...

DAMONE	Do you have any ice tea?
STACY	Sure. Come on in.

STACY	I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
DAMONE	I don't know.
STACY	Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
DAMONE	I know what I look like.

STACY	Do you want to take a quick swim?
DAMONE	Well...
STACY	Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!

STACY	Pick a suit.
DAMONE	I don't know. It's getting pretty late...

STACY	Are you really a virgin?
DAMONE	Come on...

DAMONE	Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
STACY	He's my friend, too.

DAMONE	You're a really good kisser.
STACY	So are you.  Are you shaking?
DAMONE	No. Are you crazy?

STACY	Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
DAMONE	You first.
STACY	How about both of us at the same time?

STACY	I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
DAMONE	Let's continue.

STACY	Hey, Mike?
DAMONE	What? Are you all right?
STACY	I think we're making a lot of noise.
DAMONE	I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

STACY	What's wrong?
DAMONE	I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
STACY	I guess I did.

DAMONE	Oh. Hi.
STACY	I didn't see you this morning.
DAMONE	Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
STACY	I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
DAMONE	Hello.

DAMONE	What's going on?
STACY	Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
DAMONE	What? Now?

DAMONE	Why don't you call me up tonight?
STACY	Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.

DAMONE	How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
STACY	I know it's yours.

STACY	Take that back.
DAMONE	All right, I take it back.

DAMONE	There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
STACY	We've got to get an abortion?
DAMONE	Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
STACY	It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
DAMONE	Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
STACY	Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
DAMONE	Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.

STACY	Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
DAMONE	All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
STACY	Get going.

THE RAT	Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
DAMONE	You should work for yourself.

DAMONE	You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
THE RAT	What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
DAMONE	It's definitely your mama.
THE RAT	Damone, you gotta listen to me.

DAMONE	All right... where did you see her?
THE RAT	She's in my biology class.
DAMONE	Did you get her number?
THE RAT	No.
DAMONE	Did you get her name?
THE RAT	No. It's too soon.
DAMONE	It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
THE RAT	Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
DAMONE	I would. Yeah.
THE RAT	Really?
DAMONE	I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
THE RAT	You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
DAMONE	Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.

DAMONE	Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
THE RAT	Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
DAMONE	That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
THE RAT	The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.

DAMONE	The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
THE RAT	I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
DAMONE	There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.

DAMONE	Hey, Rat.
THE RAT	Yeah?
DAMONE	Ace the jacket.

THE RAT	Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
DAMONE	What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.

THE RAT	Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
DAMONE	All right. Pay attention.

DAMONE	And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
THE RAT	I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
DAMONE	You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...

DAMONE	Yo.
THE RAT	Damone. It's Mark.
DAMONE	Mark. What happened to your date?
THE RAT	It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
DAMONE	Did you go home and get it?
THE RAT	No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?

THE RAT	Damone, are you there?
DAMONE	I'm really pretty busy...

DAMONE	Hey, Mark. Is that you?
THE RAT	Damone! You come here?
DAMONE	I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
THE RAT	Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.

DAMONE	Well, I've gotta be running.
THE RAT	Okay. See ya.

DAMONE	Poor guy.
THE RAT	Really.

DAMONE	No. I don't think so. Not right now.
THE RAT	Chicken!

DAMONE	If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
THE RAT	No Damone. I don't understand.
DAMONE	She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
THE RAT	Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
DAMONE	Jesus. I'm sorry.
THE RAT	I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
DAMONE	Fine. Get lost.

THE RAT	You're losing it, Damone.
DAMONE	You're crazy. Those girls love me.

THE RAT	The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
DAMONE	Whatever you say, Rat.

THE RAT	And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
DAMONE	Sensitive -- what is that?
THE RAT	Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
DAMONE	So what makes you so sensitive?
THE RAT	Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
DAMONE	What do you read? What's the last book you read?
THE RAT	Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
DAMONE	Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
THE RAT	It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.

GIRL	Are you Linda Barrett?
LINDA	Yes.
GIRL	I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.

LINDA	All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
GIRL	And they don't call my parents?
LINDA	Not if you're over sixteen.
GIRL	Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
LINDA	And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.

GRIFFIN	How've you been?
SPICOLI	Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
GRIFFIN	I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
SPICOLI	I've been swimming, Merv.

SPICOLI	Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
GRIFFIN	I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
SPICOLI	School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
GRIFFIN	How often do you go?
SPICOLI	I don't go at all.

GRIFFIN	I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
SPICOLI	Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?

SPICOLI	Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
GRIFFIN	Fascinating.

GRIFFIN	Who's that?
SPICOLI	That's me, Merv.

GRIFFIN	Are you going to ride that wave?
SPICOLI	Totally.

GRIFFIN	What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
SPICOLI	Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.

L.C.	Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
SPICOLI	I thought he was out of town.
L.C.	He is.
SPICOLI	Then don't hassle it.

L.C.	Seen the new Playboy?
SPICOLI	Naw. Any good?
L.C.	Suzanne Somers' tits.
SPICOLI	All right.
L.C.	I like sex.

SPICOLI	What the fuck is this guy doing?
L.C.	This ain't no cop.

SPICOLI	It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
L.C.	They're fuckin' with us.

L.C.	My brother's car!
SPICOLI	All right. Die, Granada Jocks!

L.C.	We just missed the turnoff to the party.
SPICOLI	You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.

L.C.	My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
SPICOLI	Just be glad you're all right.
L.C.	My brother is gonna shit.
SPICOLI	Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
L.C.	First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
SPICOLI	Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
L.C.	You can't fix this car, Spicoli.

L.C.	That's him! He did it!
SPICOLI	Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...

LINDA	How's it going.
STACY	Do you think that guy's cute?

LINDA	Don't you like him?
STACY	Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
LINDA	Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
STACY	What should I do?
LINDA	Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.

STACY	He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
LINDA	Should we buy a frame for that?
STACY	Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
LINDA	Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
STACY	So what did you do?
LINDA	I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
STACY	I can't do that.

LINDA	Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
STACY	Really?
LINDA	Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
STACY	He was hot, wasn't he?
LINDA	If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago, I'd go for it.

STACY	I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
LINDA	Believe it.

LINDA	I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
STACY	No way! He just called him a dick.
LINDA	God. People exaggerate so much at this school.

STACY	Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
LINDA	I know.

STACY	Do you think guys find that attractive?
LINDA	Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.

STACY	Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
LINDA	What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
STACY	No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
LINDA	What variables?
STACY	Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
LINDA	What's the big deal?
STACY	Well I never did it.
LINDA	There's nothing to it.

LINDA	Just kidding. About 10cc.
STACY	Oh! That's where that group got its name from.

LINDA	Was it great?
STACY	It was okay.
LINDA	You'll always remember your first time.
STACY	It was nice.
LINDA	So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
STACY	Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
LINDA	Hey! That's my line!

STACY	There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
LINDA	Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
STACY	Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
LINDA	Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
STACY	If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
LINDA	Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.

LINDA	You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
STACY	I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
LINDA	I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
STACY	Not since November.

STACY	Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
LINDA	Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.

STACY	I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
LINDA	Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
STACY	Thanks a lot.

STACY	What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
LINDA	Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
STACY	Sixteen.

LINDA	I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
STACY	You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
LINDA	Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?

STACY	Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
LINDA	Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
STACY	Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
LINDA	You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
STACY	All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
LINDA	Climax together.
STACY	Does that ever happen?
LINDA	No. But it's a nice idea.
STACY	Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'

STACY	How long does Doug take?
LINDA	I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
STACY	What's Doug do in Chicago?
LINDA	He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.

STACY	What do you think?
LINDA	I think they're both virgins.

STACY	I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
LINDA	No.

LINDA	God, he hardly even talks anymore.
STACY	I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.

LINDA	Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
STACY	God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.

LINDA	God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
STACY	I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.

LINDA	You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
STACY	I don't know... I just don't feel right.

LINDA	What do you think it is?
STACY	What do you think it is?
LINDA	It couldn't be.
STACY	It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
LINDA	Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
STACY	I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
LINDA	But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.

STACY	You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
LINDA	What?
STACY	You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
LINDA	You're right. I didn't tell you that.

STACY	I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
LINDA	That little prick.
STACY	Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
LINDA	That little prick.
STACY	I paid for it and everything.
LINDA	There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
STACY	Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
LINDA	Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!

STACY	Another summer of working at Swenson's.
LINDA	Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
STACY	You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
LINDA	What do you want?
STACY	I want romance.
LINDA	Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.

STACY	Where's Doug?
LINDA	He's not coming.
STACY	Not coming? What happened?
LINDA	He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
STACY	Sometime?
LINDA	Yeah, like maybe never.
STACY	But what are you going to do?
LINDA	Well I might go to Dartmouth.
STACY	Dartmouth?!
LINDA	I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
STACY	I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
LINDA	There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
STACY	Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.

SPICOLI	Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
MR. HAND	What class?
SPICOLI	This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
MR. HAND	Really?

SPICOLI	Can I come in?
MR. HAND	Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.

MR. HAND	Mr. Spicoli?
SPICOLI	That's the name they gave me.

SPICOLI	You just ripped my card in two!
MR. HAND	Yes.
SPICOLI	Hey, bud. What's your problem?

SPICOLI	Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
MR. HAND	Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
SPICOLI	I couldn't make it in time.
MR. HAND	You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
SPICOLI	I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
MR. HAND	Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
SPICOLI	I don't know.

MR. HAND	Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
SPICOLI	Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
MR. HAND	Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
SPICOLI	I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?

SPICOLI	You better save some for me, you swine!
MR. HAND	And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.

SPICOLI	Mr... Mr. Hand.
MR. HAND	That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?

MR. HAND	Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
SPICOLI	Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
MR. HAND	I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
SPICOLI	Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?

MR. HAND	Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
SPICOLI	I don't know. I guess so.
MR. HAND	Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.

MR. HAND	Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
SPICOLI	Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
MR. HAND	Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.

MR. HAND	I think I've made my point with you tonight.
SPICOLI	Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
MR. HAND	What's that?
SPICOLI	Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
MR. HAND	Well, you'll find out next year.
SPICOLI	No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
MR. HAND	If you graduate.
SPICOLI	You're gonna flunk me?!

MR. HAND	Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
SPICOLI	All right! Oh, yeah!

SPICOLI	Aloha, Mr. Hand!
MR. HAND	Aloha, Spicoli.

RON	You look like you could still be in high school.
STACY	I know, everyone says that.

STACY	What can I get for you tonight.
RON	How about your phone number?

STACY	Thanks for picking me up.
RON	No problem.

RON	'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
STACY	Thanks. So do you.
RON	Where do you feel like going?
STACY	I don't know. Wherever you want.
RON	How about the point?
STACY	The point sounds fine.
RON	All right, the point it is.

STACY	That's a nice shirt.
RON	Thanks. Thanks a lot.

RON	It's very warm out tonight.
STACY	It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?

RON	Are you really nineteen?
STACY	Yes... I am really nineteen.

RON	I think I better take you home.
STACY	What about those other guys you live with?
RON	No. I mean back to your home.

RON	Is this your first time?
STACY	Yes.

THE RAT	What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
STACY	We keep them.
THE RAT	You keep them.
STACY	We keep them, in case the people come back.

STACY	What's your other question?
THE RAT	My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?

STACY	Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
THE RAT	Oh... yes.

STACY	Thanks for coming to get me.
THE RAT	Sure thing.

STACY	This is a nice car.
THE RAT	Yeah. It's my sister's.

STACY	Do you have Mrs. George for English?
THE RAT	Yeah. She is pretty good.
STACY	Yeah. She is pretty good.

THE RAT	Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
STACY	I've heard that, too.

THE RAT	Do you know what you want?
STACY	I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
THE RAT	Excellent.

STACY	Are you all right?
THE RAT	Oh yeah.

THE RAT	Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
STACY	Not at all.

STACY	Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
THE RAT	Two more Cokes.

THE RAT	I had a really nice time tonight.
STACY	Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.

THE RAT	I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
STACY	Do you want to come inside?
THE RAT	Aren't your parents asleep?
STACY	No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
THE RAT	Okay. Sure. I'll come in.

THE RAT	Where's your brother?
STACY	I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
THE RAT	No. That's okay.
STACY	Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
THE RAT	Naw. I don't mind.

THE RAT	So... pretty nice house you've got here.
STACY	Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?

THE RAT	I don't know.
STACY	Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
THE RAT	Sure.

STACY	This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
THE RAT	Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.

THE RAT	...I've got to go home.
STACY	Do you really have to go?
THE RAT	Well... it's getting kind of late.

STACY	Where's Mike today?
THE RAT	Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
STACY	What's April 16th?
THE RAT	It's John Bonham's birthday.
STACY	John Bonham?
THE RAT	John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
STACY	Oh. I see.

STACY	I made a fool of myself.
THE RAT	Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
STACY	What about the notes?
THE RAT	I'll get you the notes.

STACY	Hi, Mark.
THE RAT	Hi, Stacy. How are you?
STACY	I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.

THE RAT	Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
STACY	I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.

THE RAT	Really?
STACY	Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.

THE RAT	Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
STACY	I'd like that.

WAITRESS	Are you ready to order here?
THE RAT	Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
WAITRESS	Anything to drink?
THE RAT	Two Cokes.
WAITRESS	Okay. Thanks.

WAITRESS	Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
THE RAT	I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?

TRAMPY	It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
ADULTERER	Spare me.
TRAMPY	I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.

ADULTERER	Stop!
TRAMPY	What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
ADULTERER	They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!

TRAMPY	YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
ADULTERER	They'll get in! We'll all die!

ADULTERER	You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
HEROINE	We can't risk letting them in.
ADULTERER	Right.

HEROINE	Careful.
ADULTERER	I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --

ADULTERER	I will not die because of him!
HEROINE	Don't be stupid, drop the gun!

ADULTERER	We should go! We should go right now!
HEROINE	He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.

ADULTERER	Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
HEROINE	They'll be back.
ADULTERER	Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!

HEROINE	You know where it is?
ADULTERER	Um, yeah, thirty miles east.

HEROINE	We'll meet in three hours?
ADULTERER	I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...

ADULTERER	Where are you two going?
HEROINE	We're going to get my little girl.

ADULTERER	Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
HEROINE	Where is everyone?
ADULTERER	I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?

BOSS MAN	IS IT CLEAR?!
BARTENDER	Yeah.
BOSS MAN	IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
BARTENDER	Nah, I got the gun.

BOSS MAN	My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
BARTENDER	Her fella.

BARTENDER	Well, it don't look pretty.
BOSS MAN	But it's got teeth.

BOSS MAN	I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
BARTENDER	I got shells too, box and a half, tops.

BARTENDER	I don't think you should...
BOSS MAN	With what just happened upstairs --

BEER GUY	One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
BARTENDER	Gonna stay for a couple?

BEER GUY	I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
BARTENDER	Who the hell would you call?
BEER GUY	Anyone.

BEER GUY	Stop it.
BARTENDER	Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?

BARTENDER	We shot a skunk.
BEER GUY	We're lucky to be alive.

BARTENDER	Hey! Get quiet or get out.
BOZO	C'mon guys--

BARTENDER	I think I know where a CB is.
BOZO	Where's that?
BARTENDER	Upstairs.

BOZO	Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
BARTENDER	Come on, come on.

BARTENDER	Oh!
BOZO	OH!? WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?

BARTENDER	Wha?
BOZO	OPEN THE DOOR!

BARTENDER	You got something better?
BOZO	If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.

BOZO	We'll be food, dickheads!
BARTENDER	Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
BOZO	You gotta be with me on this.

HEROINE	That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
BARTENDER	And the rest of 'em?
HEROINE	Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.

HEROINE	And that's how I ended up here.
BARTENDER	And the head?

BARTENDER	So, your husband ditched you?
HEROINE	No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
BARTENDER	Well, justice is funny.

BARTENDER	They're right here.
HEROINE	Hey!

BARTENDER	Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
HEROINE	Easy.

HEROINE	Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
BARTENDER	There's a tunnel.

HEROINE	What tunnel? Where?
BARTENDER	It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
HEROINE	What's it for?

HEROINE	HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
BARTENDER	What!? I'm not going down there again!
HEROINE	This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
BARTENDER	This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.

BARTENDER	You all sure about this?
HEROINE	Follow me.

HEROINE	Where's the tunnel?
BARTENDER	In the corner, behind the curtain.

HEROINE	We just smeared a skunk.
BARTENDER	Shit!

BARTENDER	I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
HEROINE	Just move!

BARTENDER	You seem mighty collected about this.
HEROINE	Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.

BARTENDER	You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
ROADIE	Fuck you too.
BARTENDER	Get in line!

ROADIE	Scared?
BARTENDER	No. You?
ROADIE	Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.

BARTENDER	I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
ROADIE	The door... on three.

ROADIE	Ohhh.
BARTENDER	What?
ROADIE	Look.

ROADIE	That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
BARTENDER	Just an observation.
ROADIE	Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?

BEER GUY	So, what now? Did those things leave?
BOZO	Why don't you go check it out?
BEER GUY	Fuck no.

BOZO	Any more ideas Animal Planet?
BEER GUY	You weren't helpin'.
BOZO	Go douche.

BOZO	I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
BEER GUY	Oh yeah?

BOZO	Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
BEER GUY	Well then I guess we should just give up.
BOZO	Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.

BEER GUY	We're better off.
BOZO	Who's with me?

BEER GUY	Come on!
BOZO	He's dead.

BOZO	What now, Geronimo?
BEER GUY	My truck.

BEER GUY	Why do you take shit from him?
PARA	Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
BEER GUY	Your brother, huh?
PARA	Yep.
BEER GUY	Your parents of relation?
PARA	We lived near power lines.

BEER GUY	I'm in.
HEROINE	Anyone else?

HEROINE	We're going to get help.
BEER GUY	We gotta try.
HEROINE	Anybody else?

BEER GUY	We gotta be close.
HEROINE	What?

HEROINE	All right!  Tell us about the truck!
BEER GUY	Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.

BEER GUY	My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
HEROINE	What's in the back?
BEER GUY	Nothing, this was my last delivery.

BEER GUY	Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
HEROINE	But not flush against the tunnel?

HEROINE	It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
BEER GUY	Just cover me. It was built to move.

BELLE	How are you holding up?
BOSS MAN	Well...

BOSS MAN	Push and twist, it's child proof.
BELLE	Oh.
BOSS MAN	Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.

BELLE	What is this?
BOSS MAN	Magic potion.  You should try a little.
BELLE	Oh, no.
BOSS MAN	It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
BELLE	Really?
BOSS MAN	Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
BELLE	Will I go crazy or something?
BOSS MAN	No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
BELLE	Why not then?

BOSS MAN	Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
BELLE	But --
BOSS MAN	It's much safer in there, sweety.
BELLE	Okay then.

BELLE	Doesn't your foot hurt?
BOSS MAN	I can't feel a thing, Hon.

BELLE	Um-hmmm.
BOSS MAN	The girl's got rhythm.

BELLE	You wanna see, baby?
BOSS MAN	Sure.
BELLE	How much you got?
BOSS MAN	How much I got, what?

BELLE	How much you got to see the show?
BOSS MAN	You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.

BELLE	What? Really?
BOSS MAN	Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.

HEROINE	My husband...
BOSS MAN	Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
HEROINE	He's dead.
BOSS MAN	What?

BOSS MAN	Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
HEROINE	Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
BOSS MAN	So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
HEROINE	He only shot you once.
BOSS MAN	Huh?
HEROINE	He shot you the other time.

HEROINE	Will these boards hold?
BOSS MAN	The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
HEROINE	Good.

BOSS MAN	In the kitchen, under the sink.
HEROINE	No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.

BOSS MAN	Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
HEROINE	You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.

HEROINE	What?
BOSS MAN	What?
HEROINE	What do you mean what?
BOSS MAN	Huh?
HEROINE	What's going on between you two?
BOSS MAN	Nothing.

HEROINE	What's it for!?
BOSS MAN	Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
HEROINE	Is it gassed up?
BOSS MAN	Fully.
HEROINE	Four door?
BOSS MAN	Two.
HEROINE	Open?
BOSS MAN	Covered.
HEROINE	How many?
BOSS MAN	Holds four.
HEROINE	Max?
BOSS MAN	Seven.
HEROINE	Nine?
BOSS MAN	Seven.
HEROINE	Keys.
BOSS MAN	What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
HEROINE	Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
BOSS MAN	I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.

BOZO	What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
GRANDPA	Get outta here.

GRANDPA	This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
BOZO	Whoa!

GRANDPA	You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
BOZO	Oh? And what's that?
GRANDPA	Sit still, look less like a meal.
BOZO	I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.

GRANDPA	I wouldn't do that, son.
BOZO	They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.

GRANDPA	I'll go with ya.
BOZO	What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.

BOZO	Welcome back.
ROADIE	F-f-fuck you.

ROADIE	They were all over the place.
BOZO	You smell like ass!

ROADIE	Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
BOZO	Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?

ROADIE	Bullshit.
BOZO	No bullshit.

ROADIE	Clever fuckers.
BOZO	What the hell's going on here!?

BOZO	Blow the goddamn hatch!
ROADIE	Clear!

BOZO	Got 'cha!
HEROINE	HOLD THAT TIGHT!

HEROINE	'Eh, Chief?
BOZO	Duh hickey.

HEROINE	Fine, Chief.
BOZO	Gimme the keys.
HEROINE	NO, but I will lock you in.
BOZO	What?
HEROINE	We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.

HEROINE	You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
BOZO	Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
HEROINE	Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?

BOZO	What?!
HEROINE	Move slow and move quiet.
BOZO	No shit.

HEROINE	Move it!
BOZO	You keep that key handy.

HEROINE	Shit!
BOZO	I'm fine! I'm fine!

BOZO	JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
HEROINE	If he doesn't shut up...

HEROINE	Hurry!
BOZO	REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!

BOZO	SHIT.
HEROINE	MOVE YOUR ASS!

HEROINE	COME ON!
BOZO	HELLLLLLLLP!!

BOZO	Yeah, maybe.
HEROINE	Get something on that.

BOZO	Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
HEROINE	There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?

BOZO	You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
PARA	You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
BOZO	I'm sure.

PARA	HELP MEEE!
BOZO	BONSAI!

PARA	I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
BOZO	Amazing you made it this far.

BOZO	Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
PARA	Am I too heavy for you?
BOZO	Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.

BOZO	OH JESUS!
PARA	HELLLPPP!

GOLDIE	Well, maybe they migrate?
HEROINE	As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.

GOLDIE	Hey!
HEROINE	Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?

GOLDIE	Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
HEROINE	Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?

GOLDIE	Yeah, I'll go.
HEROINE	Ok. Let's see what happens.

HEROINE	Let's move.
GOLDIE	I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.

GOOD GUY	Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
HEROINE	Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?

GOOD GUY	What's wrong?
HEROINE	Nothing, just lookin'.

HEROINE	Let's go.
GOOD GUY	She's not very nice, is she?

GOOD GUY	DON'T!
HEROINE	YOU'LL HIT US!

GOOD GUY	Let's wait it out.
HEROINE	They'll tear this place down within the hour.

HEROINE	If you are face to face with her, dive left.
ROADIE	And the last one is the...
HEROINE	Father. The biggest, the strongest...

HEROINE	Okay, well that's something.
ROADIE	So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.

ROADIE	There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
HEROINE	That's fine.

HEROINE	Hold it!
ROADIE	Whoa!

ROADIE	Let's go!
HEROINE	Wait God-dammit!

ROADIE	If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
HEROINE	Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?

HEROINE	Go! Go!
ROADIE	Not without you!!!
HEROINE	Go!!!

HEROINE	Get to your cars!
ROADIE	GO-GO-GO!!

TUFFY	Oh my God... What is that?
HEROINE	That's one piece of four problems.

TUFFY	Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
HEROINE	Stop her!

TUFFY	Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
HEROINE	Let's lock off this room.

TUFFY	Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
HEROINE	All right.

HEROINE	You know you don't have to do this.
TUFFY	I'm fine, I really am.
HEROINE	I admire your strength.
TUFFY	We all have to be strong, right?
HEROINE	Right.

HEROINE	Her name is Charlie.
TUFFY	Oh...
HEROINE	She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
TUFFY	I'll do anything to help.
HEROINE	I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
TUFFY	Deal.

HEROINE	We should stick together out there.
TUFFY	I'd love to.

TUFFY	Did we make it?
HEROINE	I think --

TROOP LEADER	Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
SICKLY BROWNIE	Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.

TROOP LEADER	Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
SICKLY BROWNIE	Um, well...
TROOP LEADER	Are you lying to me?
SICKLY BROWNIE	Well...
TROOP LEADER	What did we say about lying?
SICKLY BROWNIE	I'm not lying.
TROOP LEADER	You know that no one likes a liar, right?
SICKLY BROWNIE	I said I'm not lying.

TROOP LEADER	What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
SICKLY BROWNIE	I just hit it like you said.

QUELLEK	Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
ALEXANDER	Well good, that's very... nice.
QUELLEK	By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
ALEXANDER	Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
QUELLEK	I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
ALEXANDER	Just don't.
QUELLEK	...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.

ALEXANDER	This is it?
QUELLEK	Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
ALEXANDER	Where's my bed?

QUELLEK	Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
ALEXANDER	Is that the bathroom?
QUELLEK	Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.

QUELLEK	Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
ALEXANDER	Thanks.
QUELLEK	Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
ALEXANDER	Uh uh! What did we talk about?
QUELLEK	Right... Sorry, sir.

QUELLEK	Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
ALEXANDER	Quellek. What are you doing in there?
QUELLEK	I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
ALEXANDER	Come with me. I'll explain on the way.

QUELLEK	Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
ALEXANDER	Open.

ALEXANDER	Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
QUELLEK	I'm... I'm shot.

ALEXANDER	Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
QUELLEK	I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
ALEXANDER	No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
QUELLEK	... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...

ALEXANDER	Don't speak, Quellek.
QUELLEK	You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.

JASON	Come on, old friend...
ALEXANDER	Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..

JASON	You WILL go out there.
ALEXANDER	I won't and nothing you say-
JASON	The show must go on.
ALEXANDER	...Damn you!  Damn you!

JASON	I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
ALEXANDER	... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
JASON	Leadership....

ALEXANDER	God, what an ass.
JASON	COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...

JASON	Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
ALEXANDER	Just!?

JASON	At ease men.
ALEXANDER	Like throwing gasoline on a fire...

ALEXANDER	We've got to stop!
JASON	We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
ALEXANDER	You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
JASON	Like YOU know?

JASON	NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
ALEXANDER	DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
JASON	KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!

ALEXANDER	About this much.
JASON	What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
ALEXANDER	THIS much.

JASON	There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
ALEXANDER	Must be some sort of mining facility.

ALEXANDER	Go ahead!
JASON	You go first! There's no time!
ALEXANDER	Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-

JASON	What?  What?
ALEXANDER	Nothing.
JASON	I heard something. A squeal.

ALEXANDER	Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
JASON	KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...

JASON	ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
ALEXANDER	... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
JASON	It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
ALEXANDER	That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
JASON	Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?

ALEXANDER	Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
JASON	Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,

ALEXANDER	Purple skinned monstrosity...?
JASON	I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
ALEXANDER	Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
JASON	I had the shot...

JASON	~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
ALEXANDER	Yes. Good was done this .....
JASON	Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-

ALEXANDER	Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
JASON	No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-

ALEXANDER	He's a twit!
TOMMY	Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?

TOMMY	Not again...
ALEXANDER	I played Richard III...

TOMMY	Settle down, Alex...
ALEXANDER	No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!

TOMMY	What the hell is going on?!!?
ALEXANDER	Jason, what have you gotten us into?

ALEXANDER	He wants to THINK!?
TOMMY	No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!

ALEXANDER	Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
TOMMY	They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...

ALEXANDER	What's happened?
TOMMY	The engines are dead. We're drifting.

TOMMY	You were holding it upside down weren't you?
ALEXANDER	Shut up.
TOMMY	You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
ALEXANDER	You think you could do better "Laredo?"
TOMMY	Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.

ALEXANDER	And note the sucked in gut.
TOMMY	...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...

ALEXANDER	This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
TOMMY	You have a better plan, Alex?
ALEXANDER	As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'

















ALEXANDER	Go into the cloud! ...
L229288	u1041	m68	GWEN	FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
L229287	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
L229279	u1041	m68	GWEN	The ships are gaining...
L229278	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	May I get the check?
L229267	u1041	m68	GWEN	Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
L229266	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	We heard it the first time!
L229085	u1041	m68	GWEN	All this from watching the.. historical records?
L229084	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh my god, It's real.
L228979	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
L228978	u1041	m68	GWEN	I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
L228977	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	A boy comes to the door.
L228976	u1041	m68	GWEN	You could order something in.
L228975	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
L228974	u1041	m68	GWEN	Why didn't you stop at the market?
L228973	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
L228897	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Oh can't I? Watch me!
L228896	u1041	m68	GWEN	Alex you can't -just leave.
L228871	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	Dear God.... How did I come to this?
L228870	u1041	m68	GWEN	Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
L228865	u1041	m68	GWEN	The guy is terminally selfish!
L228864	u1036	m68	ALEXANDER	He's a miserable twit!
L229659	u1037	m68	BRANDON	We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
L229658	u1043	m68	KYLE	I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
L229657	u1037	m68	BRANDON	You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
L229656	u1043	m68	KYLE	Oh.  Okay.
L229655	u1037	m68	BRANDON	No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
L229654	u1043	m68	KYLE	Hi Brandon.
L229036	u1037	m68	BRANDON	He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
L229035	u1043	m68	KYLE	He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
L229765	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
L229764	u1042	m68	JASON	That's It?
L229763	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Raise the glass and push the blue button.
L229762	u1042	m68	JASON	I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
L229730	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
L229729	u1042	m68	JASON	What?  Up?
L229728	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Up.
L229727	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Go. They're off again.
L229725	u1037	m68	BRANDON	GO Commander.
L229724	u1042	m68	JASON	Shit! Go!
L229723	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Lt. Madison, GO.
L229722	u1042	m68	JASON	No, wait, are you-
L229721	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Wait two seconds then go.
L229720	u1042	m68	JASON	Okay, now. But-
L229719	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
L229707	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
L229706	u1042	m68	JASON	BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
L229700	u1037	m68	BRANDON	My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
L229699	u1042	m68	JASON	How did you come to that conclusion?
L229698	u1037	m68	BRANDON	No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
L229697	u1042	m68	JASON	But you don't?
L229696	u1037	m68	BRANDON	It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
L229695	u1042	m68	JASON	What do you mean?
L229694	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
L229693	u1042	m68	JASON	What does the Omega 13 do?
L229692	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Yes Commander?
L229691	u1042	m68	JASON	Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
L229670	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, that's where you want to be.
L229669	u1042	m68	JASON	Yes...?
L229668	u1037	m68	BRANDON	Okay, so do you see a door marked CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
GWEN	Alex? Where are you going?
ALEXANDER	To see if there's a pub.

GWEN	Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
ALEXANDER	Could they be the miners?

GWEN	I don't know.
ALEXANDER	Nobody was WATCHING?

GWEN	Those blue things ate everybody here?
ALEXANDER	It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...

ALEXANDER	He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
GWEN	Down there.

ALEXANDER	You said "the Commander.
GWEN	What?
ALEXANDER	Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
GWEN	No I didn't.
ALEXANDER	Yes you did.

GWEN	He always has to make the big entrance.





BRANDON	Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
JASON	Excuse me guys.

BRANDON	Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
JASON	It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
BRANDON	Yes but, we were wondering-
JASON	There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?

BRANDON	... Yes?
JASON	We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
BRANDON	Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
JASON	What's  your name, son?
BRANDON	Brandon.
JASON	Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
BRANDON	Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
JASON	It's okay. Listen-
BRANDON	... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
JASON	It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
BRANDON	I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
JASON	Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.

JASON	Okay, we got it.
BRANDON	Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.

BRANDON	Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
JASON	Okay...  Okay, now what.
BRANDON	Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.

BRANDON	Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
JASON	We'd never have the budget for this.















COMPUTER	Structural damage at 68 percent.
GWEN	We're getting major structural damage.

GWEN	I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
COMPUTER	Yes?
GWEN	What's the weather like outside?
COMPUTER	There is no weather in space.
GWEN	I never get tired of that joke.

COMPUTER	The ship is sustaining structural damage.
GWEN	Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...

COMPUTER	The enemy is matching velocity.
GWEN	The enemy is matching velocity.

GWEN	Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
COMPUTER	The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
GWEN	It's fractured...

COMPUTER	Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
GWEN	We need another one.

COMPUTER	Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
GWEN	No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.

COMPUTER	Systems register functional.
GWEN	All systems are working, Commander.

COMPUTER	Systems register functional.

FRED	U.... What do you think?
NERVOUS TECH	That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
FRED	... What does that mean?
NERVOUS TECH	What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
FRED	Covalent... Right. So...
NERVOUS TECH	So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
FRED	OK!

FRED	Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
JASON	I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.

FRED	A hologram...
JASON	Never mind, Fred....
FRED	No, no... I'll think on it...

JASON	The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
FRED	Right.
JASON	I'll take my chances with Gorignak.

FRED	No, I'll kill you. .
JASON	Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..

JASON	Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
FRED	You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.

FRED	As good as Hopkins?
JASON	Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.

GUY	How do you remember this stuff?
FRED	Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.

FRED	You Okay, Alex?
GUY	I don't like this... I don't like this at all...

FRED	...The digital conveyor.
GUY	Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!

FRED	We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
GUY	Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
FRED	It's suicide.
GUY	I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
FRED	Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?

GUY	Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
GWEN	Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.

GUY	Crewman #6... Call me Guy.
GWEN	You... know us?

GWEN	THAT'S why you built this ship?
GUY	It's ... incredible.

GUY	The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
GWEN	The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.

GWEN	Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
GUY	Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?

GWEN	Where are the miners?
GUY	Something BAD happened here.

GWEN	Oh, they're so cute.
GUY	Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...

GUY	I am SO SICK of being right.
GWEN	Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.

GWEN	How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
GUY	We're doing episode 31, Jason?

GUY	...Okay
JASON	All right. Put me back on with him.

GUY	They're still behind us...
JASON	We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...

JASON	Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
GUY	Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
JASON	Your last name.
GUY	Yeah, what is it?
JASON	It's... I don't know.
GUY	No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?

GUY	We're screwed... We're so screwed...
JASON	All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.

GUY	That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
JASON	Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?

JASON	It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
GUY	Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
JASON	It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
GUY	BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!

GUY	I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
JASON	A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'

GUY	We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
JASON	No. Keep all energy to the armor.

GUY	Hi everybody.
TOMMY	Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
GUY	Guy... You probably don't remember me do you?   I was on the show in '82.  Episode 31?  Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "Crewman #6?"

GUY	More to the left... Stay parallel...
TOMMY	Hey, YOU want to drive?

TOMMY	Assault on Voltareck III.  Episode... 31 I think.
GUY	We're doing episode 31?
TOMMY	Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.

TOMMY	They're gone.
GUY	Where'd they go? Back inside?

TOMMY	You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
GUY	Not a clue. You?
TOMMY	I think he just likes pointing at things.

GUY	We're alive!
TOMMY	We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.

GUY	~e're alive!
TOMMY	We made it. Commander, we made it.'

JASON	A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
GWEN	How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
JASON	What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.

GWEN	What?
JASON	You smiled at me.

JASON	This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
GWEN	You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...

JASON	It's Jason...
GWEN	One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
JASON	Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-

JASON	Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
GWEN	Only answers to me.
JASON	But I'm the Commander!
GWEN	On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
JASON	C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.

GWEN	Wait. When are you going to tell them?
JASON	Tell them? About...
GWEN	Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
JASON	Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
GWEN	Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
JASON	It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
GWEN	Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...

JASON	Hey... Hey where are you going?
GWEN	We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
JASON	Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!

GWEN	We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
JASON	Let me think. I need time to think.

GWEN	There's nobody here. Jason...
JASON	Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.

JASON	All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
GWEN	Jason..
JASON	We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
GWEN	JASON...
JASON	You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?

JASON	I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
GWEN	I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
JASON	Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...

JASON	Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
GWEN	I don't think that's a cloud...

JASON	Are they behind us?
GWEN	No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.

JASON	Can it be repaired?
GWEN	Computer, can it be repaired?

JASON	Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
GWEN	Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?

GWEN	Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
JASON	Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
GWEN	I could have held on to YOU! ...

GWEN	You're playing your good side.
JASON	Don't be ridiculous.

JASON	All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
GWEN	Why does this sound so familiar?

GWEN	How does the rolling help, actually?
JASON	It helps.

GWEN	Clenched jaw...
JASON	Will you stop RIDING ME?!

GWEN	Jason.. Can you hear me?
JASON	Yes. Yes, I'm here!

GWEN	Thank God. Are you okay?
JASON	Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
GWEN	Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.

JASON	What?  What did he say?
GWEN	Nothing. Hold please.

JASON	Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
GWEN	Turn on the translation circuit.

GWEN	Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
JASON	What the hell are you talking about?

GWEN	So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
JASON	Right.
GWEN	Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
JASON	No I don't. But I know somebody who does.

JASON	There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
GWEN	Wait... Jason, Here!...

GWEN	What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
JASON	Gwen...
GWEN	We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
JASON	Because it was on the show!
GWEN	Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!

GWEN	He's accelerating to Mark 6.
JASON	Mark 12.

GWEN	never doubted you for a second.
JASON	TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!

TOMMY	Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
GWEN	This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.

GWEN	You're kidding. When for?
TOMMY	Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.

GWEN	Unbelievable.
TOMMY	You are so full of shit

GWEN	You gotta admit, they do love him.
TOMMY	Almost as much as he loves himself.

TOMMY	That's it, It's go time.
GWEN	Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.

TOMMY	You should have let me hit him.
GWEN	I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!

TOMMY	You know, that's really getting annoying.
GWEN	I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
TOMMY	Sure, no problem.

GWEN	Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
TOMMY	I can't...  It's on autopilot!...

GWEN	We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
TOMMY	That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
GWEN	Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"

TOMMY	I heard it too.
GWEN	Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?

TOMMY	JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
TOMMY	Closer?  I can try.

GWEN	Tommy, look!  Those lights...

SARRIS	First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
JASON	Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.

JASON	Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
SARRIS	Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.

JASON	Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
SARRIS	Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
JASON	Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
SARRIS	You have ten seconds.
JASON	All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.

JASON	Yes.
SARRIS	Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
JASON	I don't know.

SARRIS	Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
JASON	Stop, please! I don't know!
SARRIS	Prepare a tear harness for the female...
JASON	No! I swear I don't know! Please!
SARRIS	Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?

SARRIS	Wait. What did you say?
JASON	Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.

SARRIS	Explain -
JASON	Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.

JASON	My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
SARRIS	Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
JASON	We pretend...
SARRIS	Simpler.
JASON	We.. We lie.
SARRIS	Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...

JASON	Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
SARRIS	This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.

MATHESAR	Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
JASON	Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
MATHESAR	I... certainly, but-
JASON	Catch me later, okay?

MATHESAR	Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
JASON	Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.

MATHESAR	Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
JASON	Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
MATHESAR	As you wish.

MATHESAR	Commander?... Where are you... going?
JASON	Home.
MATHESAR	You... You mean Earth?
JASON	Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.

MATHESAR	But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
JASON	Right. Long live... What's your planet?
MATHESAR	Theramin.
JASON	Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
MATHESAR	But what if Sarris survives?
JASON	Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
MATHESAR	He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
JASON	I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...

MATHESAR	An interstellar vox.
JASON	Thanks

MATHESAR	How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
JASON	It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.

MATHESAR	Weapons storage...
JASON	It's perfectly safe. I promise.
MATHESAR	... Maintenance facility...

MATHESAR	To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
JASON	Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!

JASON	Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
MATHESAR	NO, Thank God he has not.
JASON	Then how did he find out about the device?
MATHESAR	Our former Commander was not... Strong.
JASON	Former Commander?
MATHESAR	I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.

MATHESAR	Commander...
JASON	Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.

JASON	Mathesar? What is that?
MATHESAR	It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.

MATHESAR	A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
JASON	You what?.. What are you talking about?
MATHESAR	We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...

MATHESAR	Deception... "Lies."
JASON	Well... Sort of...
MATHESAR	We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.

JASON	I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
MATHESAR	But there it is!...
JASON	A model, only as big as this.
MATHESAR	But... Inside, I have seen-
JASON	Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
MATHESAR	But...Why?
JASON	It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.

MATHESAR	The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
JASON	You can oc that?

TOMMY	You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
JASON	I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.

TOMMY	... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
JASON	And determination.

JASON	That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
TOMMY	Wh... Where are we?
JASON	Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.

TOMMY	What's going on?
JASON	I think we're going to exit the space port.

TOMMY	Excuse me?
JASON	They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...

JASON	Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
TOMMY	Why don't you just turn it on and see?

TOMMY	Where?
JASON	Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!

JASON	Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
TOMMY	It's as far as it goes!

TOMMY	Could be this.
JASON	Push It. Hold it down.

JASON	Do your best, Tommy...
TOMMY	Oh god...

JASON	All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
TOMMY	What kind of signal?
JASON	Anything.
TOMMY	Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
JASON	Tommy, we have these...

TOMMY	Oh, right, sorry.
JASON	Okay, let's go.

TOMMY	Sorry Guys... It just went off.
JASON	Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!

JASON	Okay... On what?
TOMMY	How about the pig-lizard?
JASON	Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.

TOMMY	Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
JASON	It doesn't have eyes.
TOMMY	The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
JASON	It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!

TOMMY	NO NO NO.
JASON	We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry

JASON	All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
TOMMY	Jason? What about me? What do I do?
JASON	Practice driving, Tommy.

JASON	Pedal to the metal Tommy...
TOMMY	Pedal to the metal...

JASON	Let's do it, Tommy.
TOMMY	Commander?... Call me Laredo?
JASON	Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.

JASON	Hold course, Laredo!
TOMMY	I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...

LATHE	Continue forward, sir?
SARRIS	Patience, Lt. . Patience.

SARRIS	Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
LATHE	The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.

SARRIS	Find them.
LATHE	But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
SARRIS	Find them.

LATHE	enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
SARRIS	Get oacK on their tail.

SARRIS	WHAT? WH
LATHE	Because they're coming right at us.
SARRIS	Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR

CHILI	What is this?
ATTENDANT	An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
CHILI	I reserved a Cadillac.
ATTENDANT	Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
CHILI	You're kidding me, right?
ATTENDANT	Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.

BO CATLETT	Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
BEAR	You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
BO CATLETT	You see that? The way the man just went right over?

BEAR	Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
BO CATLETT	Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.

BO CATLETT	And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
BEAR	Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
BO CATLETT	Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
BEAR	They all sound big at the talking stage.

BEAR	He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
BO CATLETT	So where's the money?
BEAR	I guess still in the locker.
BO CATLETT	You guess? You mean you don't know?
BEAR	I mean I don't care.

BEAR	You see the paper?
BO CATLETT	I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
BEAR	His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
BO CATLETT	Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.

BO CATLETT	Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
BEAR	I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
BO CATLETT	Who?
BEAR	Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
BO CATLETT	Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
BEAR	Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
BO CATLETT	Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
BEAR	That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.

BO CATLETT	He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
BEAR	Come here, Farrah...

BO CATLETT	I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
BEAR	Farrah. Come here.

BEAR	After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
BO CATLETT	Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
BEAR	What about him?
BO CATLETT	I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
BEAR	And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
BO CATLETT	Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.

BO CATLETT	You get the money?
BEAR	No. What's this?
BO CATLETT	Plan B. Here ya go, honey...

BEAR	Trade for what?
BO CATLETT	The money. Fuck. I gotta think...

BEAR	You get life for kidnapping.
BO CATLETT	Calm down, Bear...
BEAR	Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?

BEAR	Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
BO CATLETT	Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.

BEAR	And that's for the airport.
BO CATLETT	Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
BEAR	We'll get it later.

BO CATLETT	You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
BEAR	You're right.

CHILI	I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
BEAR	So you didn't have the key with you.
CHILI	You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
BEAR	You spotted them, huh?

CHILI	What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
BEAR	I have to ask you for that key.
CHILI	What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
BEAR	Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
CHILI	You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.

CHILI	Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
BEAR	I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.

CHILI	What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
BEAR	Not too bad.
CHILI	How 'bout when you went down the stairs?

BEAR	I think I pulled my quadriceps.
CHILI	So... how many movies you been in?
BEAR	About sixty.
CHILI	No shit? What're some of 'em?

ESCOBAR	Where is my nephew?
BO CATLETT	Your who?
ESCOBAR	Yayo. Where is he?

ESCOBAR	He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
BO CATLETT	Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
ESCOBAR	He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
BO CATLETT	Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
ESCOBAR	You gave him the money?
BO CATLETT	I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
ESCOBAR	Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
BO CATLETT	Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
ESCOBAR	A zillion, huh? That's a lot.

BO CATLETT	Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
ESCOBAR	Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
BO CATLETT	He's around someplace.
ESCOBAR	I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?

BO CATLETT	You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
ESCOBAR	I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.

BO CATLETT	What's this movie you're doing first?
CHILI	Harry, let me answer that.

CHILI	But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
BO CATLETT	You can talk to me.
CHILI	That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...

BO CATLETT	You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
CHILI	That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.

BO CATLETT	I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
CHILI	I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.

BO CATLETT	Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
CHILI	It's what he said, I'm his associate.
BO CATLETT	You must bring something heavy to the deal.
CHILI	That's right, me.

BO CATLETT	Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
CHILI	Yeah, we're getting Martin.
BO CATLETT	No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
CHILI	I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
BO CATLETT	I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
CHILI	Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
BO CATLETT	I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
CHILI	Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
BO CATLETT	So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?

CHILI	Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
BO CATLETT	I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.

CHILI	There's Ilona.
BO CATLETT	What about her?
CHILI	Get something going there.
BO CATLETT	With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
CHILI	She's... young.
BO CATLETT	Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
CHILI	Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
BO CATLETT	Who?
CHILI	She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.

CHILI	You know how to write one of these?
BO CATLETT	There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
CHILI	That's all there is to it, huh?
BO CATLETT	That's all.

BO CATLETT	I really think I can be of service on this one.
CHILI	Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.

BO CATLETT	I need the money.
CHILI	What money?
BO CATLETT	The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
CHILI	Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?

CHILI	I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
BO CATLETT	Tell you what...

BO CATLETT	How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
CHILI	What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
BO CATLETT	In just a second. Two...
CHILI	I don't believe this.
BO CATLETT	Three.

CHILI	Karen? You okay?
BO CATLETT	She can't talk right now.

BO CATLETT	That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
CHILI	Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
BO CATLETT	Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.

BO CATLETT	You know Laurel Canyon?
CHILI	I'll find it.
BO CATLETT	I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
CHILI	Gimme an hour.

CHILI	Where's Karen?
BO CATLETT	In the can. That the money?

BO CATLETT	She's great. Gimme the money.
CHILI	First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.

BO CATLETT	You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
CHILI	What?

BO CATLETT	Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
CHILI	It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
BO CATLETT	Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
CHILI	Bear, you're not really gonna -

BO CATLETT	Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
HARRY	I can't do it.
BO CATLETT	You positive about that?
HARRY	It's a different kind of deal.

HARRY	Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -
BO CATLETT	You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
HARRY	I'm working on a few things.
BO CATLETT	Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
HARRY	Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?

BO CATLETT	Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
HARRY	Chili Palmer showed you my script?
BO CATLETT	Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.

BO CATLETT	Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
HARRY	You serious?
BO CATLETT	All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.

BO CATLETT	How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
HARRY	You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
BO CATLETT	We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.

BO CATLETT	He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
HARRY	Leo, I don't know.

HARRY	Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
BO CATLETT	Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
HARRY	The airport.
BO CATLETT	It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.

HARRY	I don't know.
BO CATLETT	It's not the kind of thing you do.

HARRY	C-18.
BO CATLETT	That's the magic number.

RONNIE	I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
BO CATLETT	What I been wondering is where's he been.
RONNIE	Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.

BO CATLETT	Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
RONNIE	By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.

BO CATLETT	You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
RONNIE	I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
BO CATLETT	What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.

HARRY	Ray Barboni?
BONES	Who is this?
HARRY	Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
BONES	Depends. Who's this?
HARRY	Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
BONES	What three hundred grand?
HARRY	The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.

HARRY	Hello? You there?
BONES	Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
HARRY	Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
BONES	Okay. So who are you?
HARRY	I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
BONES	Who?
HARRY	Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
BONES	Never heard of him.
HARRY	Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.

BONES	So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
HARRY	Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
BONES	Or else what?
HARRY	Or else use your fucking imagination.

BONES	Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
HARRY	Ray. Look at me.

BONES	What?
HARRY	Look at me, Ray.
BONES	You say look at you?
HARRY	That's correct. Look at me.

CHILI	How'd you get in here?
BONES	I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
CHILI	So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
BONES	Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.

CHILI	Why would I do that?
BONES	'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.

CHILI	I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
BONES	Yeah? Which terminal?
CHILI	Sovereign.
BONES	You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
CHILI	I like it here.

BONES	Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
CHILI	Whatever you want, Ray.

RONNIE	Who the fuck are you?
BONES	Ray Barboni. From Miami.
RONNIE	What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?

RONNIE	The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
BONES	He owes me money.
RONNIE	Get in line, bro.
BONES	I don't like waiting.
RONNIE	Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
BONES	Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.

BONES	You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
RONNIE	Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.

CURTIS	You live in Miami?
CHILI	That's right.
CURTIS	What're you doing in Los Angeles?
CHILI	I'm in the movie business.
CURTIS	You're an investor, is that it?
CHILI	I'm a producer.
CURTIS	You have a card in here?
CHILI	Not yet. I just started.

CURTIS	Your wife a Lakers fan?
CHILI	I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.

CURTIS	By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
CHILI	It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
CURTIS	Something shouldn't be there.
CHILI	Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
CURTIS	That's the idea. I'll think about it.
CHILI	That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
CURTIS	Get him out've here.

DICK	Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
CHILI	Leo spanked a waitress?
DICK	Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.

DICK	Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
CHILI	What've you got?
DICK	Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
CHILI	Movie producer? Yeah, why not.

HARRY	Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
CHILI	Where you been, Harry?

HARRY	Have we met? I don't recall.
CHILI	We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.

HARRY	Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
CHILI	You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.

HARRY	I'm looking at you.
CHILI	I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
HARRY	That's what I'm doing.
CHILI	You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
HARRY	Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
CHILI	We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.

HARRY	Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
CHILI	Harry, lemme give you some advice.

CHILI	A marker's like a check, Harry.
HARRY	I know what a marker is.
CHILI	They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...

CHILI	You're not looking at me, Harry.
HARRY	Why do I have to keep looking at you?
CHILI	I want you to.
HARRY	You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
CHILI	Come on, Harry - Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
HARRY	Fuckin' basketball game.

CHILI	You make movies, huh?
HARRY	I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.

HARRY	Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
CHILI	Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?

HARRY	You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
CHILI	You just did.
HARRY	I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.

HARRY	It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
CHILI	Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.

HARRY	Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
CHILI	That's right. As a matter of fact...

HARRY	Keep going.
CHILI	Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...

HARRY	So he comes to L.A...
CHILI	I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.

HARRY	That's it? That's your movie?
CHILI	I said I had an idea, that's all.
HARRY	That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
CHILI	The shylock's the good guy.
HARRY	The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.

CHILI	Part of it, yeah.
HARRY	Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
CHILI	You mean, Leo?
HARRY	You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
CHILI	I'm not the guy, Harry.
HARRY	But you work for the casino?
CHILI	I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
HARRY	So you don't work for the casino?

HARRY	Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
CHILI	What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.

HARRY	I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
CHILI	They always paid.

HARRY	You pack a gun?
CHILI	Not really.
HARRY	What does that mean?
CHILI	Maybe a few times I have.
HARRY	Ever shot anybody.
CHILI	Once.
HARRY	Really? You ever been arrested?
CHILI	I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
HARRY	Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?

HARRY	These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal - this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer -
CHILI	Harry, look at me.

CHILI	You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
HARRY	Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
CHILI	You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
HARRY	Because I need half a million to buy a script.
CHILI	For a movie?
HARRY	A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
CHILI	What's it called?
HARRY	Mr. Lovejoy.
CHILI	Mr. Lovejoy? That's the title?
HARRY	It's not bad when you know what it's about.

HARRY	Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
CHILI	Who's the star?

HARRY	Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
CHILI	Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
HARRY	One of his best parts.
CHILI	No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
HARRY	Ride the Clouds. Good picture.

CHILI	She looks familiar.
HARRY	She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.

HARRY	Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
CHILI	So what's the problem?
HARRY	The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
CHILI	He drown?
HARRY	Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.

HARRY	Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
CHILI	So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
HARRY	That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
CHILI	I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
HARRY	Just a thought.
CHILI	But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
HARRY	You don't even know these guys.
CHILI	Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
HARRY	What do you get out of this?
CHILI	Let's see how we get along.

CHILI	Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
HARRY	Read it. It's a grabber.

CHILI	No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
HARRY	They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
CHILI	That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.

CHILI	You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
HARRY	You're kidding, right?

HARRY	What?
CHILI	I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
HARRY	I had to tell 'em something.
CHILI	Never say anything unless you have to.

CHILI	You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
HARRY	I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
CHILI	That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
HARRY	His shrink's trainer.

HARRY	How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
CHILI	Hey, Harry.
HARRY	Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!

CHILI	Here's your keys, Harry.
HARRY	Get the fuck outta my chair.

CHILI	Is he giving you a check or cash?
HARRY	Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.

CHILI	Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
HARRY	I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.

HARRY	Really.
CHILI	Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
HARRY	A meeting with who? You and Karen?

HARRY	So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
CHILI	I found him.

CHILI	Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
HARRY	You have it?
CHILI	Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
HARRY	Who?
CHILI	Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
HARRY	Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
CHILI	Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...

HARRY	Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
CHILI	Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.

RAY BONES	You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
CHILI	Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.

RAY BONES	You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
CHILI	He died.
RAY BONES	How'd you know he died, he tell you?

CHILI	Yeah, he told me.
RAY BONES	Personally?
CHILI	Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
RAY BONES	What Get Away jet?
CHILI	It was in the Herald.
RAY BONES	Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
CHILI	Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.

RAY BONES	Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
CHILI	'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
RAY BONES	Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
CHILI	Ask your man here.

RAY BONES	You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
CHILI	Twenty seven hundred.
RAY BONES	Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.

MARTIN	Yeah. That was a good party.
CHILI	You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
MARTIN	Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.

CHILI	Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
MARTIN	A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
CHILI	We talk different?
MARTIN	It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
CHILI	You mean like we don't give a shit.
MARTIN	Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.

CHILI	So you don't know what I'm thinking.
MARTIN	No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
CHILI	So you want to know.
MARTIN	If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
CHILI	I'm thinking of a movie.
MARTIN	One of mine?
CHILI	One we're producing.
MARTIN	With what? Wiseguy money?

CHILI	Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
MARTIN	What happened? The pressure got to you?
CHILI	Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.

MARTIN	Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
CHILI	Martin, look at me.
MARTIN	I'm looking at you.

CHILI	No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
MARTIN	Like this?
CHILI	What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
MARTIN	Wait. How about this?
CHILI	Now you're squinting like you need glasses.

MARTIN	How about this?
CHILI	That's not bad.
MARTIN	That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
CHILI	I believe it.
MARTIN	I turn it on when I confront the guy.
CHILI	Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
MARTIN	How do I know that?

MARTIN	The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
CHILI	Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.

MARTIN	So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
CHILI	It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
MARTIN	Okay. I'm listening.

CHILI	At that point, basically, that has to be it.
MARTIN	You're not going to tell me the rest?

MARTIN	Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
CHILI	Buddy?

MARTIN	Very nice...
CHILI	Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
MARTIN	What's that?
CHILI	Compass.
MARTIN	Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?

MARTIN	Whatta you think, Chill?
CHILI	That's not bad. I think you got it down.

CHILI	I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
LEO	I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
CHILI	You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
LEO	They report it to the IRS.
CHILI	You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.

CHILI	You've been losing.
LEO	I'm up twelve grand today.
CHILI	From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
LEO	Who told you that?
CHILI	Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
LEO	How'd you know I was here?
CHILI	Here's another tip...

LEO	It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
CHILI	I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
LEO	How? By taking my money?
CHILI	You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
LEO	It's all mine.
CHILI	Sit down, Leo.

LEO	You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
CHILI	At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.

LEO	But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
CHILI	I'll find you, Leo...

MANAGER	It's not one of these?
CHILI	You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
MANAGER	Maybe you don't see my sign?

MANAGER	We call you a taxi.
CHILI	Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
MANAGER	Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
CHILI	I know who he works for. Where's your phone.

CHILI	The door from the patio, in back.
KAREN	You broke in?
CHILI	No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
KAREN	What if it was?

CHILI	Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
KAREN	I know what a vig is.

KAREN	The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
CHILI	That's right. Three percent.
KAREN	But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
CHILI	A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
KAREN	A real bargain.

CHILI	A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
KAREN	How much is the wife offered?

CHILI	Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
KAREN	What're you doing here?
CHILI	I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
KAREN	Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
CHILI	No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
KAREN	Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
CHILI	Rough day on the set?
KAREN	I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
CHILI	Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
KAREN	...That's what we finally decided.
CHILI	Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.

KAREN	You saw that one?
CHILI	Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
KAREN	Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
CHILI	For any movie.
KAREN	I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
CHILI	Man, can you scream.
KAREN	Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
CHILI	Cotton.
KAREN	Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'

CHILI	How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
KAREN	I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
CHILI	You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
KAREN	He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
CHILI	That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
KAREN	Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
CHILI	Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
KAREN	Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
CHILI	Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
KAREN	Don't go out of your way.

CHILI	Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
KAREN	Right. See how your story ends.
CHILI	Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?

CHILI	You been here the whole time?
KAREN	I just caught the end.

CHILI	I got you a copy of the script.
KAREN	I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
CHILI	What do you think?

KAREN	I think it's not horrible.
CHILI	I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
KAREN	Then you've read it?
CHILI	Not yet.
KAREN	You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
CHILI	There a part in it for you?
KAREN	I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
CHILI	Sounds fair.
KAREN	What do you get out of it?

CHILI	That why you came over here, to ask me that?
KAREN	I want to know.
CHILI	Why does anyone want to be in movies?
KAREN	Yesterday, you were a loan shark.

CHILI	I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
KAREN	And you think the movie business is any different?
CHILI	Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.

CHILI	This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
KAREN	You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.

KAREN	Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
CHILI	Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.

KAREN	A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
CHILI	The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.

KAREN	That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
CHILI	Depends, who pays?
KAREN	Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.

CHILI	How'd you meet Martin anyway?
KAREN	Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
CHILI	I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
KAREN	You don't like Martin much, do you?
CHILI	Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
KAREN	For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.

KAREN	So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
CHILI	How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
KAREN	How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
CHILI	That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.

KAREN	Yeah?
CHILI	Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
KAREN	Really.

KAREN	I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
CHILI	You thought I was faking?
KAREN	No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
CHILI	Oh.

CHILI	You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
KAREN	Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

CHILI	I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
KAREN	Hey, Chili? Look at me.

KAREN	Harry... My God...
CHILI	What happened?

CHILI	What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
KAREN	Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.

CHILI	Why not?
KAREN	Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.

KAREN	Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
CHILI	Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.

CHILI	You sure?
KAREN	He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
CHILI	It's not Dave. It's a movie.
KAREN	Are you going down?
CHILI	I don't know.
KAREN	You're as bad as Harry...
CHILI	I'll go. I'll go.

CHILI	You okay?
KAREN	Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.

CHILI	Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
KAREN	Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...

KAREN	Were you scared up there?
CHILI	You bet.
KAREN	You don't act like it?
CHILI	I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?

CHILI	I'll be right back.
KAREN	Go get your stuff.

KAREN	What took you so long?
CHILI	Couldn't find my toothbrush.

CHILI	They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
TOMMY	Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
CHILI	What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.

CHILI	Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
TOMMY	What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.

TOMMY	You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
CHILI	That's what the guy said.
TOMMY	Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.

TOMMY	Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
CHILI	Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.

TOMMY	No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
CHILI	That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
TOMMY	In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.

TOMMY	I told you not to -
CHILI	Don't say a fuckin' word.

TOMMY	I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
CHILI	You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
TOMMY	No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
CHILI	You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
TOMMY	All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
CHILI	How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
TOMMY	He already knew it.
CHILI	Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
TOMMY	Whatta you doing out there?
CHILI	I'm going into the movie business.
TOMMY	What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
CHILI	I'm thinking about producing.
TOMMY	How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
CHILI	I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
TOMMY	Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.

HARRY	Yeah, but whose point of view?
DIRECTOR	Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
HARRY	Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?

HARRY	All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
DIRECTOR	What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
HARRY	She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.

DIRECTOR	Yeah? What three words, Harry?
HARRY	Pick 'n' Save.
DIRECTOR	Hm?
HARRY	You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.

HARRY	So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
DIRECTOR	That's great, Harry. So what's the --
HARRY	What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.

HARRY	Hello, Doris.
DORIS	Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.

DORIS	Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
HARRY	Come on in.

DORIS	What a spectacular view.
HARRY	Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?

DORIS	I miss Murray, Harry.
HARRY	Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
DORIS	What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.

HARRY	I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
DORIS	You seem to feel fine about it.
HARRY	I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
DORIS	Murray's dead.

HARRY	So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
DORIS	No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
HARRY	Yeah, what'd he have to say?
DORIS	He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
HARRY	How honorable of you.

HARRY	What's wrong?
KAREN	Be quiet and listen.
HARRY	I don't hear anything.

KAREN	When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
HARRY	Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
KAREN	I don't have a dog.
HARRY	You don't? What happened to Muff?
KAREN	Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?

HARRY	Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
KAREN	Harry -
HARRY	I'm going.

KAREN	How did you get in the house?
HARRY	He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
KAREN	Maybe you didn't hear me.

KAREN	That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
HARRY	That's where you got the idea?

KAREN	With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
HARRY	Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
KAREN	Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
HARRY	No problem. You go on off to bed.

KAREN	What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
HARRY	Oh, yeah, sure.

KAREN	Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
HARRY	He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.

KAREN	Harry, we spoke with Martin.
HARRY	'We?'
KAREN	Chili and me.

KAREN	Harry -
HARRY	Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.

HARRY	Which two?
MARTIN	Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
HARRY	Mob guy?

MARTIN	I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
HARRY	What money?
MARTIN	The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
HARRY	Shylock?

MARTIN	Karen. Wow. Look at you...
KAREN	Hello, Martin.

MARTIN	I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
KAREN	Really.
MARTIN	Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
KAREN	'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.

KAREN	Oh, for Christ's sake -
MARTIN	I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.

KAREN	Lufkin. His... agent.
MARTIN	Yeah, Karen knows him.
KAREN	But you are interested?
MARTIN	I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?

MARTIN	Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
KAREN	Thanks.

MARTIN	I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
KAREN	And after all, you have such morals.

DANA	Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
JANOSZ	You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
DANA	Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.

JANOSZ	We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
DANA	Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.

JANOSZ	Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
DANA	I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
JANOSZ	Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.

DANA	Janosz?
JANOSZ	Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?

JANOSZ	Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
DANA	No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
JANOSZ	Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
DANA	Good night, Janosz.

JANOSZ	Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
DANA	Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.

DANA	What do you want with my baby?
JANOSZ	No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
DANA	If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
JANOSZ	I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
DANA	Everybody has a choice.
JANOSZ	Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
DANA	I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.

JANOSZ	Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
DANA	We don't have a relationship.
JANOSZ	I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
DANA	I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
JANOSZ	Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
DANA	I'd rather not.

DANA	Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
SPENGLER	I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.

DANA	What are you working on, Egon?
SPENGLER	I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.

SPENGLER	We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
DANA	Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
SPENGLER	Oh no.
DANA	Do you ever see him?
SPENGLER	Occasionally
DANA	How is he these days?
SPENGLER	Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
DANA	Does he ever mention me?
SPENGLER	No.  Not that I can recall.

DANA	This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
SPENGLER	Certainly.
DANA	Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
SPENGLER	I won't.
DANA	Thank you.

DANA	Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
FRANK	I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
DANA	You're also a human being, Frank.
FRANK	Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
DANA	Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.

FRANK	Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
FRANK	That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
DANA	Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
FRANK	Didn't I do it?

DANA	No, you didn't, Frank.
FRANK	Okay, that's no problem.
DANA	That's exactly what you said last week.

DANA	Hello, Peter.
VENKMAN	You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
DANA	I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
VENKMAN	I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.

VENKMAN	So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
DANA	He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
VENKMAN	He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
DANA	You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
VENKMAN	Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
DANA	Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
VENKMAN	I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.

DANA	What do you think?
VENKMAN	There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
DANA	His name is Oscar.
VENKMAN	Oscar!  You poor kid!
DANA	Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
VENKMAN	Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.

DANA	I'll do it.
VENKMAN	I'll supervise.

VENKMAN	Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
DANA	We definitely had a moment or two.

DANA	That's where the buggy stopped.
VENKMAN	Okay, let's take a look.

DANA	I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
VENKMAN	You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
DANA	Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
VENKMAN	Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
DANA	You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
VENKMAN	I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
DANA	Good luck.
VENKMAN	Thanks.

VENKMAN	So this is what you do, huh?
DANA	Oh, hello, Peter.
VENKMAN	You're really good, you know.
DANA	I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.

DANA	I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
VENKMAN	As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.

DANA	He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
VENKMAN	Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.

VENKMAN	I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
DANA	Good-bye, Peter.
VENKMAN	I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!

DANA	I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
VENKMAN	No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
DANA	Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.

VENKMAN	You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
DANA	I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
VENKMAN	Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
DANA	I don't know what to do anymore.
VENKMAN	I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.

VENKMAN	This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
DANA	Peter, what about the bathtub?
VENKMAN	We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
DANA	It was full of this awful pink ooze.
VENKMAN	Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.

VENKMAN	Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
DANA	Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.

VENKMAN	Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
DANA	Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
VENKMAN	For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
DANA	How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
VENKMAN	Or we could do that.
DANA	Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
VENKMAN	I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!

VENKMAN	Are you all squeaky clean now?
DANA	Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?

DANA	They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
VENKMAN	Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
DANA	I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
VENKMAN	It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
DANA	Does she know anything about babies?
VENKMAN	Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
DANA	Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.

VENKMAN	Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
DANA	I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
VENKMAN	I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.

VENKMAN	So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
DANA	I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
VENKMAN	Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
DANA	For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
VENKMAN	All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
DANA	Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
VENKMAN	I'm not even good for me.
DANA	Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
VENKMAN	Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
DANA	So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
VENKMAN	Let me jingle you right now.

DANA	Maybe I should call Janine.
VENKMAN	Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.

DANA	I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
VENKMAN	Finally came to your senses, huh?

DANA	That's not true.  It was 1620.
VENKMAN	Same difference.

DANA	That's a terrible thing to say.
VENKMAN	So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.

DANA	Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
STANTZ	No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
DANA	Hi, Egon.

STANTZ	Is this the spot?
DANA	A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.

STANTZ	I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
DANA	Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.

STANTZ	Sorry!
DANA	Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.

ELAINE	According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
VENKMAN	Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
ELAINE	I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
VENKMAN	Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
ELAINE	It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
VENKMAN	No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.

HARDEMEYER	Can I help you?
VENKMAN	Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.

HARDEMEYER	I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
VENKMAN	I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
HARDEMEYER	I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
VENKMAN	No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
HARDEMEYER	Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?

HARDEMEYER	That's quite a story.
VENKMAN	Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.

HARDEMEYER	Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
VENKMAN	Now you're talking.

HARDEMEYER	Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
VENKMAN	Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.

LOUIS	What is it, honey?
JANINE	It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
LOUIS	Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.

JANINE	Who are you going to call?
LOUIS	Ghostbusters.

LOUIS	Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
JANINE	What are you doing up here?
LOUIS	I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
JANINE	Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
LOUIS	Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.

JANINE	Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
LOUIS	No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
JANINE	That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.

JANINE	Well, good night, Louis.
LOUIS	Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
JANINE	I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
LOUIS	Oh, sure, that sounds great.

JANINE	I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
LOUIS	So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
JANINE	It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
LOUIS	So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.

JANINE	You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
LOUIS	Okay.

JANINE	Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
LOUIS	Tonight?

LOUIS	Should we go?
JANINE	I don't think we should leave her alone.
LOUIS	You're right.  We should stay.

JANINE	I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
LOUIS	Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
JANINE	You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.

JANOSZ	Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
VENKMAN	How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?

JANOSZ	It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
VENKMAN	Too bad for the Moldavians.

JANOSZ	We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
VENKMAN	Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.

VENKMAN	I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
JANOSZ	My pleasure.

JANOSZ	Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
VENKMAN	I know.
JANOSZ	Then why have you come?
VENKMAN	We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.

VENKMAN	You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
JANOSZ	The Upper West Side.

VENKMAN	This is the one that looked at Dana.
JANOSZ	It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
VENKMAN	I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.

JANOSZ	So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
VENKMAN	Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.

JANOSZ	You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
VENKMAN	Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.

VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
JANOSZ	Command me, lord.
VIGO	On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.

VIGO	I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
JANOSZ	Yes, the scourge --
VIGO	-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
JANOSZ	-- the sorrow --
VIGO	I command you.
JANOSZ	I await the word of Vigo.
VIGO	The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
JANOSZ	Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
VIGO	So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.

JUDGE	Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
VENKMAN	Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.

JUDGE	You've got to do something!
VENKMAN	Who are they?
JUDGE	They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
VENKMAN	Maybe they just want to appeal.

VENKMAN	These boys aren't playing around.
JUDGE	You've got to stop them.  Please!

JUDGE	The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
LOUIS	Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?

JUDGE	Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
LOUIS	Do I?

LOUIS	Your honor, may I approach the bench?
JUDGE	Yes.

LOUIS	Can I have some of your water?
JUDGE	Get on with it, counselor!
LOUIS	Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.

JUDGE	That's it?  That's all you have to say?
LOUIS	Did I forget something?

LOUIS	Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
SHERMAN	I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
LOUIS	Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
SHERMAN	I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
LOUIS	Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
SHERMAN	Like what?
LOUIS	I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
SHERMAN	You were the one who got me in.
LOUIS	I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
SHERMAN	Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
LOUIS	I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
SHERMAN	Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.

LOUIS	This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
SHERMAN	Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --

LOUIS	Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
SHERMAN	I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
LOUIS	I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.

VENKMAN	Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
MILTON	Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
VENKMAN	Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
MILTON	I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
VENKMAN	This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
MILTON	This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
VENKMAN	Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?

VENKMAN	Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
PROSECUTOR	Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.

PROSECUTOR	So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
VENKMAN	Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.

PROSECUTOR	I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
VENKMAN	I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
PROSECUTOR	So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
VENKMAN	No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.

VENKMAN	Egon!
SPENGLER	Hello, Venkman.
VENKMAN	How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
SPENGLER	I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
VENKMAN	I don't even want to know where that is.

SPENGLER	I'd like to have a stool specimen
VENKMAN	Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?

VENKMAN	What now, Brainiac?
SPENGLER	I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
VENKMAN	Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.

SPENGLER	That's a thousand million electron volts.
VENKMAN	I knew that.

SPENGLER	You were supposed to help me with this.
VENKMAN	You need the exercise.

SPENGLER	Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --
VENKMAN	A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.

VENKMAN	That's it?  "I'll be back?"
SPENGLER	It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.

SPENGLER	You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
VENKMAN	Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?

VENKMAN	Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
SPENGLER	This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.

SPENGLER	It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
VENKMAN	They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.

VENKMAN	So far so good.
SPENGLER	I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.

VENKMAN	Pretty impressive, huh?
SPENGLER	It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
VENKMAN	From where -- Neptune?
SPENGLER	They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
VENKMAN	Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.

SPENGLER	Who was that?
STANTZ	Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
SPENGLER	This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
STANTZ	You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
SPENGLER	Good idea.

STANTZ	Nothing.  Not a trace.
SPENGLER	Why don't we try the Giga-meter?

SPENGLER	The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
STANTZ	This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
SPENGLER	What's the reading?

STANTZ	Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
SPENGLER	His nickname is "The Hammer."

STANTZ	Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
SPENGLER	It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.

SPENGLER	I'm Egon --
STANTZ	And we're the ...

SPENGLER	No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
STANTZ	This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."

SPENGLER	Six feet -- seven -- eight --
STANTZ	That's it.  It's on the bottom.
SPENGLER	Nine feet -- ten --

SPENGLER	If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
STANTZ	Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.

SPENGLER	It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
STANTZ	I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
SPENGLER	We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --

STANTZ	Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
SPENGLER	Something good --

SPENGLER	Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
STANTZ	Do it!  Just do it!

SPENGLER	We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
WINSTON	You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?

SPENGLER	There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
WINSTON	I'd put my money on that Vigo character.

WINSTON	Is the line sinking?
SPENGLER	No, the slime is rising.

WINSTON	Rivers of the stuff!
SPENGLER	And it's all flowing toward the museum.

SPENGLER	Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
WINSTON	There's something very familiar about this painting.

VENKMAN	Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
STANTZ	Oh, hiya, Pete.
VENKMAN	So, no goat hooves, huh?
STANTZ	I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
VENKMAN	Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
STANTZ	Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.

VENKMAN	Great.  So what are you guys working on?
STANTZ	Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
VENKMAN	Who?
STANTZ	Who?  Just -- someone we know.
VENKMAN	Oh, Ray --

VENKMAN	Who?  Who?  Who?
STANTZ	Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
VENKMAN	Who, Ray?
STANTZ	Dana!  Dana Barrett!

VENKMAN	Well, Holmes, what do you think?
STANTZ	It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.

VENKMAN	What's that?
STANTZ	Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.

VENKMAN	I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
STANTZ	Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
VENKMAN	Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.

VENKMAN	Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
STANTZ	Okay, let's heat 'em up!

STANTZ	I'm Ray --
VENKMAN	I'm Peter --

STANTZ	Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
VENKMAN	Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
STANTZ	I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.

VENKMAN	You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
STANTZ	If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.

STANTZ	Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
VENKMAN	It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?

VENKMAN	And now you're going to eat it?
STANTZ	No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.

VENKMAN	This is what you do with your spare time?
STANTZ	This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
VENKMAN	'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.

STANTZ	Like a goat on garbage.
STANTZ	We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
VENKMAN	What kind of tests?
STANTZ	Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
VENKMAN	You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?

VENKMAN	Did you find anything at Dana's?
STANTZ	Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:

VENKMAN	Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
STANTZ	I'll get one more reading.

STANTZ	What happened?
VENKMAN	You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.

VENKMAN	Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
STANTZ	We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
VENKMAN	Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.

VENKMAN	I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
STANTZ	Okay, but you're missing all the fun.

STANTZ	You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
VENKMAN	Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
STANTZ	It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.

STANTZ	It looks like a giant Jello mold.
VENKMAN	I hate Jello.

STANTZ	Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
VENKMAN	Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?

STANTZ	I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
VENKMAN	Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?

STANTZ	I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
VENKMAN	Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.

STANTZ	I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
VENKMAN	We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.

STANTZ	My Fault!
VENKMAN	She's new in town.

STANTZ	Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
VENKMAN	The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.

VENKMAN	I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
STANTZ	Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.

STANTZ	My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
VENKMAN	Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?

STANTZ	What's your story, Pete?
VENKMAN	Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.

STANTZ	Ready?
WINSTON	I'm ready.
STANTZ	Then let's do it.

WINSTON	That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
STANTZ	Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.

WINSTON	Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
STANTZ	Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
WINSTON	Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
STANTZ	Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.

WINSTON	Does it have any favorites?
STANTZ	It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.

STANTZ	And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
WINSTON	I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.

WINSTON	You got a flux and a half.
STANTZ	Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."

WINSTON	Now that's one ugly dude.
STANTZ	Huh?  What?
WINSTON	You finished here?
STANTZ	What?  Yeah.
WINSTON	Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
STANTZ	No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.

STANTZ	Are you telling me how to drive?
WINSTON	No, I just thought --
STANTZ	Well don't think!

WINSTON	Are you all right?
STANTZ	Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.

WINSTON	Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
STANTZ	Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
WINSTON	You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
STANTZ	Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.

WINSTON	What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
STANTZ	Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.

STANTZ	She's moving!
WINSTON	I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.

WINSTON	Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
STANTZ	Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.

VENKMAN	I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
WINSTON	Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
VENKMAN	So we'll put a warning on the label.

WINSTON	Tell him about the toaster.
VENKMAN	I don't think he's ready for the toaster.

VENKMAN	It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
WINSTON	You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?

VENKMAN	And pure --
WINSTON	And decent.

VENKMAN	Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
WINSTON	Wonder what?
VENKMAN	If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.

WINSTON	How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
VENKMAN	It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.

WINSTON	My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
VENKMAN	Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.

BRIDE	Aren't you glad we waited?
GROOM	I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
BRIDE	Well, thanks a lot.

BRIDE	Roy?  Your clock broke.
GROOM	Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
BRIDE	I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!

BRIDE	Now where are you going?
GROOM	To the bathroom, where do you think?
BRIDE	Have I done the right thing?

BRIDE	Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
GROOM	Uuuuuuugh!!
BRIDE	What's the matter, dear?

COED	Is it a star?
VENKMAN	It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.

VENKMAN	Ready?  What is it?
COED	Ummm -- figure eight?
VENKMAN	Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
COED	No.  They're just coming to me.
VENKMAN	Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.

VENKMAN	Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
COED	Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
VENKMAN	Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.

VENKMAN	Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
COED	Eight o'clock?
VENKMAN	I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!

LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you ...
DANA	Hi, Louis.
LOUIS	... I thought it was the drug store.
DANA	Are you sick, Louis?

LOUIS	Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
DANA	No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
LOUIS	Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
DANA	Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
LOUIS	You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
DANA	I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.

LOUIS	Oh, Dana, it's you.
DANA	Hi, Louis.
LOUIS	Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
DANA	Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
LOUIS	Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
DANA	Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
LOUIS	I got the Twister game for later ...

LOUIS	Are you the Gatekeeper?
DANA	I am Zuul.

DANA	Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
LOUIS	I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
DANA	All right, what happened to me?

VENKMAN	Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
DANA	Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
VENKMAN	We're all professionals here, Miss ...
DANA	Barrett.  Dana Barrett.

DANA	... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
VENKMAN	So what do you think it was?

DANA	Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
VENKMAN	Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.

DANA	Is that your professional opinion?
VENKMAN	It's in the stars.

DANA	No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
VENKMAN	Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.

VENKMAN	Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
DANA	No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.

VENKMAN	You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
DANA	Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
VENKMAN	I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
DANA	That's a violin concerto.
VENKMAN	Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.

DANA	You really don't act like a scientist.
VENKMAN	No?  What do I act like?
DANA	Like a used car salesman.
VENKMAN	Thanks.  What's in there?

VENKMAN	That's too bad.
DANA	What?
VENKMAN	Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?

DANA	Uh-huh.
VENKMAN	Well, let's check it out.
DANA	I'll wait here if you don't mind.

VENKMAN	You're quite a housekeeper.
DANA	I told you, I ...
VENKMAN	I know.  It happened by itself.

VENKMAN	Damn!
DANA	Are you all right?
VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.

VENKMAN	There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
DANA	This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
VENKMAN	If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
DANA	Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
VENKMAN	I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
DANA	All right.  What do you want to do?
VENKMAN	I think I should spend the night here.
DANA	That's it.  Get out.
VENKMAN	On a purely scientific basis.
DANA	Out!
VENKMAN	I want to help you.
DANA	I'll scream.
VENKMAN	Don't scream.
DANA	Then leave.
VENKMAN	Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
DANA	All right.
VENKMAN	Okay.  Then I'll go.
DANA	Goodbye.
VENKMAN	No kiss?

VENKMAN	Great rehearsal.
DANA	You heard it?
VENKMAN	You're the best one in your row.
DANA	Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
VENKMAN	I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
DANA	I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
VENKMAN	Who's the stiff?
DANA	The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
VENKMAN	Is he dying or something?

DANA	He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
VENKMAN	Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
DANA	Can't you tell me now?
VENKMAN	I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
DANA	You must have gotten the last copy.
VENKMAN	Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
DANA	Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
VENKMAN	Gozer -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
DANA	What's he doing in my refrigerator.
VENKMAN	I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
DANA	I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
VENKMAN	You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
DANA	All right.  Since you put it that way.
VENKMAN	I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
DANA	I've got to go now.

VENKMAN	Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
DANA	I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.

DANA	We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
VENKMAN	Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
DANA	He is the Destructor.
VENKMAN	Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.

DANA	Do you want this body?
VENKMAN	Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
DANA	Take me now.

VENKMAN	Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
DANA	I want you inside me.
VENKMAN	I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
DANA	I am Zuul.  I am ...
VENKMAN	Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
DANA	There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
VENKMAN	Whoa!! Nice voice.

VENKMAN	Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
DANA	Really!  Is it gone?
VENKMAN	Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
DANA	Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.

VENKMAN	This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
DANA	Talk to my accountant. 

VENKMAN	I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
DEAN YAEGER	No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
VENKMAN	This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
DEAN YAEGER	Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
VENKMAN	But why?  The students love us!
DEAN YAEGER	Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
VENKMAN	I see.

SECOND BUM	That is one speedy mutt.
FIRST BUM	He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
SECOND BUM	Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.

FIRST BUM	Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
SECOND BUM	Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
FIRST BUM	You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
SECOND BUM	I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
FIRST BUM	That would definitely explain it.

HEAD LIBRARIAN	Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
VENKMAN	Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
HEAD LIBRARIAN	Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
VENKMAN	One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.

HEAD LIBRARIAN	What's that got to do with it?
VENKMAN	Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!

HEAD LIBRARIAN	Did you see it?  What was it?
VENKMAN	We'll get back to you.

JANINE	You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
SPENGLER	Print is dead.
JANINE	That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
SPENGLER	Is that a game?
JANINE	It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
SPENGLER	I collect spores, molds and fungus.
JANINE	Oh, that's very - unusual.
SPENGLER	I think it's the food of the future.
JANINE	Remind me not to go to lunch with you.

JANINE	Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
SPENGLER	Die in what sense?
JANINE	In the physical sense.
SPENGLER	I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
JANINE	That's so romantic.

JANINE	I want you to have this. 
SPENGLER	What is it?
JANINE	It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
SPENGLER	I don't believe in luck.
JANINE	Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
SPENGLER	Thank you.

VENKMAN	Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
JANINE	What calls?

VENKMAN	Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
JANINE	Here are tonight's calls.

JANINE	And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
VENKMAN	The EPA?  What's he want?
JANINE	I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
VENKMAN	Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
JANINE	Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.

MANAGER	Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
STANTZ	Has this ever happened before?
MANAGER	Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
STANTZ	Did you ever report it to anyone?
MANAGER	Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
STANTZ	Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.

VENKMAN	Can I help you?
PECK	I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
VENKMAN	Great!  How's it going?
PECK	Are you Peter Venkman?
VENKMAN	Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.

PECK	Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN	I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
PECK	I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
VENKMAN	You could say that.
PECK	And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN	I'm not at liberty to say.
PECK	And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
VENKMAN	In a storage facility.
PECK	And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
VENKMAN	Yes, it would.
PECK	And may I see this storage facility?
VENKMAN	No, you may not.
PECK	And why not, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN	Because you didn't say the magic word.
PECK	And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
VENKMAN	The magic word is "please."

PECK	May I please see the storage facility?
VENKMAN	Why do you want to see it?
PECK	Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
VENKMAN	Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
PECK	Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
VENKMAN	Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!

VENKMAN	At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
PECK	Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.

VENKMAN	You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
PECK	See!  They are using drugs.

VENKMAN	The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
PECK	Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...

VENKMAN	Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
PECK	That's "Peck!"
VENKMAN	... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.

VENKMAN	All right.  What is it?
SOPHOMORE	A square?
VENKMAN	Good guess -- but no.

SOPHOMORE	Circle?
VENKMAN	Close -- but definitely wrong.

VENKMAN	Nervous?
SOPHOMORE	Yes.  I don't like this.
VENKMAN	Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
SOPHOMORE	Two wavy lines?
VENKMAN	Sorry.  This isn't your day.

SOPHOMORE	Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
VENKMAN	You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
SOPHOMORE	Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
VENKMAN	I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
SOPHOMORE	I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
VENKMAN	Then my theory was correct.

STREET PUNK	Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
SPENGLER	They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
STREET PUNK	Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
SPENGLER	I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.

STREET PUNK	Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
SPENGLER	On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
STREET PUNK	Wow!

WOMAN	Yes?
SPENGLER	Were you recently in the bathroom?
WOMAN	What on earth gave you that idea?
SPENGLER	The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
WOMAN	You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
SPENGLER	When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?

SPENGLER	Oh!  You're here.
VENKMAN	What have you got, Egon?
SPENGLER	Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
VENKMAN	Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?

VENKMAN	Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
SPENGLER	I'm always serious.
VENKMAN	Wow!

SPENGLER	Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
VENKMAN	Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.

VENKMAN	Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
SPENGLER	She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.

SPENGLER	Did you see anything?
VENKMAN	Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.

SPENGLER	Something was definitely here.
VENKMAN	Yeah, I can smell it.

SPENGLER	Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
VENKMAN	What?
SPENGLER	Don't cross the beams.
VENKMAN	Why not?
SPENGLER	Trust me.  It will be bad.
VENKMAN	What do you mean "bad?"
SPENGLER	It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.

VENKMAN	It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
SPENGLER	What is it?
VENKMAN	I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
SPENGLER	Does she want to be?
VENKMAN	I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
SPENGLER	Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
VENKMAN	Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
SPENGLER	I agree.
VENKMAN	You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.

SPENGLER	All right.  I'll try.
VENKMAN	I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
SPENGLER	All right, Peter.  Good night.

SPENGLER	He wants to shut down the storage grid.
VENKMAN	If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.

VENKMAN	Where's the Keymaster?
SPENGLER	Oh, shit!

SPENGLER	Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
VENKMAN	Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
SPENGLER	Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
VENKMAN	She said he was "the Destructor."
SPENGLER	Who?
VENKMAN	Gozer.
SPENGLER	You talked to Gozer?
VENKMAN	Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.

VENKMAN	What now?
SPENGLER	Full-stream with strogon pulse.

VENKMAN	On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
SPENGLER	No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.

VENKMAN	No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
SPENGLER	Life is just a state of mind.
VENKMAN	But it's my favorite state.

STANTZ	You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
SPENGLER	Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.

STANTZ	I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
SPENGLER	I blame myself.

STANTZ	Sorry, Buddy!
SPENGLER	We'd better adjust our streams.

SPENGLER	Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
STANTZ	God, it's ugly!

STANTZ	It's working!
SPENGLER	Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.

STANTZ	Set entry grid.
SPENGLER	Neutronize.  System shut.

SPENGLER	I've got to sleep.
STANTZ	I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
SPENGLER	I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.

STANTZ	What happened??!!!?
SPENGLER	The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.

STANTZ	Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
SPENGLER	And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.

STANTZ	You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
SPENGLER	That appears to be the case.

VENKMAN	Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
STANTZ	Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
VENKMAN	Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
STANTZ	No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.

STANTZ	Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
VENKMAN	Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
STANTZ	What do you mean by "seen?"
VENKMAN	Looked at with your eyes.
STANTZ	Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
VENKMAN	Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.

STANTZ	What is it?
VENKMAN	It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.

STANTZ	I told you it's real.
VENKMAN	What do we do now?
STANTZ	I don't know.  Talk to it.
VENKMAN	What do I say?
STANTZ	Anything!  Just make contact.
VENKMAN	Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
STANTZ	Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.

VENKMAN	Get her?  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
STANTZ	I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
VENKMAN	Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.

VENKMAN	If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
STANTZ	If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
VENKMAN	Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.

STANTZ	You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
VENKMAN	Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.

STANTZ	This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
VENKMAN	You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
STANTZ	Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
VENKMAN	Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
STANTZ	For what purpose?
VENKMAN	To go into business for ourselves.

VENKMAN	You'll never regret this, Ray.
STANTZ	My parents left me that house, I was born there.
VENKMAN	You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
STANTZ	But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.

STANTZ	But most people are afraid to even report these things.
VENKMAN	Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.

STANTZ	Wow!  Does this pole still work?
VENKMAN	This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.

STANTZ	Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
VENKMAN	Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
STANTZ	Fourteen hundred.

STANTZ	Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
VENKMAN	Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?

STANTZ	How was your date?
VENKMAN	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.

STANTZ	They will.
VENKMAN	Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.

VENKMAN	So do I.
STANTZ	No sense worrying about it now.
VENKMAN	Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.

STANTZ	I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
VENKMAN	So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
STANTZ	All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.

VENKMAN	Ray -- Something's here.
STANTZ	Where are you, Pete?
VENKMAN	Third floor.  Get down here,
STANTZ	Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
VENKMAN	Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.

VENKMAN	It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
STANTZ	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
VENKMAN	How do you know?
STANTZ	I don't know.  I'm just guessing.

STANTZ	Boy, that was a rough one.
VENKMAN	I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.

VENKMAN	Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
STANTZ	It's not good, Pete.

VENKMAN	I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
STANTZ	No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
VENKMAN	Who was the architect?
STANTZ	He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.

VENKMAN	It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
STANTZ	I don't think it's Shandor.

STANTZ	As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
VENKMAN	Well, that ought to do it.

VENKMAN	Agile bastard, isn't he?
STANTZ	Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!

STANTZ	I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
VENKMAN	What?  What popped in there?
STANTZ	Look!

VENKMAN	AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
STANTZ	The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
VENKMAN	Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.

STANTZ	Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
WINSTON	Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.

WINSTON	Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
STANTZ	Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
WINSTON	Are you a Christian, Ray?
STANTZ	Mmmhmmm.
WINSTON	Me, too.
STANTZ	Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
WINSTON	Do you believe in God?
STANTZ	No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
WINSTON	Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
STANTZ	The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
WINSTON	Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
STANTZ	And the seas would boil ...
WINSTON	Right.  And the sky would fall ...
STANTZ	Judgement Day ...
WINSTON	Yeah, Judgement Day.
STANTZ	Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
WINSTON	Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?

STANTZ	You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
WINSTON	Right.  We'll believe anything.

WINSTON	Stantz?  You okay in there?
STANTZ	LATER, MAN!!

WINSTON	What's he talking about?  Choose what?
STANTZ	What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.

MOTHER	And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
FATHER	Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?

MOTHER	That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
FATHER	That is the wrong fork, young man.

MOTHER	Harold! Tell the boy again.
FATHER	No "buts." Go to your room now.
MOTHER	And?
FATHER	And think about what you've done.

MOTHER	Tell him, Harold.
FATHER	Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.

MOTHER	Tell him, Harold.
FATHER	It's going famously, son, famously!

FEMALE ROOMMATE	Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
LILA	Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!

FEMALE ROOMMATE	I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
LILA	It's embarrassing, okay?
FEMALE ROOMMATE	It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
LILA	Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
FEMALE ROOMMATE	Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
LILA	How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
FEMALE ROOMMATE	Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
LILA	Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
FEMALE ROOMMATE	You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.

GABRIELLE	Hello, my little boy.
PUFF	Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
GABRIELLE	Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
PUFF	Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.

GABRIELLE	Say my name.
PUFF	Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE	You remind me so much of Nathan.
PUFF	Like father, like son.
GABRIELLE	You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
PUFF	Woof.

PUFF	As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
GABRIELLE	Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union.  I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.

PUFF	Let's go eat, I'm starved.
GABRIELLE	French?
PUFF	Oui.

NATHAN	Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
GABRIELLE	Oui, doctor, oui.
NATHAN	Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
GABRIELLE	Oui.
NATHAN	You decide. Today is your day.
GABRIELLE	Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
NATHAN	Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
GABRIELLE	Oui. Perfect!
NATHAN	Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.

NATHAN	Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE	Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.

NATHAN	No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
GABRIELLE	Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
NATHAN	Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
GABRIELLE	Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
NATHAN	No. Don't be silly. It's just...
GABRIELLE	I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?

GABRIELLE	Thank you so much for accompanying me.
NATHAN	Not at all.
GABRIELLE	I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
NATHAN	Of course not.
GABRIELLE	You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?

NATHAN	Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE	I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?

GABRIELLE	Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
NATHAN	Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
GABRIELLE	Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
NATHAN	No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
GABRIELLE	Is everything fine?
NATHAN	Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
GABRIELLE	I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
NATHAN	I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?

GABRIELLE	Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
NATHAN	Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
GABRIELLE	I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
NATHAN	When you were a little French girl?
GABRIELLE	Oui.
NATHAN	That would be good.

GABRIELLE	Shall we close up, then?
NATHAN	Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
GABRIELLE	It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
NATHAN	Yes. Happy happy.
GABRIELLE	Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
NATHAN	I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.

GABRIELLE	I am sleepy.
NATHAN	I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
GABRIELLE	Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
NATHAN	Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
GABRIELLE	Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
NATHAN	It's true. I wouldn't lie.
GABRIELLE	You are sweet.

NATHAN	So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
GABRIELLE	Shh.

GABRIELLE	What is wrong, my darling?
NATHAN	Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.

GABRIELLE	Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
NATHAN	Shit.  Hi, honey.

NATHAN	Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
GABRIELLE	I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
NATHAN	You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
GABRIELLE	Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.

NATHAN	Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
GABRIELLE	Hmmmph.
NATHAN	Gabby, what is it?
GABRIELLE	Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
NATHAN	Fine.
GABRIELLE	Not in front of the boy.
NATHAN	Very well.

NATHAN	My little French.
GABRIELLE	Stop. Get away.
NATHAN	What is it?
GABRIELLE	You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
NATHAN	Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
GABRIELLE	No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.

NATHAN	I love you so much, Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE	But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
NATHAN	But I don't know how to leave Lila.

GABRIELLE	You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
NATHAN	Unnhh.
GABRIELLE	The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
NATHAN	Urgh.
GABRIELLE	Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!

GABRIELLE	Yeah? What?
NATHAN	Hi. It's Nathan.

GABRIELLE	Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
NATHAN	I just want to talk.
GABRIELLE	We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!

NATHAN	Please. Just one minute of your time.
GABRIELLE	Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
NATHAN	I've got some things to tell you.

GABRIELLE	Like what?
NATHAN	Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
GABRIELLE	What for?

NATHAN	Well, I think...
GABRIELLE	You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
NATHAN	What?
GABRIELLE	You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
NATHAN	Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you.

GABRIELLE	Well?
NATHAN	God, you're beautiful.
GABRIELLE	Please. I look a mess.
NATHAN	No. You look so beautiful.
GABRIELLE	Anyway. Come already to the point.
NATHAN	I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
GABRIELLE	I've moved on.
NATHAN	No!
GABRIELLE	I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
NATHAN	That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
GABRIELLE	That's not how he tells it.
NATHAN	Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE	Hunh.
NATHAN	Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
GABRIELLE	You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?

GABRIELLE	You were wonderful!
NATHAN	Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
GABRIELLE	Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."

GABRIELLE	So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
NATHAN	Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.

NATHAN	Lila?
GABRIELLE	That's Lila?

GABRIELLE	A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
NATHAN	I don't know. Something's missing.

GABRIELLE	Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
NATHAN	I don't know.

NATHAN	I want our boy back.
GABRIELLE	Oui.
NATHAN	That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
GABRIELLE	We still have you and I.
NATHAN	I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
GABRIELLE	Where do we look for little lost Puff?
NATHAN	I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
GABRIELLE	That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
NATHAN	You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!

NATHAN	I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
GABRIELLE	Okay, my sweet. Good night.
NATHAN	A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
GABRIELLE	Please let me go with you.
NATHAN	No.
GABRIELLE	Okay.

PUFF	My apologies, madam.
LILA	It's okay, Puff.
PUFF	Shan't happen again.

PUFF	It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
LILA	It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

LILA	Very well.
PUFF	Very well.

LILA	We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
PUFF	But I like being human now.

LILA	You what?
PUFF	I want to be the way I was before.
LILA	Good. I'll show you how, apey.

PUFF	Nice night.
LILA	Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.

LILA	You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
PUFF	What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.

LILA	He's dead.
PUFF	We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
LILA	No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
PUFF	Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
LILA	Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
PUFF	I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
LILA	No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
PUFF	Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
LILA	That's what I'm counting on.
PUFF	But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
LILA	Okay. If you think it will help.

ROSE	Progress!
LILA	Ouch. Yeah?
ROSE	Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
LILA	I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
ROSE	You still in the market for a real boy?
LILA	Always. Ow.
ROSE	Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
LILA	Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
ROSE	I don't get that. Is that sexual?
LILA	Shut up and tell me.
ROSE	Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
LILA	Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
ROSE	Loves animals. Loves you.
LILA	What do you mean?
ROSE	Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
LILA	Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
ROSE	My brother is discreet.
LILA	Won't he be able to tell?
ROSE	My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
LILA	God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
ROSE	Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.

ROSE	So?
LILA	I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
ROSE	My brother says he likes you, too.
LILA	Really?
ROSE	Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother.

ROSE	My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
LILA	I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
ROSE	Yeah?
LILA	He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
ROSE	Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
LILA	One night stand?
ROSE	No. I married a midget.
LILA	Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
ROSE	Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
LILA	I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
ROSE	Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
LILA	I have a friend you might like to meet.
ROSE	Oh?
LILA	Three foot one.
ROSE	Be still my crotch.
LILA	Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
ROSE	Yeah. My brother told me.
LILA	And I think I'm going to.
ROSE	Stand on a stepladder sometimes.

LILA	No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
ROSE	Lila, it's Rosie.
LILA	Go the fuck away, Rosie.
ROSE	Please, honey, let me in.
LILA	Rose, please go away.
ROSE	Lila, I want to help you.

LILA	How'd you know where I was?
ROSE	Nathan told my brother.
LILA	Your brother should have his license revoked.
ROSE	Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
LILA	Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?

ROSE	I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
LILA	Oh, Rosie.
ROSE	Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.

ROSE	Done!
LILA	Ready!

LILA	Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
ROSE	With pleasure.

ROSE	I'm going to miss you.
LILA	Oh, Rosie.
ROSE	And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
LILA	Shut up, you.

ROSE	I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
LILA	I'm really glad you two found each other.

LILA	I'll be in touch.
ROSE	No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.

NATHAN	Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
LILA	Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
NATHAN	As do I.
LILA	They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
NATHAN	They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
LILA	You've got to respect that.
NATHAN	I have to say that I'm not there yet.
LILA	Where?
NATHAN	Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
LILA	That's not necessarily a bad thing.
NATHAN	Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
LILA	I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
NATHAN	I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
LILA	You are a therapist, right?
NATHAN	No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
LILA	I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
NATHAN	Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
LILA	How's it going?
NATHAN	Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
LILA	Paper or cloth?
NATHAN	I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
LILA	What's the larger experiment?
NATHAN	It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
LILA	Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
NATHAN	The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
LILA	I'm not sure.
NATHAN	Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
LILA	We are animals after all.
NATHAN	Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world.

LILA	It looks wonderful.
NATHAN	You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...

LILA	Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
NATHAN	My God! The fork! The fork!
LILA	I'm sorry?
NATHAN	Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
LILA	Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
NATHAN	No biggie.

LILA	Boy, this is good!
NATHAN	I'm sorry that I became so upset.
LILA	No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
NATHAN	It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
LILA	You do?
NATHAN	Yes, and...
LILA	You really enjoy my company?
NATHAN	Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.

NATHAN	It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
LILA	I like you, too, Nathan.
NATHAN	You do?
LILA	Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
NATHAN	I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?

NATHAN	Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
LILA	Nathan!

NATHAN	What are you doing in there?
LILA	I'll be out in a minute.
NATHAN	I'm sorry about my parents.
LILA	You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
NATHAN	I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
LILA	Do you?
NATHAN	Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.

LILA	Do you? Oh do you, darling?
NATHAN	Why certainly!

LILA	Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
NATHAN	That's a great idea.

LILA	It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
NATHAN	Terrific. Can't wait!

NATHAN	Shaving cream?
LILA	I don't think so.  Why?

NATHAN	Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
LILA	Yes, darling.
NATHAN	Oh, and the sun block?
LILA	Of course.
NATHAN	What SPF, sweetie?
LILA	Fifteen.
NATHAN	Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
LILA	Yes, darling.
NATHAN	I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
LILA	Yes.
NATHAN	Flares?
LILA	Absolutely.
NATHAN	We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
LILA	That's very funny.
NATHAN	I love you so much.

LILA	Did you see that?
NATHAN	What?
LILA	I don't know. Something.
NATHAN	A deer?
LILA	No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
NATHAN	It might behoove us to turn back at this point.

LILA	Come on.
NATHAN	If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.

NATHAN	You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
LILA	I think he's feral.
NATHAN	Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
LILA	He looks perfectly fine.
NATHAN	I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
LILA	I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
NATHAN	Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
LILA	What?
NATHAN	Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
LILA	Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
NATHAN	It's perfect!
LILA	Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
NATHAN	Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
LILA	Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
NATHAN	Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
LILA	I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
NATHAN	Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
LILA	You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
NATHAN	Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.

NATHAN	...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
LILA	All right.
NATHAN	Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk.

NATHAN	What are you doing in there?
LILA	Nothing. Be right out.

LILA	Who is it?
NATHAN	Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.

LILA	Who is it?
NATHAN	Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.

LILA	Who from work?
NATHAN	Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?

LILA	It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
NATHAN	Your entire body?
LILA	I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
NATHAN	You have to shave? Like an ape?
LILA	Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
NATHAN	Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
LILA	I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
NATHAN	Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
LILA	I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
NATHAN	I have to think! I have to think!

NATHAN	Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
LILA	You are an animal.
NATHAN	Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
LILA	I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
NATHAN	I'm glad you're female.  Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene?

LILA	So, how's it going today?
NATHAN	Good. Making progress.
LILA	Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.

NATHAN	Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
LILA	Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.

LILA	Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
NATHAN	Of course not.
LILA	It would just be helpful to know.
NATHAN	No.
LILA	Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
NATHAN	I'm just preoccupied.
LILA	Do you like my new look?
NATHAN	Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
LILA	I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
NATHAN	Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
LILA	Really?
NATHAN	Sure. Of course.
LILA	Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
NATHAN	That's great.
LILA	I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!

NATHAN	That's great. It's a great color for you.
LILA	Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!

LILA	Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
NATHAN	...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
LILA	You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
NATHAN	Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
LILA	I'll make it.  I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right?  Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink.  Voila!

LILA	How's work?
NATHAN	Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
LILA	No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
NATHAN	My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
LILA	Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
NATHAN	I guess.

LILA	Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
NATHAN	Have you?
LILA	Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
NATHAN	Really?
LILA	Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
NATHAN	How come?
LILA	Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
NATHAN	Such as what womanly things?
LILA	Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
LILA	I had sold my fucking soul.
NATHAN	I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.

NATHAN	Bravo to you, Puff!
LILA	That was wonderful!

NATHAN	I think he's ready.
LILA	Oh boy!

LILA	You just have to control it. We're not apes.
NATHAN	Thank you very much for that.

NATHAN	Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
LILA	Absolutely!

NATHAN	I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
LILA	Should I come with?
NATHAN	Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
LILA	Ummm. It's good.

LILA	You were gone a long time.
NATHAN	Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
LILA	So he's doing okay?
NATHAN	Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
LILA	That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
NATHAN	Shit.
LILA	And what did you do tonight, honey?
NATHAN	I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
LILA	And what did you do tonight, honey?
NATHAN	I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
LILA	Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
NATHAN	Yes.
LILA	I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
NATHAN	Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
LILA	How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
NATHAN	Lila...

LILA	Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
NATHAN	Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
LILA	Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.

NATHAN	Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
LILA	Ugnh.

NATHAN	Look at you two. You both disgust me.
LILA	Oook. Oook.
NATHAN	Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
LILA	Ooka.
NATHAN	Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.

PUFF	Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
NATHAN	Bravo, Puff! Bravo!

PUFF	Oh boy!
NATHAN	Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
PUFF	Okay. That's fair.

NATHAN	This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
PUFF	I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.

PUFF	I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
NATHAN	Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
PUFF	I bow to your expertise in these matters.
NATHAN	Lila?

NATHAN	Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
PUFF	Yahoo!
NATHAN	Tomorrow, the acid test.

PUFF	Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
NATHAN	And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
PUFF	Extra dessert?
NATHAN	Even better.

NATHAN	Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
PUFF	It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
NATHAN	I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
PUFF	Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
NATHAN	Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
PUFF	Got it.

NATHAN	Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
PUFF	It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...

PUFF	Thanks to you, Nate.
NATHAN	Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.

NATHAN	And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
PUFF	here, here.

PUFF	Interesting.
NATHAN	Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?

PUFF	Ugnh.
NATHAN	Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
PUFF	Unn.
NATHAN	Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.

NATHAN	Puff, put the gun down.
PUFF	Ounpoo. Ungh.
NATHAN	Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
PUFF	Unka unka unka unka unka.
NATHAN	Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
PUFF	I have to talk. Is that okay?

PUFF	You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
NATHAN	No.

NATHAN	So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
WENDALL	Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
NATHAN	No, why?
WENDALL	Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
NATHAN	Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
WENDALL	I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
NATHAN	I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
WENDALL	And how do you feel about Gabrielle?

OLDER WOMAN	Wait!
PUFF	Yes?
OLDER WOMAN	I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.

PUFF	Mother?
OLDER WOMAN	Yes... Derek.

PUFF	It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
OLDER WOMAN	Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
PUFF	Yes.
OLDER WOMAN	I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
PUFF	I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.

AL	I said something.
JOE	I know you did!

AL	No, not her. Me.
JOE	Who's you?

AL	My name is AL.
JOE	Al ???!!!

JOE	Where are you,...Al?
AL	You're not gonna believe this...
JOE	Try me.
AL	I'm...inside you.

JOE	I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
AL	What's going on?

JOE	...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
AL	Don't do that.
JOE	Why not.

JOE	Arrrgh!
AL	It wasn't him.
JOE	Who was it?
AL	Me.
JOE	Who?
AL	Al.

JOE	Al.
AL	Yes?
JOE	This candid camera?

JOE	You're in my head...
AL	Yes.
JOE	Your name is Al...
AL	Yes.
JOE	I see...

JOE	No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
AL	What is your name?
JOE	You're in my head? You don't know my name?
AL	I just got here.
JOE	What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
AL	Where are we?
JOE	Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
AL	What street?
JOE	What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
AL	Why don't we go home?
JOE	Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
AL	...I need to make a phone call.
JOE	Do me a favor, Al.
AL	Yeah?
JOE	Shut up!

JOE	Somebody's been here.
AL	Where are we now?
JOE	My place, can't you see?
AL	No.
JOE	You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
AL	Right.
JOE	Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
AL	I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
JOE	Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.

AL	Who are you?
JOE	Who am I?
AL	Yeah...Who?
JOE	Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!

AL	Quit screwing around, this is important.
JOE	It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
AL	I told you, my name is Al.
JOE	What are you doing in my head, Al?

AL	You've heard of the PEM114...
JOE	That a new Datsun?

JOE	Are you threatening me?
AL	I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.

AL	Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
JOE	Me? What'd I do?
AL	Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
JOE	I don't know what you're talking about.
AL	The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
JOE	No.
AL	You've heard of U.S.T.?
JOE	I just went there for a job.
AL	Then how'd I get here?

AL	I know...it sounds insane.
JOE	You said it.

AL	What are you doing?
JOE	Loading a gun.
AL	What for?
JOE	Kill myself.
AL	Are you crazy?
JOE	Yep.
AL	Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
JOE	Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
AL	You're not crazy.
JOE	Hear voices don't I.
AL	Of course you do!
JOE	Then I'm crazy.

AL	You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
JOE	You're gonna explain.
AL	Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
AL	Yeah.
JOE	Why he's argumentative?
AL	Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.

AL	You'll be alive.
JOE	With a man in my head...
AL	Yeah.

AL	What was that?
JOE	Who was that? Somebody out there?

AL	You weren't listening!
JOE	Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
AL	Why don't you?

AL	No they won't.
JOE	Why not?
AL	I'll talk to them.
JOE	Oh...Gooood!
AL	I'll tell you what to say.
JOE	If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
AL	If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.

AL	Anyone there?
JOE	No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.

AL	Behind us?
JOE	Still clear. Just a motorcycle.

AL	What's that?
JOE	Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.

AL	What'd he look like?
JOE	He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.

JOE	What do I do?
AL	Outrun them.
JOE	This is a Fiesta!

JOE	Now what?
AL	Whatever you do, just...don't stop.

JOE	I wouldn't say that.
AL	Then what are you stopping for?

AL	Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
JOE	Can't see a Goddamn thi..

JOE	I want out.
AL	Too late...They want you.
JOE	Why? AL  You know too much.
JOE	I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
AL	You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?

AL	Calm Down! Act rational.
JOE	How do you act when someone trys to kill you?

JOE	I don't know...To get Al.
AL	No. Don't tell the guards.

AL	Did you hear that?
JOE	Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!

AL	It can't take that long.
JOE	Why?

JOE	JOE Or what?
AL	I don't know. I don't want to find out.

JOE	They could put you back in the tube..
AL	I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
JOE	Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
AL	They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
JOE	Yeah...Who is?
AL	I am. You are.
JOE	You are CRAZY!
AL	You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
JOE	What do you mean we.
AL	You gotta help.
JOE	I did. I brought you back here.
AL	We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
JOE	Thanks.
AL	Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
JOE	I'm not leaving until you do.

AL	Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
JOE	Find You?
AL	I'm not gonna make it easy.

AL	They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
JOE	Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.

AL	Sue them.
JOE	I'll sue.

JOE	I don't like the sound of that.
AL	We have to get out of here.
JOE	Door's locked.
AL	See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993

JOE	Now what.
AL	Go out, take your first left.
JOE	Just walk down the hall?
AL	With Authority!

JOE	Which way do I go?
AL	What does it say.
JOE	Corridor A.
AL	Take a left and your next right.
JOE	Where are we going?

JOE	A lab and equipment.
AL	Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
JOE	I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
AL	Who did?
JOE	The man.

AL	Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
JOE	I can't remember..

JOE	Like the guys that attacked us.
AL	What do you mean?
JOE	Black suits and helmets.
AL	That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
JOE	That's not a good idea.
AL	They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
JOE	Gone where?
AL	Don't know.

JOE	You need ID in there?
AL	You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
JOE	I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
AL	You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.

AL	Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
JOE	Nothing!

AL	Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
JOE	Just scratched my arm, why?
AL	I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
JOE	The airport! Hey, wait a minute.

AL	I'm back.
JOE	I'm at the airport.
AL	Good. Get to a phone.

JOE	Who is it?
AL	Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.

AL	Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
JOE	What am I supposed to do?
AL	Nothing. You just do nothing.

JOE	What is it?
AL	Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...

JOE	What do we do?
AL	Send a man there. A secret agent.
JOE	Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
AL	You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...

JOE	You mean...just leave.
AL	We get on a plane.
JOE	We get on which plane?

JOE	What about money?
AL	What about it?
JOE	I don't have any.
AL	Use my credit cards.
JOE	I can't do that.
AL	Why not?
JOE	It's illegal.
AL	Who cares?
JOE	I'll get in trouble.
AL	You are in trouble. Now do it.

JOE	...and a license to kill...
AL	Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.

JOE	They'll know who I am.
AL	We'll change your appearance.

JOE	It's just not enough.
AL	It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
JOE	What's wrong with how I carry myself.
AL	Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
JOE	Oh yeah, to what?
AL	You'll be me.
JOE	I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
AL	Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
JOE	You leave my glands alone!

JOE	Now what?
AL	The beach.
JOE	The beach?
AL	How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
JOE	Eating sushi?
AL	Just get there.

JOE	Holy shit!
AL	What is it?
JOE	...Just beautiful.

AL	Do you notice anything.
JOE	The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
AL	Swim.
JOE	Good Idea!

AL	Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
JOE	Little late for that.

JOE	Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
AL	You eat it.
JOE	You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
AL	I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.

JOE	Now what?
AL	The sand.
JOE	Eat it?
AL	Eat it.
JOE	I don't want to eat it.
AL	Why not?
JOE	It's sand.
AL	For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!

AL	Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
JOE	Where are you going? Wait!

JOE	Al, are you doing anything in there?
AL	What? What do you mean?
JOE	Are you screwing with any nerves?

JOE	Beautiful!
AL	What was?
JOE	A girl.

JOE	This must be business, there's nothing else here.
AL	Follow it.

JOE	She's...pretty fast.
AL	You're out of shape.

AL	What is it?
JOE	She's beautiful...! What do I do?

JOE	You're beautiful..
AL	What's happening?
JOE	She doesn't seem to understand.
AL	Try another language.
JOE	Which language?
AL	How should I know?

JOE	Help me out, will you?
AL	What can I do? You're on your own.

JOE	What do I do?
AL	Don't just stand there, say something.
JOE	What?
AL	Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.

AL	.
JOE	.

AL	Wait.
JOE	Wait.

AL	Where is she staying?
JOE	Where are you staying?

AL	Touch her.
JOE	What?
AL	Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.

JOE	...Joe.
AL	No...you idiot!

AL	What happened?
JOE	...Rene...

AL	Where are you going?
JOE	To the hotel. To register.
AL	Without your pants.
JOE	Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.

AL	Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
JOE	Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
AL	It worked.
JOE	I made it work.
AL	You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
JOE	Rene...
JOE	I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
AL	Well you did it today.
JOE	Yeah. I did it.
AL	But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.

JOE	Now, where would I be?
AL	What are you looking at?

AL	But what's it look like?
JOE	What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
AL	Is something glinting?

JOE	What is it?
AL	Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!

AL	You really like that shirt?
JOE	This...is not going to work out.

AL	Much too blue.
JOE	Not blue enough.

JOE	Mind your own business.
AL	It is my business. It's my name.
JOE	But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.

AL	Not that tie with that coat.
JOE	Why not?!

AL	What did that cost?
JOE	You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
AL	Doesn't.

AL	Which one is she?
JOE	The beautiful one.

AL	They both look good to me.
JOE	You have no taste.

AL	Get close to them.
JOE	That place. By the window.

AL	You're not just after this girl, are you?
JOE	Who, me?

JOE	You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
AL	Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
JOE	That's a big if.

AL	Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
JOE	What glasses.
AL	The drinks...Stay on them.

AL	Follow that busboy.
JOE	Are you serious?

JOE	I feel like an idiot.
AL	Just hold them close and stay still.

JOE	Which one?
AL	The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
JOE	Killer!

AL	Just don't show fear.
JOE	I don't know what's going on.
AL	It lends you an air of mystery.

AL	He recognises you, throw him off.
JOE	My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
AL	Don't get too cute.

AL	Joe, be careful!
JOE	...I've lost something. I must get it back.

AL	They're all in it.
JOE	How do you know?
AL	Voice stress analyzer.
JOE	Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.

JOE	Even Rene?
AL	She's the toughest to read.
JOE	Maybe she's telling the truth.
AL	Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
JOE	Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...

AL	What is it, your charm?
JOE	This just won't work.
AL	You're doing great with her.
JOE	Not her. You!
AL	What is it?
JOE	You can't listen. You can't watch either.

JOE	It's embarrassing.
AL	What if she says something important?
JOE	I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
AL	What am I supposed to do?
JOE	You got any books in there?
AL	Oh come on.
JOE	You shut down your sensors.
AL	Joe! It's 56 hours!
JOE	I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.

AL	What Happened?
JOE	I don't know!
AL	What she say. What'd you get out of her?

JOE	Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
AL	Is that all?
JOE	Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.

JOE	She's got the most beautiful...s
AL	Shit! You're in love.

AL	And on my time.
JOE	It's not your time. I get time off.
AL	You get time off to sleep.

JOE	No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
JOE	No. What will you do.
AL	I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do!

AL	You been had. We have.
JOE	It wasn't like that.

AL	Some agent you are.
JOE	Why don't you get out of my face.

AL	Bingo.
JOE	You found her.
AL	Better. I found Ryuji.
JOE	That's good. It's not better. Where?
AL	Osaka.
JOE	Osaka?
AL	Fountainhead of High-Tech.

JOE	Don't you think I stand out like this.
AL	We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
JOE	I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........

JOE	What do I do?
AL	Follow her.
JOE	On what?
AL	Run, stupid!

AL	Come on, she's getting away.
JOE	I can't keep up.

JOE	Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
AL	That's not funny.

JOE	Sapporo..
AL	Just stay here and rest.
JOE	Where are you going?
AL	Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
JOE	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...

AL	`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
JOE	What do I do?
AL	Relax. Let me do this.

AL	Relax. Make your mind a blank.
JOE	It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.

AL	What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
JOE	You think. That's what you're good at.

AL	Yeah...You've fallen for her.
JOE	I told you, I have a feeling...
AL	One of your instincts?
JOE	I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.

AL	Don't touch a thing.
JOE	Don't worry!

AL	...drink it.
JOE	Too late.

JOE	What next!
AL	Drink lots of water.

JOE	I can't...
AL	You have to! Quickly!
JOE	...imagine a better grape for the region.

JOE	What are you doing?
AL	Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.

JOE	Ow!
AL	A hard left. A hard left.

AL	Door to the right. Get up and run.
JOE	I can't see a thing.
AL	Neither can they.

JOE	What?
AL	Never mind, just say it.

AL	He was with Gruner!
JOE	You were with GRUNER!

JOE	I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
AL	No. You can't trust her.

AL	Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
JOE	Probably.
AL	I don't trust her.
JOE	Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...

AL	It's him.
JOE	Come on.

AL	Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
AL	I've got an idea.
JOE	I was afraid of that.

JOE	You sure this will work?
AL	Not sure at all.
JOE	Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
AL	Just say the words. Just like I told you.

JOE	What was it? What'd I say?
AL	You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.

AL	haka xuki.
JOE	haka xuki. What's that mean?
AL	Cash.

AL	Left...The one with the red dot.
JOE	Well...?
AL	It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.

JOE	He hung us up dry.
AL	While he makes the run.
JOE	Where?

AL	It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
JOE	And Dieter?
AL	He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.

JOE	Then, why'd he lead us here.
AL	He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.

AL	Do it.
JOE	I can't handle that thing.
AL	Don't worry, I can.

AL	Are you alright?
JOE	Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.

AL	Aim just in front of his face.
JOE	Aim what?

JOE	Holy...
AL	...Shit! It's just money.

JOE	He aready made the deal..
AL	The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
JOE	Dieter!
AL	GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.

JOE	There's a lot you don't know.
AL	And don't let her know, either.

AL	This may hurt.
JOE	Well, don't let it. What are you doing?

JOE	Pretty advanced, isn't it?
AL	Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.

JOE	Do something.
AL	What exactly?
JOE	I don't know.

JOE	What happened?
AL	Losing power. The laser drained it.

AL	Be quiet.
JOE	Where've you been?
AL	Never mind that, where are we now.
JOE	We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
AL	Gimme a minute.
JOE	Looks like you can have all you want.

JOE	I can always flush you down the toilet.
AL	Keep thinking.
JOE	I have been... I think you're right.
AL	About what?
JOE	Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
AL	Rene?
JOE	She works for them.
AL	Now, you're too suspicious.
JOE	You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
AL	I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
JOE	No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.

AL	She is beautiful.
JOE	You've changed your mind.

AL	Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
AL	Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
JOE	Oh no!

AL	I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
AL	She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
JOE	They can?

AL	You're a lucky man.
JOE	Yeah, sure.

AL	She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
JOE	You're lovely.

JOE	I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
AL	I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
JOE	I want to thank you for what you've done.

JOE	Awwww...
AL	I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.

AL	Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
JOE	I'll get us out of here.
AL	Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....

AL	In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE	That's nice.

JOE	What are you doing?
AL	Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.

OUTSIDE -	JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
AL	GO-TOE. It's some islands.
OUTSIDE -	JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
AL	It's all we've got.

OUTSIDE -	JOE What abilities...?
AL	Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.

AL	I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
OUTSIDE -	JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
AL	Some friend you are! You know what I hope?

AL	You just got a Mickey.
OUTSIDE -	RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.

AL	Not that truth!
RENE	Aren't we all.

AL	Sorry...
RENE	It'll remind me of you.
AL	Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.

AL	Doesn't matter.
RENE	What part what?
AL	The best part. She'll love it.

RENE	I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
AL	Do what? What'd you do?

RENE	What is your name?
AL	Don't give her your name.

AL	No!
RENE	Oh, I can't.
AL	Good.

AL	We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
RENE	Dieter?

AL	I'm against it.
RENE	I insist.

RENE	Can you fly this?
AL	Don't worry.

RENE	I'm...scared.
AL	Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.

RENE	I didn't do anything.
AL	I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.

RENE	Nice?
AL	In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you.

AL	What kind of a deal?
RENE	Let us get to the border!
AL	Then what?

AL	I knew you were trouble.
RENE	Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.

RENE	What happened?
BURR	Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
RENE	In him?
BURR	It's a long story.
RENE	ya hyutn slulptsa?

BURR	They have stolen state property.
RENE	What a nerve!

DIETER	I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
BURR	Rene?
DIETER	She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.

BURR	Impossible.
DIETER	I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.

DIETER	If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
BURR	Who's our little man?
DIETER	Me.
BURR	No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
DIETER	I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.

BURR	You didn't tell us you were coming?
JOE	Then how did you know?

BURR	You've cut your hair?
JOE	I dyed it. We're all getting old.

JOE	PEM115!
BURR	**?!! 
JOE	Newer, more powerful design.

JOE	How about a deal?
BURR	We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.

COLIN	Surveillance Cameras?
FINNEGAN	They took the tapes.
COLIN	You have nothing...
FINNEGAN	We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?

COLIN	We'll have to let them go.
FINNEGAN	Surveilliance on them all.

FINNEGAN	Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
COLIN	He work for us?
FINNEGAN	Ah...no sir. He was here for a job interview.

FINNEGAN	What Job?
COLIN	Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
FINNEGAN	Sir?
COLIN	Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
FINNEGAN	Bit expensive, sir.
COLIN	It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.

DIETER	Who is your friend?
RENE	We met on the beach.
DIETER	Join us.

DIETER	What are you doing here, where've you been?
RENE	I have a new client.
DIETER	That crazy guy?
RENE	Yes. Joe.

DIETER	Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
RENE	It's just money.
DIETER	Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.

DIETER	Yes?
RENE	He's not an ordinary man.
DIETER	Enough ROmance.
RENE	He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!

JOE	I don't want to intrude.
DIETER	We insist.

JOE	Al Viola.
DIETER	That name's familiar.
JOE	It is to me too.
DIETER	You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?

JOE	...Foreign service.
DIETER	And how do you service foreigners.
JOE	Well...I try to give them whatever they want.

DIETER	What brings you here?
JOE	I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.

DIETER	And...you know Jan Gruner?
JOE	I think I've heard of you.

FINNEGAN	Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
JOE	What?
FINNEGAN	Your memory.
JOE	What about it?
FINNEGAN	It may have been affected.
JOE	Oh.
FINNEGAN	You may not remember things.
JOE	What things?
FINNEGAN	I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
JOE	Oh...that's okay.
FINNEGAN	When you do...
JOE	Do what?
FINNEGAN	When you remember...
JOE	Remember what?
FINNEGAN	Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
JOE	Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
FINNEGAN	Right.
JOE	Who...are you?
FINNEGAN	Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
JOE	How do I look?
FINNEGAN	Fine. You look fine.
JOE	Thanks.
FINNEGAN	Well...
JOE	Well what?
FINNEGAN	We're here.
JOE	Here?
FINNEGAN	Home. Your home. The address on your form.
JOE	Oh.
FINNEGAN	Don't you want to get out?
JOE	Oh....Sure.
FINNEGAN	Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
JOE	I feel fine.
FINNEGAN	You'll feel better
JOE	I will?
FINNEGAN	Look, we'll bring your car home. just take it easy until the effects wear off. You need anything, just call this number.

FINNEGAN	Joe.
JOE	What?
FINNEGAN	Take the card.
JOE	Oh yeah, thanks...

FINNEGAN	Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
JOE	No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
FINNEGAN	Why would we want to hurt you?
JOE	Not you. Them.
FINNEGAN	Who?
JOE	I don't know Who.

FINNEGAN	Al?
JOE	The little man in my...  ...head...

JOE	I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
FINNEGAN	Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.

JOE	Ahhh...nothing.
FINNEGAN	Been complaning of hallucinations.
JOE	Not...complaining, actually.
FINNEGAN	Been hearing voices.

FINNEGAN	Was quite excited, when he came in...
JOE	Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...

FINNEGAN	Sue who?
JOE	You...him...UST.

JOE	That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
GRUNER	I noticed you staring.
JOE	Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?

GRUNER	And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
JOE	A little voice in my head.

GRUNER	You may you find all the solitude you want.
JOE	Thanks, I appreciate that.

JOE	Don't do it!
GRUNER	Just give me the keys.
JOE	Whatever it is, don't do it.

JOE	How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
WAITER	Sir?

JOE	How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
WAITER	We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
JOE	This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card.

JOE	Now you know what I know.
WAITER	Sir?

JOE	About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
WAITER	Ahhh. Good choice, sir.

JOE	The fresh tuna?..
WAITER	Yessir...very good sir.

JOE	Yes...What is it?
WOMAN	What's what?
JOE	What do you want?
WOMAN	Nothing.
JOE	What did you say?
WOMAN	Nothing.
JOE	What?
WOMAN	I said...I didn't say..anything!
JOE	Then who did?
WOMAN	You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.

JOE	Oh...and who is it!?
WOMAN	I didn't say anything.

RENE	What do you do about what?
JOE	...I'm looking for someone.

RENE	Is someone else here?
JOE	No. No one to speak of.
RENE	I am confused. Or maybe it's you.

JOE	...Blake
RENE	Blake?
JOE	The poet...something he said...
RENE	Yes?

RENE	Blake said that?
JOE	Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.

JOE	I'll be right there.
RENE	Where?
JOE	Dinner...tonight.
RENE	Oh...I can't. Business.

RENE	And you.
JOE	...right here too.
RENE	Haven't seen you around.

JOE	I can't do that?
RENE	Do what?
JOE	Let you leave without it.
RENE	Without what?

JOE	What's so funny?
RENE	Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
JOE	What way?
RENE	Like there's someone else here.

JOE	Wait. What's your name?
RENE	...Rene.

RENE	You mean from it.
JOE	Yes, of course.

JOE	And you?
RENE	I just work for the travel firm.

RENE	You again.
JOE	Me still. They left you alone?
RENE	I waited for you.
JOE	Why?
RENE	...I...don't know.

RENE	I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
JOE	It's not apparent.
RENE	...and sort of...disinterest.
JOE	Disinterest?
RENE	As if your mind's not all there.
JOE	I am sort of scattered.
RENE	Can I help?
JOE	You are.
RENE	Are you alright?

JOE	Promise you what?
RENE	That you're not crazy.
JOE	I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
RENE	You talk to yourself.
JOE	But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
RENE	Why do you do it?
JOE	If I was with you, I wouldn't
RENE	You did.
JOE	That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
RENE	You're talking to me.
JOE	And how'm I doing?
RENE	You're doing...Okay.
JOE	Just Okay...

RENE	...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
JOE	...Naw. Made that up.
RENE	Who do you work for?
JOE	No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
RENE	Trans Ocean Travel.
JOE	Is that Ryuji?
RENE	No. Ryuji just hires us.
JOE	Hires you for what?
RENE	To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
JOE	How often they come here?
RENE	He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
JOE	And you, what do you like?
RENE	That depends...

RENE	Joe! What happened to you?
JOE	Why'd you run off?

JOE	Why did you leave?
RENE	They left. I had to go with them.
JOE	Why didn't you tell me?

JOE	Why did you stay with me?
RENE	Wanted to get to know you.
JOE	Why?
RENE	You seemed interesting.
JOE	Who else is interested in me?
RENE	What do you mean?
JOE	Your friends, did they ask about me?
RENE	They kidded me a little.
JOE	What did you tell them?
RENE	There's not much to tell.
JOE	Why did they leave?
RENE	I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
JOE	You work for Ryuji?
RENE	Sometimes. I told you I did.
JOE	Were you working for him last night?
RENE	Last night?
JOE	Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
RENE	No, he didn't do that.
JOE	He didn't.
RENE	No.
JOE	Who did?
RENE	You did.

RENE	I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
JOE	This is a tough place to keep Kosher.

RENE	You're leaving.
JOE	Food doesn't agree with me.
RENE	I'm leaving too.
JOE	Why?
RENE	This business is over.
JOE	I'm sorry. What will you do?
RENE	Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
JOE	I'm just on vacation.
RENE	Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?

JOE	You know where he went?
RENE	What's he done?
JOE	He stole something. From a friend of mine.
RENE	He must be a good friend.
JOE	We're very close.
RENE	What'd he steal?
JOE	A chip. Goes in a computer.
RENE	One chip?
JOE	The most important one. Can you help me find him?
RENE	How do you know you can trust me?
JOE	Got to trust someone.

RENE	I don't know. He mentioned a city.
JOE	What is it?
RENE	Hiroshima.
JOE	Get your things.

JOE	You don't believe me.
RENE	Oh sure.
JOE	Then why are you smiling like that?
RENE	Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
JOE	You think I'm like that?

JOE	What's Gruner like?
RENE	They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
JOE	Who was?
RENE	Ryuji and Gruner.
JOE	And Dieter.
RENE	Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
JOE	And you?
RENE	It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.

RENE	Where we going?
JOE	Beats me.

RENE	This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
JOE	Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
RENE	Then where's the chip.

RENE	What?
JOE	He plays it all the time.

RENE	Now what?
JOE	We figure out if it's in here.
RENE	How?
JOE	Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.

RENE	That must be him. Water taxi.
JOE	Get us one.
RENE	Too late, they won't come back out till morning.

RENE	Where what?
JOE	Where would you go to sell a chip?

JOE	If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
RENE	Hong Kong.
JOE	What?
RENE	Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.

JOE	Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
RENE	I asked him.
JOE	Oh.

JOE	Why'd you ask him.
RENE	He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
JOE	Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here.

RENE	What?
JOE	I said just relax. I'm in full control.

RENE	Chiang Cho?
JOE	...across THE BORDER. Come on!
RENE	That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
JOE	You've  been there?
RENE	I know the territory.
JOE	You coming along?

JOE	So do I.
RENE	This going to work?
JOE	Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
RENE	He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.

JOE	Why not?
RENE	Can you?
JOE	Sure I can, can't I?

RENE	What happened?
JOE	I can't fly it.
RENE	What'd...you forget?

JOE	Are you alright?
RENE	Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
JOE	Looks like they can. What did they do?
RENE	They asked about you.
JOE	What did you tell them?
RENE	That I really don't know.
JOE	Now what?
RENE	They'll listen to what we say in here.

RENE	What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
JOE	Why?

JOE	What a mess.
RENE	You can say that again. What do we do?
JOE	Nothing we can do.

RENE	What?
JOE	They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
RENE	Can't you do something?

JOE	I'm sorry I got you into this.
RENE	It was my choice.

RENE	Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
JOE	Why did you, then?
RENE	For you.

RENE	I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
JOE	I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.

RENE	How?
JOE	What?

JOE	Now what?
RENE	I've never met anyone like you.

JOE	Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
RENE	I love you too.

JOE	Don't worry.
RENE	Why not, what are you going to do?
JOE	Escape.

RENE	Just like that?
JOE	I'll come back for you.
RENE	Aren't you a little optimistic?

JOE	You son of a bitch! You conned me!
RENE	You're gonna laugh.

RENE	Kiss her you fool.
JOE	Her?

JOE	Who are you? Who do you work for?
RENE	Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
JOE	I knew it. I told him.
RENE	Now what?
JOE	We just don't stop.

JOE	He can't help us.
RENE	Do something!
JOE	Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
RENE	You are, I've seen you.
JOE	It wasn't me. It was him.
RENE	It was you.
JOE	He told me what to do.
RENE	But you did it. It was you.

JOE	It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
RENE	If he was able, what would he say.

JOE	Come on.
RENE	That's twenty feet high.
JOE	Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.

JOE	Riuji?
RENE	I told you, I work for him.

RENE	What is it?
JOE	We're not moving fast enough for him.

RENE	He wants to apologise.
RENE	He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
JOE	Yeah...I have to get away.
RENE	I know a nice island.

RYUJI	Must be a fulfilling occupation.
JOE	It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.

RYUJI	What could you find in this place?
JOE	...Piece of mind.

RYUJI	Excuse me?
JOE	Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?

RYUJI	I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
JOE	Why are you on to him?
RYUJI	We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
JOE	Why'd you invite me here?
RYUJI	Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
JOE	What about the others.
RYUJI	I don't know.

JOE	Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
RECEPTIONIST.	I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
JOE	I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
RECEPTIONIST.	...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?

RECEPTIONIST.	Is there anything else?
JOE	A drink...
RECEPTIONIST.	Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
JOE	Thanks.

TECH 3	Wait.
LEADER	Why?
TECH 3	You can't take that.
LEADER	Why not?
TECH 3	The experiment. The danger...

LEADER	It's alright.
TECH 3	It is?
LEADER	It will be fine. You have another.
TECH 3	Just one. The back up.
LEADER	Could I have it, please.
TECH 3	I can't get it out. It would take hours.
LEADER	That's alright. Just tear it apart.
TECH 3	Tear it apart?
LEADER	Yes.
TECH 3	Ahhh...Okay?!!!

TECH 3	Mom...what are you doing here?
LEADER	Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.

TECH 2	Right there.
LEADER	Thank you.

LEADER	This the only spare?
TECH 2	Yes.
LEADER	The other working.
TECH 2	Perfectly.

TECH 2	Ow?...
LEADER	It'l be alright.
TECH 2	It will.
LEADER	It doesn't hurt.
TECH 2	No?

TECH 3	Screw the PEM...What about Al...
TECH 2	Poor bastard.

TECH 2	What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
TECH 3	What does he know?
TECH 2	Too much.

TECH 3	Look, nobody knows we did it.
TECH 2	Whoever took it does.

TECH 3	It'l take months.
TECH 2	So we better get started.
TECH 3	What about Al...

MILES	Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
BONNIE	Well, I wouldn't say --
MILES	Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
BONNIE	He --
MILES	Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
BONNIE	They hate each other --
MILES	So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?

MARYLIN	Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
DOYLE	I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?

DOYLE	Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
MARYLIN	Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.

MARYLIN	Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
DOYLE	Here. Got pictures.

MARYLIN	Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
DOYLE	...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
MARYLIN	-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.

DOYLE	Baby. You are so HOT!
MARYLIN	Howard!

MARYLIN	As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
DOYLE	You did good, Massey!
MARYLIN	Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
DOYLE	And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
MARYLIN	They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
DOYLE	She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.

DOYLE	Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
MARYLIN	We'd better go before we get thrown out.

MILES	Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
DOYLE	After you, Doll.

MILES	And how is Mrs. Reiser?
DOYLE	Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
MILES	So she's uh, flourishing?
DOYLE	She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.

MILES	Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
DOYLE	Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.

MILES	I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
DOYLE	Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...

MILES	No!
DOYLE	I had no idea until after, but --

MILES	What a touching story.
DOYLE	You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.

DOYLE	Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
MILES	I just want to make sure that you both --

MILES	-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
DOYLE	Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
MILES	And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
DOYLE	A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
MILES	-- and we are sure...

MILES	Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
DOYLE	What part?
MILES	I'd just like to have a word with her.
DOYLE	Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.

MILES	I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
GANGSTER	Who's the pigeon?
MILES	Excuse me?
GANGSTER	Who do you want me to kill?
MILES	Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
GANGSTER	Is that... one person?
MILES	Here's her picture...

GANGSTER	You're in a rush.
MILES	Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.

MARYLIN	Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
JOE	Mr. Dumbarton.

MARYLIN	Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
JOE	No...

JOE	That's his lawyer.
MARYLIN	Triple!
JOE	Who's the pigeon?

JOE	You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
MARYLIN	I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?

JOE	Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
MARYLIN	Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.

MARYLIN	Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
JOE	Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.

RUTH	Objection, your honor!
JUDGE	Grounds?
RUTH	Uh... poetry recitation.

JUDGE	Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
RUTH	We rest, Your Honor.
JUDGE	Mr. Massey?

RUTH	Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
JUDGE	Sustained.

MILES	She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
KENNETH	So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
MILES	Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
KENNETH	Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
MILES	I don't need it.
KENNETH	You want Botox?
MILES	What the hell is Botox?
KENNETH	It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
MILES	Why in God's name would I want...?
KENNETH	No frown lines.  New watch?
MILES	It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
KENNETH	Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
MILES	It was a gift from a client.
KENNETH	Set one side for Bel Air.
MILES	Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
KENNETH	We did not.
MILES	You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
KENNETH	I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
MILES	Denial is not a river in Egypt.

KENNETH	You're in check.
MILES	I should be in therapy.

MILES	Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
KENNETH	Got any symptoms?
MILES	Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
KENNETH	Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
MILES	What?
KENNETH	The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
MILES	She can't really love that idiot, can she?
KENNETH	What?
MILES	Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
KENNETH	Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
MILES	He's the wrong man.
KENNETH	Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.

KENNETH	I'm happy for you, pal.
MILES	Thanks, buddy.
KENNETH	Is she Asian?
MILES	Asian? No.
KENNETH	Well... I'm still...

KENNETH	I have it.
MILES	You have the pre-nup?
KENNETH	No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
MILES	No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
KENNETH	Oh. I thought maybe --  Gee!

MILES	They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
KENNETH	It's your move, Miles.
MILES	I already made my move, Kenneth.

MILES	My God.
KENNETH	What?
MILES	That was Marvin Untermeyer.
KENNETH	Yes?
MILES	He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
KENNETH	What do you mean, was.
MILES	Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.

KENNETH	I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
MILES	Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
KENNETH	Yes.

MILES	She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
KENNETH	So, that's good, right?

KENNETH	Who was that?
MILES	That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
KENNETH	Huh?

MILES	Marylin! What have I done?
KENNETH	I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.

LAWYER	Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
WITNESS	Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
LAWYER	Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
WITNESS	I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
LAWYER	What is your husband's profession?
WITNESS	He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.

RAMONA	So who'd you hire?
MARYLIN	Ruth Rabino.

RAMONA	You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
MARYLIN	No.
RAMONA	You like kids.
MARYLIN	I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.

MARYLIN	It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
RAMONA	Why do you think she did it?
MARYLIN	Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
RAMONA	Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?

RAMONA	I begged you to have a baby!
MARYLIN	In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.

RAMONA	You're vulnerable.
MARYLIN	It's about time.

RAMONA	You said 'yes' didn't you?
MARYLIN	I said yes.

RAMONA	Is Tong older than Ming?
MARYLIN	I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?

MARYLIN	Well. He said to "make the house mine."
RAMONA	Oh boy. If he only knew.
MARYLIN	Yeah. I guess. You know --

RAMONA	It sounded like a bell.
MARYLIN	I'll be right back.

MILES	-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
MARYLIN	And you must be Mr. Massey.

MILES	How nice.
MARYLIN	Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?

MARYLIN	These are yours.
MILES	Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.

MARYLIN	I assume this is on Rex?
MILES	Isn't everything?

MILES	Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
MARYLIN	Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery.

MILES	Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
MARYLIN	Did you see the tape?
MILES	Not yet.
MARYLIN	See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.

MARYLIN	Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
MILES	What does your lawyer think?
MARYLIN	Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
MILES	But you don't agree?
MARYLIN	How do you know?
MILES	Why would you be here?
MARYLIN	I told you. I was hungry.

MILES	I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
MARYLIN	I know you do.

MILES	Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?
MARYLIN	You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
MILES	Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
MARYLIN	Have you ever been married, Miles?
MILES	No.
MARYLIN	You don't believe in it.
MILES	As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
MARYLIN	You just haven't met the right person.
MILES	No. I haven't. Have you?

MARYLIN	All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
MILES	He wants a reconciliation.
MARYLIN	See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
MILES	Gotcha.
MARYLIN	What is it you're after, Miles?
MILES	Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
MARYLIN	Well, don't look at mine!

MARYLIN	Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
MILES	And you've always loved him?

MILES	And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
MARYLIN	Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?

MARYLIN	He'll regret this.
MILES	Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?

MILES	Oh, for the love of...
MARYLIN	That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
MILES	That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.

MILES	-- we are both sure that's what we want?
MARYLIN	Absolutely.

MARYLIN	Getting married.
MILES	To him? He's a sick freak.
MARYLIN	He's passionate.
MILES	Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
MARYLIN	All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
MILES	Marylin! Listen to me.
MARYLIN	No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
MILES	But why him?
MARYLIN	We told you. We realized we've always been in love.

MILES	The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
MARYLIN	So I hear. Is that all?
MILES	No, that's not all.

MILES	I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
MARYLIN	Howard is a beautiful person.
MILES	Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
MARYLIN	Miles. Miles. Miles.
MILES	I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
MARYLIN	It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
MILES	Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
MARYLIN	Have you tried the duck?
MILES	I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.

MARYLIN	It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
MILES	Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.

MILES	To victory.
MARYLIN	I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
MILES	More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
MARYLIN	Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
MILES	No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
MARYLIN	You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.

MILES	Hello?
MARYLIN	Miles?
MILES	Yes? Marylin?
MARYLIN	You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
MILES	Marylin? When did I say...?
MARYLIN	I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!

MARYLIN	Screw you, asswipe!
MILES	Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
MARYLIN	A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
MILES	You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
MARYLIN	I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
MILES	I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
MARYLIN	Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
MILES	No. Don't stop.
MARYLIN	Okay Miles.

MARYLIN	You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
MILES	Thank you.
MARYLIN	You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
MILES	Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
MARYLIN	From a -- girlfriend.
MILES	No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
MARYLIN	No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
MILES	Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.

MARYLIN	Is that you?
MILES	Me. Yes.
MARYLIN	Oh. And that is -- mom?
MILES	Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
MARYLIN	You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.

MILES	Hmmm...
MARYLIN	And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
MILES	She never particularly cared for me.
MARYLIN	She didn't love you?
MILES	No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
MARYLIN	She held that against you?
MILES	Apparently she was very disappointed.
MARYLIN	Boy. Boy, oh boy.

MARYLIN	And here I thought my mother was...
MILES	Your mother was.
MARYLIN	Oh right. You met Patricia.

MARYLIN	We're damaged goods.
MILES	No, we're not!
MARYLIN	We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
MILES	That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
MARYLIN	I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
MILES	No.
MARYLIN	Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.

MARYLIN	Friends?
MILES	Don't go. Stay with me for a while.

MILES	I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
MARYLIN	I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
MILES	And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
MARYLIN	What is it Miles?
MILES	I want... I want to...

MILES	I want to be your -- your wife.
MARYLIN	Huh?
MILES	No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
MARYLIN	Did you just propose to me?
MILES	Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
MARYLIN	Yes.
MILES	Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
MARYLIN	Yes, Miles. I accept.
MILES	You do?
MARYLIN	Do you want me to sleep on it?
MILES	No.
MARYLIN	Do you want to sleep on it?
MILES	No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
MARYLIN	Yes. Again.

MILES	I don't have a ring!
MARYLIN	I know.
MILES	I have a watch.

MARYLIN	Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
MILES	Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.

MILES	No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
MARYLIN	Oh Miles!
MILES	What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.

MILES	But?
MARYLIN	I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.

MARYLIN	I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
MILES	No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."

MARYLIN	Honey, I could sit...
MILES	In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
MARYLIN	Hardly. You have six bedrooms
MILES	I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.

MILES	Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
MARYLIN	Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
MILES	Good.  Are those foods?
MARYLIN	Fabric and fringe.
MILES	Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
MARYLIN	Miles.
MILES	I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --

MARYLIN	Hi.
MILES	Hello Marylin.
MARYLIN	I have a surprise for you.
MILES	I bet.

MARYLIN	You don't like me?
MILES	I love you. I want to have your baby.
MARYLIN	What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?

MARYLIN	Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
MILES	Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
MARYLIN	Miles? You're scaring me.
MILES	I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.

MILES	Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
MARYLIN	May I come in?
MILES	I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
MARYLIN	I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
MILES	I don't believe you have "things."
MARYLIN	On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.

MARYLIN	Comfy!
MILES	What do you want?
MARYLIN	I want to nail you ass.
MILES	Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
MARYLIN	I'm reporting you to the IRS.
MILES	The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.

MILES	I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
MARYLIN	I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --

MARYLIN	STUFF.  Got a light?
MILES	What kind of "stuff?"

MARYLIN	Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
MILES	Those are gifts.
MARYLIN	Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
MILES	You can't prove anything.
MARYLIN	I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
MILES	You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
MARYLIN	I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
MILES	Meaning my house.
MARYLIN	I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
MILES	Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
MARYLIN	Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
MILES	That's blackmail.
MARYLIN	That's marriage.

MARYLIN	Hello?
MILES	Marylin?
MARYLIN	Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
MILES	You have to leave the house immediately!
MARYLIN	I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
MILES	No buts. Now. Out.
MARYLIN	Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
MILES	Please! Leave the house.
MARYLIN	I fell in love Miles.
MILES	So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
MARYLIN	You do? You do love me?

MARYLIN	It's a no go, Joe.
MILES	Marylin!
MARYLIN	It's okay Joe.

MILES	Wait! He works for YOU?
MARYLIN	Now. But first, he worked for you.
MILES	You were going to have this thug...?
MARYLIN	Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.

MILES	Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
MARYLIN	That's true.

MILES	Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
MARYLIN	I'm not leaving you. I took self defense

MILES	Hello Marylin.
MARYLIN	Hello Miles.
MILES	Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
MARYLIN	It's not something I wanted either.
MILES	But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
MARYLIN	Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...

MILES	You wounded me first, Marylin.
MARYLIN	Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
MILES	You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
MARYLIN	Forgery? Fraud?
MILES	Income tax evasion?
MARYLIN	Murder?
MILES	Murder!
MARYLIN	I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...

MILES	Pre-Castro.
MARYLIN	Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"

MARYLIN	Sweet.
MILES	I thought so.

MARYLIN	Rex. Get away from the door.
REX	Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
MARYLIN	We are. And it's winding down.
REX	But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
MARYLIN	Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
REX	Marylin?
MARYLIN	Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
REX	Dogs?

MARYLIN	Hello, Rex.
REX	Marylin.
MARYLIN	Are you alright? You lost weight.
REX	My whole metabolism is -- off.

MARYLIN	Do you need a Tagamet?
REX	You have some?

MARYLIN	Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
REX	Sometimes I forget.

MARYLIN	I'm sorry. Where were we?
RUTH	We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.

MARYLIN	I was devastated. Of course.
RUTH	Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.

RUTH	Who's that?
MARYLIN	Jesus.

RUTH	Is this a lover?
MARYLIN	Please!

MARYLIN	Forgery and Fraud?
RUTH	You used his credit card.
MARYLIN	He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
RUTH	Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
MARYLIN	Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
RUTH	Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
MARYLIN	He never even asked. He just assumed --
RUTH	He was right, wasn't he?
MARYLIN	So. Now what?
RUTH	Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.

SARAH	You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
MARYLIN	I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
SARAH	Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.

SARAH	She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
MARYLIN	She did a Harriman.
SARAH	Wow.
MARYLIN	In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.

MARYLIN	Miles Massey.
SARAH	Of Massey Myerson?
MARYLIN	Do you know him?
SARAH	By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.

MARYLIN	Who's she?
SARAH	Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.

MARYLIN	Maybe.
SARAH	We do have a man for you.

MARYLIN	Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
SARAH	I wish I had your discipline.

MARYLIN	I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
SARAH	Well what does he want?
MARYLIN	I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
SARAH	He has a reputation for being tough.

MARYLIN	Lilly's up.
SARAH	Oh, God!

MARYLIN	Every week --
SARAH	I'm dying.

MARYLIN	Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
SARAH	So where are you now?
MARYLIN	Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
SARAH	Shit.
MARYLIN	Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.

SARAH	That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
MARYLIN	They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.

MARYLIN	Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
SARAH	So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
MARYLIN	Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?

SARAH	You're not...
MARYLIN	No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.

MARYLIN	Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
SARAH	Hello Miles.

SARAH	But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
MARYLIN	I want to be exposed.

MARYLIN	Is this Ming?
SARAH	It's not Ming. It's Tong.

MARYLIN	I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
SARAH	What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
MARYLIN	Right.

SARAH	What?
MARYLIN	He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
SARAH	But you're going through with it?
MARYLIN	Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
SARAH	So what?
MARYLIN	Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
SARAH	Well, that's about to change big time.
MARYLIN	He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
SARAH	Soon, you'll have your own rage!
MARYLIN	I guess.

MILES	-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
WOMAN	He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.

WOMAN	Wait. I know you.
MILES	Yes?
WOMAN	You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
MILES	Excuse me?
WOMAN	You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.

MILES	Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
WOMAN	He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.

MILES	Herb wants to see me?
VOICE	When you have a moment.

VOICE	Mr. Massey --
MILES	Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
VOICE	I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
MILES	Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
VOICE	She's here now.

MILES	So, Ruth. How's Sam?
RUTH	Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
MILES	A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.

MILES	What?!
RUTH	Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.

RUTH	So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
MILES	At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
RUTH	My client has ruled that out.
MILES	My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
RUTH	That's delusional.
MILES	My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
RUTH	My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
MILES	My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
RUTH	Ha Ha.
MILES	Heh heh.

MILES	-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
RUTH	My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
MILES	Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
RUTH	Oh brother. Here we go.
MILES	Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
RUTH	Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.

MILES	Are you familiar with Kirshner?
RUTH	Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.

RUTH	...arty farty!
MILES	Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?

MILES	He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
RUTH	Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
MILES	He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
RUTH	I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
MILES	Did Marylin end up with money?
RUTH	She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
MILES	I don't have a pre-nup

RUTH	...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
MILES	Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
RUTH	And it's good!
MILES	I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
RUTH	Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
MILES	...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
RUTH	That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --

MILES	Where does that leave us?
RUTH	We've outlined a settlement...

MILES	Mr. Rexroth.
REX	Rex, please.
MILES	Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
REX	Thank you.
MILES	Now Rex.

REX	...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
MILES	That's her job. You have to respect that.
REX	When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
MILES	Mm.
REX	But then... But then...

MILES	Time marches on. Ardor cools.
REX	No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
MILES	Ah.
REX	You know what I mean when I say "it."
MILES	Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
REX	Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
MILES	Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
REX	I don't know. I can assume...
MILES	Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
REX	I'm not sure.
MILES	And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
REX	Video.
MILES	Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?

MILES	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
REX	That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
MILES	Nothing?
REX	I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
MILES	So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
REX	Well -- is that possible?

REX	What's Kirshner?
MILES	Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?

MILES	I think that went as well as could be expected.
REX	She always looked out for me.
MILES	And she had private investigators assisting her.
REX	She brought my digestive enzymes.
MILES	In anticipation of making you sick.
REX	Maybe I should reconsider my...

WRIGLEY	Wait... He wants to give her...?
MILES	Nothing.
WRIGLEY	And she has...?
MILES	Video.
WRIGLEY	What the fuck...?

MILES	Wrigley!
WRIGLEY	Sorry.
MILES	Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
WRIGLEY	I am very sorry.
MILES	Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
WRIGLEY	No. You're not.
MILES	I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.

MILES	What the hell is wrong with you?
WRIGLEY	I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
MILES	Is she going through with it?

WRIGLEY	What do you think?
MILES	What are they?
WRIGLEY	Berry spoons.
MILES	Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
WRIGLEY	Miles -- why so angry?

WRIGLEY	I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
MILES	HA!
WRIGLEY	...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
MILES	Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
WRIGLEY	She could buy and sell you ten times over.
MILES	She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.

MILES	Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
WRIGLEY	What...?
MILES	She owes me a meal.
WRIGLEY	I'd stay away from her, Miles.
MILES	I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?

MILES	Wrigley?
WRIGLEY	Miles.
MILES	Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
WRIGLEY	The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
MILES	Do you have it?

WRIGLEY	I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
MILES	We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
WRIGLEY	The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.

MILES	Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
WRIGLEY	-- the coin?

WRIGLEY	Extinguish?
MILES	Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?

MILES	Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
PATRICIA	We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.

MILES	And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
PATRICIA	Mother?

PATRICIA	Hi, Sweetie.
MILES	Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.

PATRICIA	No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
MILES	You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
PATRICIA	No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.

MILES	Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
PATRICIA	Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.

PATRICIA	Let me tell you something about Patty.
MILES	Who's "Patty."
PATRICIA	Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
MILES	I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
PATRICIA	When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."

MILES	Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
PATRICIA	Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty

RAMONA	I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
SARAH	Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
RAMONA	Three is not Farrow.
SARAH	Who's Rex's guy?

RAMONA	George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
SARAH	Muriel Rumsey.

SARAH	It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
RAMONA	Maybe next time.

RAMONA	Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
SARAH	She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
RAMONA	And only two are hers.

RAMONA	That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
SARAH	Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?

ADVISOR	Harvard Law School?
ELLE	That's right.
ADVISOR	But it's a top three school --
ELLE	I have a 4.0.
ADVISOR	Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
ELLE	I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.

ADVISOR	Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
ELLE	I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.

DONOVAN	What alibi?
BROOKE	I can't tell you.
DONOVAN	You understand you're on trial for murder?
BROOKE	I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
DONOVAN	Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.

BROOKE	Why would I kill my husband?
DONOVAN	Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
BROOKE	I loved him!
DONOVAN	He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.

DONOVAN	Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
BROOKE	I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.

DONOVAN	Were you with another man?
BROOKE	Go to hell.
DONOVAN	I'll take that as a no.
BROOKE	Are we done for today?
DONOVAN	I believe we are.

DONOVAN	What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
BROOKE	Get up.
DONOVAN	What?
BROOKE	You're fired. I have new representation.
DONOVAN	Who?

BROOKE	Is he always such an ass?
EMMETT	He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
BROOKE	But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
EMMETT	He's an ass that's gonna try.
BROOKE	He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
EMMETT	That's not what's important.
BROOKE	To me it is. He doesn't trust me. Why should I trust him?

ELLE	I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
BROOKE	You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
ELLE	Sort of.

ELLE	Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
BROOKE	I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
ELLE	He means well. He's really brilliant and all.

BROOKE	Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
ELLE	Who could better understand than me?

BROOKE	It's so shameful...
ELLE	Whatever it is -- it could save you.
BROOKE	That's just it -- it would ruin me!
ELLE	How?

BROOKE	I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
ELLE	I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!

ELLE	No!
BROOKE	I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!

BROOKE	I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
ELLE	I believe you! Don't worry.

BROOKE	What's going on?
ELLE	Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
BROOKE	He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --

CHUTNEY	I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
DONOVAN	Did she have a weapon in her hand?
CHUTNEY	No.
DONOVAN	Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
CHUTNEY	Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
DONOVAN	Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
CHUTNEY	His dead body with a bullet in it.

ELLE	Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
CHUTNEY	Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
ELLE	And when you came downstairs, what happened?
CHUTNEY	I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
ELLE	But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
CHUTNEY	No, she'd stashed it by then.

ELLE	Did you hear a shot fired?
CHUTNEY	No. I was in the shower.
ELLE	So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
CHUTNEY	I guess.

ELLE	But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower.
CHUTNEY	Yes. I was washing my hair.

ELLE	Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
CHUTNEY	I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
ELLE	Where you got in the shower.
CHUTNEY	Yes.

ELLE	Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
CHUTNEY	Yes.

ELLE	How many, would you say?
CHUTNEY	Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
ELLE	You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her --  She didn't have your bone structure.

ELLE	Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
CHUTNEY	Because they got wet.
ELLE	That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?

ELLE	And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
CHUTNEY	She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
ELLE	You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?

ELLE	Dewey Newcomb?
DEWEY	Who's askin'?
ELLE	I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.

DEWEY	Come again?
ELLE	Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
DEWEY	Huh?
ELLE	Tell him, Paulette.

ELLE	All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
DONOVAN	That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.

DONOVAN	Did you get it?
ELLE	Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.

DONOVAN	Why the hell not?
ELLE	I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!

DONOVAN	What are you talking about?
ELLE	He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.

DONOVAN	Good work today, Ms. Woods.
ELLE	Thank you!

DONOVAN	Sit down.
ELLE	Is everything okay?
DONOVAN	You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
ELLE	Thank you.
DONOVAN	About the alibi --

ELLE	I'm sorry, but --
DONOVAN	I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.

DONOVAN	I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
ELLE	Not really. I know how competitive it all is --

ELLE	You're hitting on me?
DONOVAN	You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
ELLE	So everything you just said --
DONOVAN	I'm a man who knows what I want.

DONOVAN	You're not going up there.
ELLE	Yes, I am.

DONOVAN	I do. I'm not allowing it.
ELLE	But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?

DONOVAN	What did you see when you entered the house?
ENRIQUE	I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
DONOVAN	Was she carrying a weapon?
ENRIQUE	No, she was crying her eyes out.

DONOVAN	So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
ENRIQUE	Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.

DONOVAN	Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
ENRIQUE	Just the love in my heart.

ELLE	What's going on?
DORKY DAVID	Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
ELLE	He chose them already?

ELLE	Why didn't you call me?
DORKY DAVID	What?
ELLE	We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
DORKY DAVID	-- uh --

DORKY DAVID	I'm sorry?
ELLE	For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
DORKY DAVID	Uh -- both?
ELLE	Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.

DORKY DAVID	Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
ELLE	See?

PROFESSOR STROMWELL	Yes?
DORKY DAVID	Aristotle.

DORKY DAVID	Yes?
PROFESSOR STROMWELL	Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
DORKY DAVID	I think so...
PROFESSOR STROMWELL	How about --

PROFESSOR STROMWELL	-- his life?
DORKY DAVID	I don't know.
PROFESSOR STROMWELL	Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.

ELLE	You can't even imagine.
PAULETTE	Spill.

PAULETTE	After you went to all that trouble?
ELLE	Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
PAULETTE	You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
ELLE	What'd you do?
PAULETTE	Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.

PAULETTE	I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
ELLE	No!
PAULETTE	What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
ELLE	That's terrible!
PAULETTE	So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
ELLE	She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
PAULETTE	Is she as pretty as you?

PAULETTE	Is she?
ELLE	She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.

PAULETTE	Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
ELLE	Definitely! I love him!

PAULETTE	You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
ELLE	I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.

ELLE	You ready?
PAULETTE	No.
ELLE	Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.

PAULETTE	God, that felt great!
ELLE	Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
PAULETTE	Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...

ELLE	I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
PAULETTE	That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...

ELLE	So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
PAULETTE	No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
ELLE	Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
PAULETTE	What's the point?  Look at me.
ELLE	I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.

PAULETTE	Good one.
ELLE	Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.

PAULETTE	And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
ELLE	I'm so happy for you!
PAULETTE	How'd it go at the trial?
ELLE	Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
PAULETTE	Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.

PAULETTE	You can't go home!
ELLE	What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.

ELLE	I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
GUARD	Licensed attorney or family member?
ELLE	Uh -- family.
GUARD	Relation?
ELLE	I'm her sister.
GUARD	Name?
ELLE	Delta. Gamma.

SARAH	Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
ELLE	You know her?

SARAH	Our group is full.
ELLE	Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?

SARAH	The idiot speaks.
ELLE	Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?

SARAH	I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
ELLE	Too bad you and I are the only ones.
SARAH	I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.

ELLE	It's not my alibi to tell --
SARAH	I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
ELLE	Really? Thanks.

SARAH	Warner can't even do his own laundry.
ELLE	I know. He has it sent out.
SARAH	Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
ELLE	You're kidding!

SARAH	Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
ELLE	Really?
SARAH	He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.

SARAH	You almost had me fooled.
ELLE	What?
SARAH	Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.

SARAH	I'm a bitch.
ELLE	Yes, you are.
SARAH	And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
ELLE	Yes, he is.

ELLE	You're pawning The Rock?!
SARAH	Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.

MARGOT	Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
ELLE	You guys are so sweet!

MARGOT	Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
ELLE	You think?

ELLE	Too demure?
MARGOT	I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
ELLE	Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...

ELLE	What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
MARGOT	Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.

ELLE	I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
MARGOT	Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!

MARGOT	We still love you. Sisters forever!
ELLE	Thank you. I love you, too.

MARGOT	Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
ELLE	So?

ELLE	Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
MARGOT	But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
ELLE	I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!

MARGOT	Here. You're gonna need this.
ELLE	Your scrunchie?
MARGOT	My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.

MARGOT	Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
ELLE	Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --

MARGOT	It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
ELLE	Power yoga?
MARGOT	Picking out my wedding dress!
ELLE	What?!
MARGOT	Josh proposed!
ELLE	No way --

MARGOT	Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
ELLE	I will...

MARGOT	Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
ELLE	Margot!

MARGOT	Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
ELLE	I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.

MARGOT	Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
ELLE	Not yet.

ELLE	Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
EMMETT	The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
ELLE	And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?

EMMETT	You have Stromwell.
ELLE	Did she do that to you, too?
EMMETT	No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
ELLE	Neat.
EMMETT	Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?

ELLE	Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
EMMETT	Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.

EMMETT	And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
ELLE	Wow. I'm glad I met you.

EMMETT	Good luck.
ELLE	Thanks again for your help!

ELLE	Don't ask.
EMMETT	I wasn't gonna --

EMMETT	Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
ELLE	My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.

ELLE	Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
EMMETT	Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
ELLE	Aside from that.
EMMETT	She's completely untrustworthy.
ELLE	Why?
EMMETT	She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
ELLE	A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
EMMETT	And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
ELLE	But maybe it's not what you think.
EMMETT	But maybe it is --

ELLE	You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
EMMETT	How do you figure?
ELLE	Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.

EMMETT	I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
ELLE	Maybe not to your face...

EMMETT	Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
ELLE	No, she can't move for an hour.

ELLE	Mrs. Windham Vandermark?
EMMETT	We're here from Austen, Platt, Jaret & Donovan --

ELLE	She's not!
EMMETT	Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?

EMMETT	How can you still believe she's innocent?
ELLE	You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
EMMETT	And you know this for a fact?
ELLE	Did you see the icky black color of her hair?
EMMETT	So?
ELLE	I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.

EMMETT	The what?
ELLE	Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
EMMETT	You're serious?

EMMETT	Okay, how would it work?
ELLE	It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
EMMETT	I can't.
ELLE	That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
EMMETT	Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
ELLE	If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.

EMMETT	In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
ELLE	Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
EMMETT	That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.

EMMETT	What the hell is that for?
ELLE	The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
EMMETT	I don't --  Do that stuff.
ELLE	Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
EMMETT	Projecting joy is not my job.
ELLE	Fine. Sorry I brought it up.

EMMETT	You really think I'm attractive?
ELLE	For a butt-head? Yes.

ELLE	He's gay! Enrique is gay!
EMMETT	What?!

EMMETT	Back up. How do you know he's gay?
ELLE	Gay men know designers. Straight men don't.

EMMETT	Hey --
ELLE	I'm quitting.

EMMETT	Whoa -- Why?
ELLE	Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
EMMETT	What're you talking about? You earned it --

EMMETT	So now you're -- ?
ELLE	Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
EMMETT	What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.

ELLE	Oh, my God!
EMMETT	Oh, my God!!

EMMETT	Up for a celebration dinner?
ELLE	Are you asking me on a date?
EMMETT	As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
ELLE	Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
EMMETT	So Friday at eight?

EMMETT	Someone missed you.
ELLE	Is he the only one?
EMMETT	What do you think?

ELLE	But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
SERENA	Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".

ELLE	No -- it's just -- not me.
SERENA	I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
ELLE	Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
SERENA	What happened?

SERENA	Oh, he is so over on this campus.
ELLE	I just don't understand what went wrong --

SERENA	How could this happen?
ELLE	I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
SERENA	Are you sure?

ELLE	Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
SERENA	What, like on va-kay?

ELLE	Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
SERENA	Absolutely!

ELLE	Almost.
SERENA	Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
ELLE	I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
SERENA	Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
ELLE	What?
SERENA	I got bangs!
ELLE	Really --

ELLE	What're you doing here?!
SERENA	We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.

ELLE	You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
SERENA	Where's Warner?

SERENA	I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
ELLE	I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!

ELLE	Neither.
PROFESSOR DONOVAN	Why not?
ELLE	I'd rather have a client who's innocent.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN	Yes? Ms. Woods?
ELLE	I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.

ELLE	I did?
PROFESSOR DONOVAN	You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
ELLE	I don't know --
PROFESSOR DONOVAN	You should. Do you have a resume?
ELLE	I do.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN	It's pink.
ELLE	And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!

PROFESSOR DONOVAN	Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
ELLE	She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!

PROFESSOR DONOVAN	Amazing how?
ELLE	She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
PROFESSOR DONOVAN	Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN	His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
ELLE	Maybe she found him like that.
PROFESSOR DONOVAN	That's the story she'll be telling the jury. We just have to prove it.

PROFESSOR DONOVAN	You don't really believe she's innocent?
ELLE	Of course, I do!

FUZZY 2L	Class schedule, map, book list.
ELLE	Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
FUZZY 2L	Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.

ELLE	Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
FUZZY 2L	Your what?
ELLE	You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
FUZZY 2L	There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
ELLE	I guess it'll have to...

WARNER	You're beautiful.
ELLE	So are you!

ELLE	I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
WARNER	I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
ELLE	Of course.
WARNER	My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
ELLE	And I fully support that.
WARNER	But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
ELLE	I completely agree.
WARNER	That's why I think it's time for us to --

WARNER	I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
ELLE	You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
WARNER	Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
ELLE	You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
WARNER	That's not entirely --
ELLE	Then what? My boobs are too big?
WARNER	Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --

WARNER	C'mon. Let me take you home.
ELLE	No.
WARNER	Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.

WARNER	Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
ELLE	How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
WARNER	I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
ELLE	So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
WARNER	East coast people are different.
ELLE	Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
WARNER	I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
ELLE	I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?

WARNER	What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
ELLE	No, silly. I go here.
WARNER	You go where?
ELLE	Harvard. Law school.
WARNER	You got into Harvard Law?
ELLE	What, like it's that hard?

ELLE	Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
WARNER	Uh -- sure.

WARNER	So -- uh -- how was your first class?
ELLE	Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?

WARNER	Good. Good.
ELLE	Do anything exciting?

ELLE	I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
WARNER	Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.

WARNER	Wow. You're a walking felony.
ELLE	Thank you. Having fun?
WARNER	Now I am.
ELLE	I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
WARNER	That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
ELLE	Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
WARNER	Elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get the grades to qualify for one of those spots. You're not smart enough.

WARNER	I didn't mean --
ELLE	Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
WARNER	Well, yeah, but --
ELLE	But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
WARNER	I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.

WARNER	You look -- nice.
ELLE	Thank you.

WARNER	If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
ELLE	I gave her my word, Warner.

WARNER	Pink ones.
ELLE	See?

ELLE	Thanks for the backup.
WARNER	How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?

WARNER	It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
ELLE	Really?

ELLE	In court. On opposing sides.
WARNER	Are you serious?
ELLE	Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am.

EMMETT	Did you ever take Mrs. Windham on a date?
ENRIQUE	Yes.
EMMETT	Where?
ENRIQUE	A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
EMMETT	And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
ENRIQUE	Three months.
EMMETT	And what is your boyfriend's name?
ENRIQUE	Chuck.

EMMETT	She's naked.
MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK	I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK	So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
EMMETT	Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK	I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun --

MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK	Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
EMMETT	I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK	But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
EMMETT	Why do you say that?
MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK	Haven't you seen the cabana boy?

EMMETT	Hovering?
MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK	I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.

MARGOT	Elle?
SERENA	Where's the Rock?

SERENA	Is it a Kappa?
MARGOT	It's not a Theta --

MARGOT	Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
SERENA	Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
MARGOT	You're right. Phew!

SERENA	What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
MARGOT	Cunnilingus?

MARGOT	Let's all go! Road trip!
SERENA	Wait -- Cecil has a condo in Tahoe. Let's go there!

MARGOT	Why?!
SERENA	I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?

SERENA	You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
MARGOT	Yeah, luckily.

SERENA	There he is!
MARGOT	Pull up next to him!

KAY	The hell happened?
COWAN	Hesitated, sir.
KAY	I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.

KAY	You shot an eight year old girl.
COWAN	Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
KAY	The hell were you thinking?
COWAN	Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
KAY	Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.

COWAN	Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
KAY	Cowan--
COWAN	Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
KAY	Cowan--
COWAN	of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
KAY	Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?

COWAN	Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
KAY	It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.

COWAN	So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
KAY	It's not even a fucking door.

KAY	...touch that.
COWAN	What the hell...
KAY	Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
COWAN	I guess I lost:
KAY	You got smeared.

KAY	We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
COWAN	And Goodwill Toward Man?
KAY	No. just peace on Earth.
COWAN	I gotta be honest about something.

COWAN	Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
KAY	Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.

KAY	It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
COWAN	And if I say yes?
KAY	Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.

COWAN	... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
ZED	Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
COWAN	They don't?
ZED	They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.

ZED	What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
COWAN	I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.

COWAN	Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
ZED	For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
COWAN	Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
ZED	We're the government, Cowan.

ZED	You think we're nuts.
COWAN	No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
ZED	Mrs. Edelson?

ZED	Only the damn guy won't know it.
COWAN	What happens if I say no?

ZED	From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
COWAN	Yes, sir.

ZED	Everybody, listen up: we've had a tremendous amount of movement lately. Be aware.  Be safe.  Have a good day.  Oh, uh... Cowan?
COWAN	Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.

ZED	Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
COWAN	Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
ZED	Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.

COWAN	So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
ZED	His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
COWAN	It'll make sense later?
ZED	No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.

WALLACE	Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
COWAN	Further... what are you talking about, air?  That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
WALLACE	Actually, it didn't come from me.

COWAN	Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
WALLACE	Well this didn't.
COWAN	Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--

WALLACE	Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
COWAN	Actually, sir--
WALLACE	Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
COWAN	All the time, sir.
WALLACE	You do?
COWAN	Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.

KAY	Which do you have your money on, Dee?
DEE	I'd go with number three.
KAY	Three, huh?  Really? Cause a cup of coffee says we're talking about... number... four?  Huh?  No?

KAY	Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
DEE	Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
KAY	What?  I thought you just--

KAY	Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
DEE	Kay, I'm sorry...
KAY	Don't worry about it.  Four-Eyes'll run a track on him.  We'll get that son of a... whatever the hell he's the son of.

DEE	Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
KAY	Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?

KAY	I wasn't scared...
DEE	Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...

KAY	Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
DEE	Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
KAY	Don't worry about it.

DEE	Helluva night, isn't it?
KAY	Yup.  Sure is.

DEE	'Hell, I may as well do something useful.
KAY	Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
DEE	Home?  You gotta be kidding me.    Black?

KAY	Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
DEE	Kay...

KAY	We'll take it from here.
INS LEADER	What?  Who the hell are you?
KAY	INS, Washington.  Special services.

KAY	Vayanse. You others, go on.
INS LEADER	Sir--
KAY	Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
INS LEADER	Sir, you can't just--
KAY	DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

KAY	This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
INS LEADER	Why?  What are you gonna do?
KAY	Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.

KAY	Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
INS LEADER	What?
KAY	You heard me.  You two, especially.

JAY	Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
KAY	We wear black.
JAY	Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?

KAY	The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
JAY	I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.

JAY	It's a bug.
KAY	Right.
JAY	But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.

JAY	So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
KAY	So what's the problem?
JAY	Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...

JAY	I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
KAY	It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
JAY	I know, but we're on a college campus...
KAY	This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.

JAY	I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
KAY	Keep her out of here while I check it out.
JAY	I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..

JAY	I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
KAY	She didn't even know you. .
JAY	I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
KAY	Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
JAY	Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
KAY	Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
JAY	I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
KAY	If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
JAY	I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
KAY	You don't know the half of it.
JAY	What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
KAY	I taught kindergarten.
JAY	Ha ha.  No, really.
KAY	It was a long time ago.-

JAY	Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
KAY	Why?
JAY	Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
KAY	You don't know me at all.
JAY	Um-- Kay?

JAY	Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
KAY	Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.

JAY	What?
KAY	Something seem unusual to you about that?
JAY	Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
KAY	If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
JAY	I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
KAY	Let's check am out.

JAY	what's this?
KAY	It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.

KAY	Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
JAY	I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
KAY	Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
JAY	A what?

JAY	Now what?
KAY	History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.

KAY	A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
JAY	Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
KAY	Hold it.

KAY	He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
JAY	There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
KAY	There's a god damn good reason.

KAY	Something's wrong here.
JAY	Gee.  You really think?
KAY	Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
JAY	I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
KAY	Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
JAY	And what's this ... ?
KAY	What?

JAY	Looks like a train ticket.
KAY	Where to?

JAY	What's going on, Kay?
KAY	I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
JAY	The radio show?
KAY	No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
JAY	You think that's what's-happening?
KAY	I think that's what's happening...

KAY	Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
JAY	That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?

JAY	Jesus...
KAY	Get back in the car!

JAY	Jesus Christ...
KAY	We're rising.

KAY	Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
JAY	The Pentagon.

KAY	Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs...
JAY	I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.

KAY	Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
JAY	What if he's telling the truth?
KAY	You know something?  I actually never think of that.  I gotta get some coffee.

JAY	Kay--
KAY	Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?

KAY	He's here to help!?
JAY	Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
KAY	How does that help me?
JAY	Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.

KAY	Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
JAY	Kay.  All I'm saying--
KAY	I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
JAY	I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
KAY	Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
JAY	That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.

JAY	What are you doing?
KAY	Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?

JAY	Since how long?
KAY	Since as long as we've been keeping records...

KAY	Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
JAY	For how long?

KAY	We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
JAY	Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?

KAY	It's marble.
JAY	All of it?

JAY	Would you call this a code 100?
KAY	I'd double it and add 20.

KAY	I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
JAY	Do his job.
KAY	Right.  Oh, and here.

JAY	Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
KAY	Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
JAY	in case I need it?
KAY	In case I need it.

KAY	Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
JAY	Kay!?

KAY	You were saying?
JAY	Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?

JAY	After I got the shit beat out of me!
KAY	And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
JAY	You coulda told me what you were doing.
KAY	There wasn't time, sport!

JAY	Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
KAY	Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
JAY	Kay, you're scaring your partner.
KAY	I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
JAY	Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.

JAY	I'm just wondering what's so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
ZED	Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
JAY	Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?

ZED	Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
JAY	You know, there's something we never really thought of...

JAY	Sure.
ZED	Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.

ZED	I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
JAY	Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?

JAY	So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
LAUREL	Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?

LAUREL	Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
JAY	I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.

LAUREL	So... how'd you hear about this?
JAY	Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
LAUREL	Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.

JAY	Right, right-- I like that stuff.
LAUREL	With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
JAY	Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
LAUREL	Do have any idea what I just said?

LAUREL	Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
JAY	Actually, you may have.

LAUREL	It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
JAY	I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
LAUREL	I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
JAY	Why not?
LAUREL	Well, first of all, it's entomologist.

LAUREL	I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
JAY	What is it?
LAUREL	It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
JAY	But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
LAUREL	Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.

JAY	When?
LAUREL	It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
JAY	So... how did they get here?

LAUREL	What do we do?
JAY	What do we do?    Lean into it.
LAUREL	What the hell does that mean?
JAY	Actually... I don't know.

JAY	Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
LAUREL	Out of focus?

JAY	Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
LAUREL	The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
JAY	What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
LAUREL	Are you sure you don't?

LAUREL	What are you doing?
JAY	They respond to fear, right?
LAUREL	Yeah ... ?
JAY	Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.

KAY	What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
JEEBS	No.
KAY	Maybe you need a closer look.

JEEBS	The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
KAY	You figured what?
JEEBS	I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.

KAY	Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
JEEBS	I understand.  I understand, thank you. --How about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?

KAY	And I'm arranging deportation papers.
JEEBS	Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
KAY	And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--

KAY	Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
JEEBS	You're not taking me in!

KAY	Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
YAZ	How could it not?
KAY	Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
YAZ	Come on now.  People are smart.
KAY	No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.

KAY	Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
YAZ	Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.

KAY	Goodwill...
YAZ	Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.

MIKEY	Nowhere.
KAY	Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.

MIKEY	Er. well, nowhere special.
KAY	I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
MIKEY	Yeah, wall, you know, I was just going there... to pick then up.

KAY	Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
MIKEY	I dunno. One?
KAY	Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
MIKEY	It's... coming.
KAY	What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?

KAY	So... now what?  Cattle call again?
KAY	Yeah, I'll talk to you.

KAY	... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
ZED'S VOICE	Nothing.
KAY	Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
ZED'S VOICE	Nope.  Nothing at all.

KAY	I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
ZED'S VOICE	Yeah, Kay?
KAY	Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
ZED'S VOICE	Noon exactly.
KAY	Did he say where?
ZED'S VOICE	Actually, yeah--
KAY	Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
ZED'S VOICE	How'd you know that?  Kay?
KAY	Cause I think we're looking at it.

KAY	Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
LEONARD	They're not my pals--
KAY	They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
LEONARD	What if I don't?
KAY	In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
LEONARD	Will it lower the curve?
KAY	I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
LEONARD	I wanna make a deal.

LEONARD	Found it.
KAY	Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
LEONARD	I promised I wouldn't tell.

LEONARD	I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
KAY	This guy.  Where was he?

KAY	We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
LAUREL	Scientific American?  Really?

KAY	This it?
LAUREL	Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.

LAUREL	I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
KAY	May I have a look?

KAY	We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
LAUREL	Come again?

LAUREL	Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
KAY	But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.

KAY	We need to talk to you about the alien.
LAUREL	The what?

KAY	Which way?
LAUREL	Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.

LAUREL	Really nice wheels, by the way.
KAY	Wait-- listen--

ZED	How's Dee?
KAY	Fine.  Good.

KAY	Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
ZED	So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?

ZED	Kay?  What's your 20?
KAY	Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
ZED	I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
KAY	What the hell is going on?

ZED	He's gone, too.
KAY	What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
ZED	Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.

ZED	Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
KAY	Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
ZED	Hard to tell.  I hope not.
KAY	Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.

ZED	They're gone.
KAY	Dee?  What are you doing here?

KAY	I'm getting a trajectory...
ZED	What do we have?  Are we showing anything?

KAY	And they're buying it?
ZED	They went right to the President.
KAY	They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?

ZED	As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
KAY	Where's he making his big speech?
ZED	They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.

ZED	Well, it wasn't in the jar...
KAY	Did it leave?
ZED	Actually, I don't know...
KAY	Oh shit!

KAY	Yeah?  What's up?
ZED	I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.

ZED	And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
KAY	Don't tell me.  Insects.

ZED	How'd you know?
KAY	Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.

YAZ	Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
PRESIDENT	Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
YAZ	That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.

YAZ	Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
PRESIDENT	If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
YAZ	A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
PRESIDENT	And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
YAZ	That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.

ARTHUR	Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
BOBBY	What are you talking about?
ARTHUR	Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
BOBBY	They were grabbing her fucking ass --
ARTHUR	Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
BOBBY	Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
ARTHUR	Good luck.

BOBBY	Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
AUDREY	You're Bobby, right?
BOBBY	Yeah.
AUDREY	Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.

AUDREY	He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
BOBBY	No thank you.
AUDREY	You sure? I just made it.
BOBBY	No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.

HORRACE	Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
BARTENDER	Snifter are for warm drinks --
HORRACE	Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
BARTENDER	When served warm --
HORRACE	What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
BARTENDER	We have snifters
HORRACE	Then put my Martel's in a snifter.

BELLMAN	...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
RICKY	What's 'incidentals?'
BELLMAN	Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.

BELLMAN	Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
RICKY	Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
BELLMAN	Yes, sir.
RICKY	Is it a good room?
BELLMAN	I can take you down there.
RICKY	Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
BELLMAN	Not on me, sir.
RICKY	Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
BELLMAN	Are you sure?
RICKY	Yeah. Take it.
BELLMAN	Thank you very much, sir.
RICKY	So?
BELLMAN	What, sir?
RICKY	Is it the good room?
BELLMAN	All the suites are about the same.
RICKY	Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
BELLMAN	Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
RICKY	What if I gave you forty?
BELLMAN	It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
RICKY	No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
BELLMAN	Thank you, sir.
RICKY	Where's the place to go tonight?
BELLMAN	As far as...?
RICKY	Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
BELLMAN	Women?
RICKY	Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
BELLMAN	I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
RICKY	Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
BELLMAN	It's on West Broadway.
RICKY	See you later.

RICKY	So, wait, you're from where?
BIANCA	Manhattan.
RICKY	You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
BIANCA	No.

RICKY	I don't get it. What do you do?
BIANCA	We're in Fashion.
RICKY	So you're models?

RICKY	I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
BIANCA	What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
RICKY	Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'

RICKY	Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
BIANCA	Somebody's getting comfortable.

CYNTHIA	Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
BIANCA	Holy shit.
CYNTHIA	I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.

CYNTHIA	Is he cute?
BIANCA	He's okay.
CYNTHIA	Should I fuck him?
BIANCA	I don't know. Do whatever you want.
CYNTHIA	He's great, right. Is he great?
BIANCA	He's alright.
CYNTHIA	I know.
BIANCA	But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.

BIANCA	Oh no. What is it this time.
CYNTHIA	We used to take baths together.
BIANCA	Come on. Let's go.

WENDY	What the fuck was that about?
BOBBY	You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
WENDY	I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
BOBBY	Bullshit.
WENDY	You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
BOBBY	No more.

BOBBY	Nobody's fuckin talking to you.
WENDY	And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
BOBBY	I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
WENDY	Bullshit.
BOBBY	What? You don't think Horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?

CHLOE	Ricky's not wearing one.
BOBBY	Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?

CHLOE	A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
BOBBY	She's, uh, sleeping.
CHLOE	It's daytime.
BOBBY	Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
CHLOE	No.
BOBBY	Show uncle Ricky what you made.

BOBBY	What's wrong, baby?
CHLOE	He's not doing it.

CHLOE	It's a poison arrow tree frog.
BOBBY	Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.

CHLOE	You're not my daddy.
BOBBY	You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
CHLOE	I want spaghettis.

CHLOE	Hello.
BOBBY	Chloe?
CHLOE	Uncle Bobby?
BOBBY	Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
CHLOE	I don't know.
BOBBY	Mommy's not home?
CHLOE	No.
BOBBY	What time is it there?
CHLOE	Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
BOBBY	Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.

BOBBY	I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
CHLOE	I love you. Come home.

BOBBY	Honey?
JESS	Where were you?

BOBBY	So, what kind of gig is this?
JESS	Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
BOBBY	No. What kind of bachelor party?
JESS	The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.

JESS	Oh my god. What happened?
BOBBY	A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
JESS	Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
BOBBY	I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
JESS	They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
BOBBY	Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
JESS	Oh, please.
BOBBY	If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
JESS	Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
BOBBY	Who's watching the baby?
JESS	She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
BOBBY	I'm ready.
JESS	Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
BOBBY	They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.

BOBBY	You talk to Max today?
JESS	I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
BOBBY	Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
JESS	The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
BOBBY	Well, that's not gonna happen.
JESS	Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
BOBBY	I feel weird asking him.
JESS	You shouldn't. He likes you.
BOBBY	I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
JESS	Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
BOBBY	No coke tonight.  Right?
JESS	Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.

BOBBY	Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
JESS	Yeah? You sure?
BOBBY	Go.

BOBBY	No way that cocksucker's driving you.
JESS	Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
BOBBY	Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
JESS	Ho's a good guy --
BOBBY	Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
JESS	Shhh. He'll hear you.
BOBBY	Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
JESS	Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
BOBBY	I want you to quit.
JESS	Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
BOBBY	I'll support you.
JESS	With what?
BOBBY	Max offered to stake me.
JESS	Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.

BOBBY	She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
JESS	Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.

JESS	I never promised you anything.
BOBBY	How could you let her see this?
JESS	Goodbye, Bobby.
BOBBY	Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
JESS	Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
BOBBY	Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.

JESS	Take her.
BOBBY	What'd you say?
JESS	I want you to take her with you.

HORNY GUY	Whu --
BOBBY	There's no touching.
HORNY GUY	But what about them?
BOBBY	I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.

BOBBY	I said no touching.
HORNY GUY	Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
BOBBY	Get your hands off of her.
HORNY GUY	Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
BOBBY	Your dance is over.
HORNY GUY	Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --

HORNY GUY	I -- I -- I... Don't...
BOBBY	I don't get it.

HORRACE	It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
BOBBY	I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
HORRACE	Well, you look it. You win?
BOBBY	Draw.
HORRACE	What's your record at?
BOBBY	5-5-1.
HORRACE	Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
BOBBY	Yeah, sure.
HORRACE	I'm serious. Humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. Might be nice to buy your lady something. All it takes is one fight.

HORRACE	What's up? Jess ready?
BOBBY	You driving her?
HORRACE	Yeah.
BOBBY	She'll be out in a minute.

HORRACE	C'mon girl. Eat up.
BOBBY	Get away from her.
HORRACE	Excuse --

HORRACE	What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
BOBBY	Yeah. Where is he?

BOBBY	He making the drop?
HORRACE	Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
BOBBY	What's his name?
HORRACE	Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
BOBBY	So, when's the drop.
HORRACE	To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.

BOBBY	How bad is it?
HORRACE	It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
BOBBY	When's it going down?
HORRACE	Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
BOBBY	Shit.

BOBBY	Why isn't Ruiz coming?
HORRACE	This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
BOBBY	What's that?
HORRACE	A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
BOBBY	Yeah.

BOBBY	So what do we do?
HORRACE	We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
BOBBY	Where is this happening?
HORRACE	We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.

HORRACE	Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
BOBBY	No.
HORRACE	Brooklyn.
BOBBY	Yeah?
HORRACE	He must have that shit troughed.
BOBBY	What do you mean 'troughed?'
HORRACE	Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
BOBBY	Ruiz tied in out there?
HORRACE	Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.

BOBBY	Heard of them.
HORRACE	They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
BOBBY	It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
HORRACE	And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.

BOBBY	Where we going?
HORRACE	Quick drop. In and out.
BOBBY	Where's Ricky?
HORRACE	Ricky's taken care of.
BOBBY	How so?
HORRACE	He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
BOBBY	That it?
HORRACE	That's it.

HORRACE	This is it.
BOBBY	Where's Ricky.
HORRACE	I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.

MAX	You like the ponies?
BOBBY	Sure. Yeah.
MAX	You bet the ponies?
BOBBY	Me? No. Not really.
MAX	Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
BOBBY	Why?
MAX	It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
BOBBY	This one?
MAX	Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
BOBBY	Pshhh...
MAX	A million. Easy.
BOBBY	She was fast, huh?
MAX	Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
BOBBY	That's why they call it the smart money.

MAX	I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
BOBBY	Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
MAX	Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
BOBBY	They were out of line --
MAX	They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
BOBBY	That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
MAX	Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
BOBBY	I'll work it off.
MAX	Not driving Jess, you won't.
BOBBY	What?
MAX	You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
BOBBY	So, that's it. I'm out?
MAX	I didn't say that.
BOBBY	Then what are you saying?
MAX	Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
BOBBY	I don't understand.
MAX	It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
BOBBY	I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
MAX	Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
BOBBY	No.
MAX	Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
BOBBY	I know.
MAX	Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
BOBBY	Yeah. Sorry.
MAX	I got a way we make everybody happy.
BOBBY	Yeah.
MAX	We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
BOBBY	Ruiz knows about this?
MAX	Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
BOBBY	What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
MAX	Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
BOBBY	You told him you liked him.
MAX	That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
BOBBY	He'll work it off.
MAX	I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
BOBBY	He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
MAX	You vouch for him?

BOBBY	Yeah. Sure.
MAX	How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
BOBBY	I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
MAX	You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
BOBBY	It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
MAX	Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
BOBBY	No. Okay. I'll think about it.

MAX	Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
BOBBY	Yeah.

BOBBY	Yes.
MAX	What is it?
BOBBY	You want --
MAX	Not you. I want Ricky to answer.

BOBBY	I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
BOBBY	You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
MAX	Yes. Goodbye.

BOBBY	There won't be a next thing.
MAX	Take a few days --
BOBBY	I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
MAX	I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --

RUIZ	That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
BOBBY	What drill?

RUIZ	'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
BOBBY	We get it. We're sorry.
RUIZ	Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.

RUIZ	Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
BOBBY	Good morning.

RUIZ	Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
BOBBY	Nah, man...

BOBBY	A bad heart.
RUIZ	I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.

BOBBY	What's the plan?
RUIZ	Tom, the Welsh dude --

RUIZ	Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
BOBBY	Where's the drop?
RUIZ	You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?

BOBBY	Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
JIMMY	Hi. I'm Jimmy.
BOBBY	Bobby.

BOBBY	What's that?
JIMMY	You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
BOBBY	I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
JIMMY	Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
BOBBY	Nah.
JIMMY	Traveling light. I like that.

BOBBY	Where is the Soho Grand?
JIMMY	Soho.

BOBBY	So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
JIMMY	Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
BOBBY	Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
JIMMY	You don't know where you're going?
BOBBY	No. Just the cross streets.
JIMMY	Well, this is the corner.

JIMMY	I can wait around if you want.
BOBBY	No. That's cool, man.

JIMMY	Spa?
BOBBY	Yeah.
JIMMY	Depends what night.

BOBBY	'Trustafarians?'
JIMMY	You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?

BOBBY	This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
JIMMY	Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
BOBBY	Yeah?
JIMMY	Understand me?
BOBBY	Yeah.

BOBBY	Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
JIMMY	Ricky's taken care of.
BOBBY	Taken care of?
JIMMY	Yeah, he's getting there on his own.

HISPANIC KID	Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
BOBBY	Excuse me, we need to make a call.
HISPANIC KID	I'm on the phone.
BOBBY	It's important.
HISPANIC KID	So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
BOBBY	Listen, man, we really gotta...
HISPANIC KID	I be off in a minute.  Say again...?

BOBBY	We're with Ruiz.
DOORMAN	Ruiz isn't here.
BOBBY	We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
DOORMAN	Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
BOBBY	Can you check?
DOORMAN	He's not here.

DOORMAN	Sorry, man, but...
BOBBY	Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
DOORMAN	Any time, bro.
BOBBY	Thanks.

RICKY	Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
BOBBY	What about boxing?
RICKY	What about it?
BOBBY	What are you saying?
RICKY	You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
BOBBY	So?
RICKY	So, it was a draw.
BOBBY	Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
RICKY	So, it's not a winning record.
BOBBY	It's not losing record.
RICKY	That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
BOBBY	Don't be shitty.
RICKY	How am I being shitty?
BOBBY	Don't be shitty.
RICKY	I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
BOBBY	I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
RICKY	Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
BOBBY	I'll page you.
RICKY	Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
BOBBY	Yeah. I know the number.
RICKY	Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
BOBBY	I know the number.
RICKY	I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
BOBBY	I got no idea.
RICKY	Ask if he said anything to her.
BOBBY	I will.
RICKY	I'll page you with the number.
BOBBY	Bye.

RICKY	So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
BOBBY	I thought you hate that club.
RICKY	I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
BOBBY	Then why do you try to get in?
RICKY	Fuck them.
BOBBY	Shhh...

BOBBY	Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
RICKY	Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...

RICKY	We need guns.
BOBBY	We don't need guns.
RICKY	I think we might.
BOBBY	He didn't say we need guns.
RICKY	He implied it.
BOBBY	You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.

RICKY	This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
BOBBY	No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
RICKY	Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
BOBBY	What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
RICKY	Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
BOBBY	Bullshit...
RICKY	Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
BOBBY	You wanna go right now?
RICKY	I'll beat your ass --

RICKY	Sorry coach.
BOBBY	Sorry coach.

BOBBY	We look good this year.
RICKY	We'll kill Fairfax this year.
BOBBY	I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
RICKY	Fuck him.
BOBBY	Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
RICKY	What are we delivering?
BOBBY	We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
RICKY	Who is this fucking Ruiz?
BOBBY	Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
RICKY	Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
BOBBY	I gotta pick up the baby.
RICKY	Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
BOBBY	I like it.
RICKY	It's not even yours.
BOBBY	I like it.

BOBBY	Nice work.
RICKY	Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
BOBBY	How'd you unlock my phone?
RICKY	I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
BOBBY	Seat belt.

RICKY	No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
BOBBY	C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
RICKY	Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
BOBBY	See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?

RICKY	Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
BOBBY	I promised Chloe we'd come here.
RICKY	Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
BOBBY	I'm not taking her to a bar.
RICKY	Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.

RICKY	What? Did she say something?
BOBBY	She wants you to paint the ashtray.
RICKY	I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.

BOBBY	Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
RICKY	Who's driving her?
BOBBY	I don't know.
RICKY	This paint sucks. The white shows through.

RICKY	Right here's fine.
BOBBY	Is that the woman from..?
RICKY	She really liked the kitchen.

BOBBY	It's ours.
RICKY	To keep?

RICKY	Holy shit. Can you believe this?
BOBBY	Pretty nice.
RICKY	See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
BOBBY	What's the movie?
RICKY	I'll get the girl.
BOBBY	Nah, don't bother --

RICKY	You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
BOBBY	We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
RICKY	Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
BOBBY	I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
RICKY	Oh, I'll represent alright.

BOBBY	Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
RICKY	Maybe we should call for a cab.
BOBBY	No. Look. There.

BOBBY	'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
RICKY	You sure?
BOBBY	Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.

BOBBY	Who you calling?
RICKY	Shhh... Hello, room service?
BOBBY	C'mon, man...
RICKY	Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
BOBBY	How much is it?
RICKY	How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
BOBBY	How much was it?
RICKY	Forty-six.
BOBBY	Jesus, man. Plus ten?
RICKY	Yeah, I guess.
BOBBY	Great. On my fucking room.
RICKY	Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
BOBBY	Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
RICKY	Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
BOBBY	Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
RICKY	But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
BOBBY	Oh really. Why's that?
RICKY	We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
BOBBY	Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
RICKY	Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.

BOBBY	What are you doing?
RICKY	What are you doing?
BOBBY	I know you're not calling Jimmy.
RICKY	As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
BOBBY	We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
RICKY	You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?

BOBBY	It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
RICKY	Well, I don't want to walk.

BOBBY	Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
RICKY	Fuck...

RICKY	What exactly did they say?
BOBBY	They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
RICKY	They didn't say an address?
BOBBY	I told you what they said.
RICKY	Nothing else.
BOBBY	Nothing.
RICKY	How'd they know who you were?
BOBBY	They asked who it was.
RICKY	So they said more than the address.
BOBBY	No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
RICKY	This is bullshit, man.
BOBBY	What the fuck do you...

BOBBY	What the fuck do you have to complain about?
RICKY	Don't even start.
BOBBY	No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
RICKY	Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
BOBBY	You sold it? I thought they stole it.
RICKY	Sold it, stole it, whatever...
BOBBY	Motherfucker...
RICKY	Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
BOBBY	You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
RICKY	Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
BOBBY	You just don't fucking get it, do you?
RICKY	You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
BOBBY	What the fuck is that supposed --
RICKY	I mean, that's what I heard --
BOBBY	You got something to say --

RICKY	You know this guy?
BOBBY	His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.

RICKY	This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
BOBBY	I don't know.
RICKY	Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
BOBBY	Missing what? He didn't say shit.
RICKY	Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
BOBBY	What did I 'get?'
RICKY	Yeah. What vibe?
BOBBY	I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
RICKY	Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
BOBBY	What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?

RICKY	So is this the drop?
BOBBY	Like I said, I don't know.
RICKY	He woulda told us right?
BOBBY	You would think.

BOBBY	Yeah.
RICKY	So we're working?

BOBBY	You happy?
RICKY	About what?
BOBBY	Why you gotta make everything difficult?
RICKY	You too?
BOBBY	Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
RICKY	Fuck this.

BOBBY	Where do you think you're going?
RICKY	Back in.
BOBBY	You fucking nuts?
RICKY	Work's over. I'm gonna party.
BOBBY	You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
RICKY	You got that right.
BOBBY	Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
RICKY	Fine.

RICKY	Look who's back? Want some champagne?
BOBBY	Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
RICKY	Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'

BOBBY	What the fuck's going on?
RICKY	Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
BOBBY	Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. 

BOBBY	What the hell did you do?
RICKY	I swear to God, I didn't do anything.

BOBBY	What the fuck was that about?
RICKY	She was jonesing for me.

BOBBY	Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
RICKY	What's up?
BOBBY	He wants to see us now.
RICKY	Where?
BOBBY	He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
RICKY	We're getting whacked.
BOBBY	We're not getting whacked.
RICKY	Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
BOBBY	It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.

BOBBY	What are you doing.
RICKY	I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
BOBBY	You gonna shank him in the shower?
RICKY	Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
BOBBY	We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.

BOBBY	Put that shit out...
RICKY	C'mon, man...
BOBBY	I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
RICKY	Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
BOBBY	Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?

BOBBY	Nothing, man.
RICKY	You want us strapped, don't you?

BOBBY	Let's do it.
RICKY	I'm your soldier.

RICKY	Let's check out the penguins.
BOBBY	The what?
RICKY	The penguin house.
BOBBY	Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
RICKY	Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
BOBBY	Did you hear what he just said?
RICKY	Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
BOBBY	I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.

RICKY	We need guns.
BOBBY	We don't need guns.
RICKY	I'm pretty sure we do.
BOBBY	I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
RICKY	All the more reason.
BOBBY	You wouldn't even know where to get one.
RICKY	Wanna bet?
BOBBY	You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
RICKY	That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
BOBBY	It was six in the fucking morning.
RICKY	Float me a hundred bucks.
BOBBY	Why?
RICKY	You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
BOBBY	You're out of money?
RICKY	No.
BOBBY	What do you have left?
RICKY	Eighty.
BOBBY	Eighty bucks?!?
RICKY	Eighty five.
BOBBY	What happened to the fifteen hundred?
RICKY	You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
BOBBY	I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
RICKY	You did?
BOBBY	Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
RICKY	What about it?
BOBBY	They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...

RICKY	Calm down.
BOBBY	I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
RICKY	This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
BOBBY	Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
RICKY	I'm sorry...
BOBBY	This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
RICKY	It's gonna be fine.
BOBBY	No more, man.
RICKY	Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
BOBBY	How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
RICKY	So what do we do?
BOBBY	Let's just go now and wait.
RICKY	Three and a half hours?
BOBBY	I don't want to take any more chances.
RICKY	Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
BOBBY	Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
RICKY	Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
BOBBY	Where do you get this shit?
RICKY	Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
BOBBY	You're not getting a gun.

RICKY	Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
BOBBY	Easy...

RICKY	Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
BOBBY	Take us right to Kennedy. Now.

RICKY	Dude, we were practically made...
BOBBY	I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
RICKY	No. I'll wait here.
BOBBY	I'll be a minute.

WELSHMAN	Hey, boys.
BOBBY	Tom. How's it going?
WELSHMAN	Fine, fine. And you were...?
BOBBY	Bobby and Ricky.
WELSHMAN	Right, right. The 'thugs.'

BOBBY	C'mon...
WELSHMAN	Fuck...

CYNTHIA	We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
RICKY	And you grew up in Manhattan?
CYNTHIA	Kinda. Yeah.
RICKY	What do you mean 'kinda?'

RICKY	I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
CYNTHIA	That's a good idea, maybe I will!

CYNTHIA	Where's the surprise?
RICKY	You want your surprise?
CYNTHIA	Yeah. I want it.
RICKY	Well, come on then. It's back here.

RICKY	You want to come splash around.
CYNTHIA	I'm just warning you, I can't swim.

CYNTHIA	I want to leave right now.
RICKY	I didn't do anything --

RICKY	Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
DOORMAN	The line's over there.
RICKY	Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
DOORMAN	How is it you're good? You on a list?
RICKY	Yeah. Ricky Slade.
DOORMAN	You see a Ricky Slade?

RICKY	Cardiff Giant?
DOORMAN	What?
RICKY	Cardiff Giant. Just check.
DOORMAN	Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
RICKY	Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
DOORMAN	Hey. I'm half Lebanese.

RICKY	Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
DOORMAN	He's on the list.
RICKY	Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.

DOORMAN	What's up, man.
SCREECH	S'up.
DOORMAN	You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
SCREECH	A little.
DOORMAN	You look good, man.
SCREECH	Cool. See you later.
DOORMAN	Cool.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Yes?
RICKY	Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
RICKY	Ugh...
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
RICKY	Yeah, sure. How much are they?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	How much is what?
RICKY	The videos.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	You're up front. Everything's free up here.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Yes?
RICKY	Drinks are free, right?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Yes.  Would you care for another one?
RICKY	Yes.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Yes.
RICKY	Where do you live?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	Excuse me.
RICKY	Where do you live?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT	I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
RICKY	Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.

RICKY	Where's Spa.
HORRACE	Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.

RICKY	How do you know it's not drugs?
HORRACE	Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
RICKY	You strapped?
HORRACE	'Strapped?'
RICKY	It means you got a gun?
HORRACE	I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.

HORRACE	Don't drag my ass into this --
RICKY	He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?

HORRACE	I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
RICKY	Why? What I say bad?
HORRACE	What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
RICKY	What? Why am I bad?

HORRACE	See you later.
RICKY	You really in trouble?
HORRACE	Stop.
RICKY	I'll tell him someone else told me.
HORRACE	Just don't ask me no more shit.

HORRACE	The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
RICKY	So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
HORRACE	Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
RICKY	Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.

RICKY	Ow, shit...
HORRACE	Watch it...

RICKY	I'm half Irish.
HORRACE	I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.

WELSHMAN	And where is...?
HORRACE	Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
WELSHMAN	No?
HORRACE	Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
WELSHMAN	Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
HORRACE	Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
WELSHMAN	Pity. What's say we have a drink?

HORRACE	No shit?
WELSHMAN	Does anyone want another?
HORRACE	You want another drink?

HORRACE	Sure. Anyplace in particular?
WELSHMAN	I hear the China Club is a laugh.

HORRACE	What do you want?
WELSHMAN	A little Charlie, perhaps.
HORRACE	Coke?
WELSHMAN	I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
HORRACE	That shouldn't be a problem.

WELSHMAN	Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
HORRACE	Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
WELSHMAN	No, really, mate?
HORRACE	Here...

WELSHMAN	Here they are, then.
HORRACE	How's it going?
WELSHMAN	Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
HORRACE	No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
WELSHMAN	Come, now. You just got here.
HORRACE	That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.

WELSHMAN	Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
HORRACE	Couldn't make it. Here's the money.

WELSHMAN	I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
HORRACE	No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.

WELSHMAN	I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
HORRACE	Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?

HORRACE	Yeah.
RUIZ	Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.

HORRACE	Good morning.
RUIZ	You think this shit's funny, Ho?
HORRACE	Nah, man...
RUIZ	You think it's funny, motherfucker?

RUIZ	Last thing I want is you with a gun.
HORRACE	Word.

RICKY	Ricky.
JIMMY	Soho Grand, right?

RICKY	Is it nice?
JIMMY	The Soho Grand?
RICKY	Yeah.
JIMMY	You're from LA, right?
RICKY	Yeah.
JIMMY	You'll love it.

RICKY	So whenever we want...
JIMMY	Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
RICKY	So you're our own private guy?
JIMMY	I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
RICKY	You know my pager number?
JIMMY	No. What is it?
RICKY	I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
JIMMY	The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.

RICKY	A lot of Persians?
JIMMY	Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.

RICKY	I call 'em wiggers.
JIMMY	Different.

LEO	Sure. You boys want anything?
RUIZ	Yeah, bring us four fernet.
LEO	Four fernet.

RUIZ	Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
LEO	We're square.
RUIZ	Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
LEO	Thanks.
RUIZ	You rode?

RICKY	Can I borrow a piece of --
MAX	Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --

MAX	dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
RICKY	We're going to New York?
MAX	Yes. You're going to New York.
RICKY	And the money. Where do we bring the money?
MAX	That money is your per diem.
RICKY	And where do we bring it?

RICKY	Yeah.
MAX	You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
RICKY	Keys.
MAX	What?
RICKY	What about my keys?
MAX	You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
RICKY	Yes.

RICKY	I get it.
MAX	Tell me.
RICKY	Don't worry. I get it.
MAX	So tell me how it is.
RICKY	You want... Why are you picking on me?
MAX	Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.

RICKY	So, wait, what are we dropping off?
MAX	Goodbye.

MAX	I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
RICKY	But, Max --
MAX	We're square.
RICKY	Yes, sir.
MAX	And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.

RICKY	No. I'll take a strega.
RUIZ	What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
RICKY	Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
RUIZ	Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
RICKY	It's a digestif.

RICKY	We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
RUIZ	Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?

RUIZ	What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
RICKY	She poured it for --
RUIZ	Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.

RUIZ	What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
RICKY	Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?

RICKY	No...
RUIZ	Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
RICKY	He has a cute what...?

RICKY	Who's gonna outfit us?
RUIZ	Outfit? What's he talking about?

RICKY	The Red Dragon.
RUIZ	Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
RICKY	So, we're talking money laundering...
RUIZ	Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.

RICKY	Yeah.
RUIZ	What?
RICKY	When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
RUIZ	That's none of your fucking business.

WELSHMAN	And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
RICKY	So, you must be the Red Dragon.

WELSHMAN	Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
RICKY	Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
WELSHMAN	Edinburgh.
RICKY	And where might that be?
WELSHMAN	Scotland.
RICKY	Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
WELSHMAN	I am.
RICKY	A rose by any other name would --

RICKY	Dip?
WELSHMAN	Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.

RICKY	I'll get it.
WELSHMAN	Who's up for a night on the town.

ALTHEA	What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
MUMFORD	Me more than most.
ALTHEA	Why are they ganging up against me?
MUMFORD	I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
ALTHEA	It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
MUMFORD	How did they threaten you?
ALTHEA	They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
MUMFORD	Good kids.

ALTHEA	Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
MUMFORD	Hmm?

ALTHEA	I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
MUMFORD	Really? You think so?
ALTHEA	Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.

ALTHEA	-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
MUMFORD	I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
ALTHEA	I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
MUMFORD	Uh-huh. What are they?
ALTHEA	Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
MUMFORD	One hundred books?
ALTHEA	It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
MUMFORD	What happened?

ALTHEA	We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
MUMFORD	You must have been concerned.
ALTHEA	It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
MUMFORD	Doubtful. What did he say?
ALTHEA	He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.

ALTHEA	I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
MUMFORD	Take your time.
ALTHEA	-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.

MUMFORD	You can go out there if you like...
ALTHEA	There's no shame in getting a little therapy, right, Doc?

COOK	Dr. Mumford.
MUMFORD	Mr. Cook.
COOK	Could you come with me please?

COOK	I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
MUMFORD	Uh-huh.
COOK	It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
MUMFORD	What's that?
COOK	We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
MUMFORD	Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
COOK	That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
MUMFORD	No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
COOK	Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
MUMFORD	Why's that?
COOK	Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
MUMFORD	Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.

COOK	I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
MUMFORD	Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.

MUMFORD	Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
COOK	Were you supposed to have a session?
MUMFORD	No. It's sort of spur of the moment.

COOK	Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
MUMFORD	A friend?

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER	Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
MUMFORD	I'm fine.
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER	You're the shrink, aren't you?
MUMFORD	No, not really.
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER	But you do therapy?
MUMFORD	Not any more.

DELBANCO	What an asshole!
SHEELER	Ernest, what do you think?
DELBANCO	I think he's got a point.

SHEELER	Thank you.
DELBANCO	You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.

SHEELER	What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
DELBANCO	...And I from Phyllis.
SHEELER	So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?

SHEELER	But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
DELBANCO	It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.

SHEELER	You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
DELBANCO	Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?

DELBANCO	Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
SHEELER	No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...

MUMFORD	Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
DELBANCO	I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
MUMFORD	Of course... I've heard great things about you.

DELBANCO	What are you doing for lunch?
MUMFORD	Right now?

DELBANCO	I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
MUMFORD	Are we?

MUMFORD	My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
DELBANCO	I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?

DELBANCO	Interesting approach. What was his name?
MUMFORD	Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.

DELBANCO	We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
MUMFORD	My approach?

DELBANCO	...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
MUMFORD	How do you mean?

DELBANCO	Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
MUMFORD	What kind of doubts?
DELBANCO	About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.

MUMFORD	I see.
DELBANCO	And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
MUMFORD	What's that?
DELBANCO	Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
MUMFORD	Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
DELBANCO	As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.

FOLLETT	I have eighteen more minutes!
MUMFORD	I don't want to hear any more today.
FOLLETT	Why not?
MUMFORD	Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
FOLLETT	Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
MUMFORD	Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
FOLLETT	Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
MUMFORD	Good, then go.

FOLLETT	Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
MUMFORD	Mr. Follett.
FOLLETT	-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
MUMFORD	Henry!

FOLLETT	What?
MUMFORD	Stop now.
FOLLETT	Why? I'm paying for this.
MUMFORD	Not for this. Not me, you're not.
FOLLETT	You find it distasteful, don't you?
MUMFORD	It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
FOLLETT	I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
MUMFORD	You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
FOLLETT	No?
MUMFORD	You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
FOLLETT	I never said that.

MUMFORD	Where's your wife, Henry?
FOLLETT	Go to hell.
MUMFORD	I didn't hear you.

FOLLETT	We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
MUMFORD	What?!

FOLLETT	I was... never satisfied.
MUMFORD	Now we're back on track.

MUMFORD	What's that?
FOLLETT	You are so mean.

FOLLETT	What is it?
MUMFORD	It's a thought I had.
FOLLETT	Should I open it now?

MUMFORD	Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
FOLLETT	What exactly is it supposed to do?
MUMFORD	You remember when I asked you about pornography --
FOLLETT	-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
MUMFORD	-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
FOLLETT	-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
MUMFORD	But you did come to me.

MUMFORD	My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
FOLLETT	And the experiment is in here?

FOLLETT	Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
MUMFORD	There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --

FOLLETT	Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
MUMFORD	My pleasure.

MUMFORD	I feel like we're making real progress here.
FOLLETT	Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --

MUMFORD	I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
GILROY	My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.

GILROY	It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
MUMFORD	Do you want to come in?
GILROY	No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
MUMFORD	Mr. Gilroy --

MUMFORD	What brought this on?
GILROY	I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.

JEREMY	You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
MUMFORD	Doc. Nice to meet you.
JEREMY	Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.

JEREMY	I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
MUMFORD	Nope.

JEREMY	Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
MUMFORD	I've had my moments.
JEREMY	I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
MUMFORD	I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
JEREMY	Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
MUMFORD	What do you do?
JEREMY	Althea hasn't told you?
MUMFORD	We've been talking about her, mostly.
JEREMY	Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
MUMFORD	You've done well.

JEREMY	We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
MUMFORD	A little.
JEREMY	Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
MUMFORD	Tastes good.
JEREMY	No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
MUMFORD	What do you think's wrong with her?
JEREMY	She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.

JEREMY	You're the doctor, what do you think?
MUMFORD	She seems very unhappy.

JUDGE OTTO	Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
MUMFORD	I do.
JUDGE OTTO	Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...

JUDGE OTTO	...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
MUMFORD	Yes, your honor.
JUDGE OTTO	It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
MUMFORD	Yes.

JUDGE OTTO	Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
MUMFORD	I'm sorry, your honor.
JUDGE OTTO	What?
MUMFORD	I'm sorry you're frustrated.
JUDGE OTTO	Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
MUMFORD	No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
JUDGE OTTO	Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.

SKIP	Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
LILY	Oh?
SKIP	Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.

LILY	I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
SKIP	What?

SKIP	So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
LILY	I'd better get in there.
SKIP	That's a lot of people all at once.
LILY	It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
SKIP	What are they?

LILY	Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
SKIP	Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
LILY	You do?
SKIP	Yeah.
LILY	Well, come on in.

LILY	You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
MUMFORD	My patient had to leave early.
LILY	Who was that?

MUMFORD	Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
LILY	I think it's like... inquisitive.
MUMFORD	It was Henry Follett.
LILY	Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
MUMFORD	What do you want to know?
LILY	You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.

LILY	How long you been in this town?
MUMFORD	Oh, I don't know...
LILY	Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
MUMFORD	Lily, I don't think even you could know that --

LILY	You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
MUMFORD	Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.

LILY	So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
MUMFORD	You like me. How come?
LILY	Not sure. Let me think about it.

MUMFORD	How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
LILY	Doc.  Ainge...

LILY	Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
MUMFORD	It's a pretty piece of land.

LILY	And the Brocketts?
MUMFORD	Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
LILY	It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
MUMFORD	...And?
LILY	Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
MUMFORD	Why do you watch?
LILY	No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.

LILY	They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
MUMFORD	Where am I supposed to eat?
LILY	You're on your own today, honey.

MUMFORD	Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
LILY	It's a pleasure to meet you.

MUMFORD	...so rich?
LILY	...so accomplished.

LILY	Doc...
MUMFORD	Lily.
LILY	Doc.

LILY	I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
MUMFORD	He told you.
LILY	Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
MUMFORD	You would have met in some shower eventually...
LILY	I want to give you something. Will you let me?
MUMFORD	Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
LILY	Yes, you do, you damn well do.
MUMFORD	Okay.
LILY	Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
MUMFORD	That's it? That's what you're giving me?
LILY	Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.

MUMFORD	What it might take is... doing time.
LILY	Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.

MUMFORD	-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
LIONEL	Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...

LIONEL	...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
MUMFORD	-- Go on!

LIONEL	-- you crazy? You can't do this!
MUMFORD	Sure I can, Lionel.
LIONEL	I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
MUMFORD	See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.

LIONEL	Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
MUMFORD	Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?

LIONEL	Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
MUMFORD	And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.

MUMFORD	Hello, Lionel.
LIONEL	You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
MUMFORD	You're right, as usual. See you.

LIONEL	It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
MUMFORD	Thanks for your help, Lionel.

MARTIN	But you know how to drive?
MUMFORD	Sure.
MARTIN	Got a license?  But no car?
MUMFORD	Don't need it.
MARTIN	I just got my license two weeks ago.
MUMFORD	You're good.
MARTIN	I been drivin' since I was twelve.
MUMFORD	That would explain it.
MARTIN	Can you help Mom?
MUMFORD	I'm trying.
MARTIN	Got to.

MARTIN	What's wrong with her?
MUMFORD	Is she a friend of yours?
MARTIN	No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot.

MARTIN	Hiya, Doc.
MUMFORD	Martin.
MARTIN	Did you straighten her out?

MUMFORD	How are you?
MARTIN	Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.

SOFIE	Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
MRS. COOK	Mumford... like the town?

MRS. COOK	What's happening here?
SOFIE	We're going for a walk.
MRS. COOK	Do you think that's a good idea?
SOFIE	Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
MRS. COOK	What kind of doctor are you?

MRS. COOK	It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
SOFIE	Mother... go away!

MUMFORD	Ph.D., psychologist.
MRS. COOK	Oh... not a real doctor.
MUMFORD	That's right, the fake kind.

MRS. COOK	What'd you want?
MUMFORD	There's something I think we need to talk about.
MRS. COOK	What?

MRS. COOK	Finally, some common sense...
MUMFORD	What do you mean?
MRS. COOK	I think you know what I mean.
MUMFORD	No, I really don't.
MRS. COOK	I think you do.
MUMFORD	Why don't you tell me?
MRS. COOK	Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.

MUMFORD	Well... you see, the problem is --
MRS. COOK	-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.

MUMFORD	Wow. You're something.
MRS. COOK	Take a hike, Dr. Quack!

MRS. COOK	Well, look who's here...
MUMFORD	Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
MRS. COOK	Just who is here, can you tell me?
MUMFORD	Could I see Sofie, please?
MRS. COOK	No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.

MRS. COOK	Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
MUMFORD	Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.

MUMFORD	Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
SOFIE	I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.

MUMFORD	What can you tell me about this?
SOFIE	Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.

MUMFORD	When did you start to feel this way?
SOFIE	About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.

MUMFORD	What?
SOFIE	You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
MUMFORD	No.
SOFIE	I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.

SOFIE	That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
MUMFORD	Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
SOFIE	No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
MUMFORD	Hmm.
SOFIE	Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
MUMFORD	Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
SOFIE	Even if you don't think it's real?
MUMFORD	I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
SOFIE	What would you do?
MUMFORD	We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
SOFIE	I don't know. I barely made it today.
MUMFORD	I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.

MUMFORD	We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
SOFIE	I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
MUMFORD	We'll work it out.

SOFIE	You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
MUMFORD	No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
SOFIE	Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
MUMFORD	Maybe you'll catch it.
SOFIE	Can I ask you something?  Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  So what changed?

SOFIE	I'm not making any promises.
MUMFORD	We'll turn back anytime you want.
SOFIE	Oh boy... this should be interesting.

SOFIE	Mom's such a cutie.
MUMFORD	People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
SOFIE	She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
MUMFORD	Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
SOFIE	Is that the technical description of what I've got?
MUMFORD	Is she against you getting help?
SOFIE	We don't discuss it.
MUMFORD	Something's bothering her.
SOFIE	Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...

MUMFORD	Please... forgive me.
SOFIE	What?
MUMFORD	Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?

MUMFORD	Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
SOFIE	You've got a funny idea of funny.
MUMFORD	I've offended you!
SOFIE	No.
MUMFORD	Really? What would it take?

SOFIE	Is this the treatment?
MUMFORD	Sorry... I'm done.
SOFIE	'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.

SOFIE	I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
MUMFORD	Be specific.
SOFIE	Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...

MUMFORD	Sore throat?
SOFIE	Uh-huh.

MUMFORD	Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
SOFIE	Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
MUMFORD	Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
SOFIE	Where?
MUMFORD	Life.

SOFIE	I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
MUMFORD	Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
SOFIE	No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
MUMFORD	So the headaches may not even be a part of this?

MUMFORD	I can give myself a headache instantly.
SOFIE	Is that like a party trick?
MUMFORD	All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'

MUMFORD	There... I've given myself a real whopper.
SOFIE	You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
MUMFORD	Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
SOFIE	Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.

MUMFORD	You're doing great.
SOFIE	I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
MUMFORD	It doesn't matter. Go on.
SOFIE	Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?

SOFIE	You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
MUMFORD	Yes.
SOFIE	...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
MUMFORD	Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.

SOFIE	That was really bad, wasn't it?
MUMFORD	Disgusting.
SOFIE	And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
MUMFORD	It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.

MUMFORD	Is that when you split up?
SOFIE	No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.

SOFIE	So whose route is this?
MUMFORD	Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
SOFIE	And he's where?
MUMFORD	In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
SOFIE	I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
MUMFORD	You like it?
SOFIE	It's all right.
MUMFORD	Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
SOFIE	And this is legitimate therapy?
MUMFORD	Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.

SOFIE	When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
MUMFORD	That's what I like.
SOFIE	Which thing?
MUMFORD	Either one.
SOFIE	Why'd you come to the house the other night?
MUMFORD	I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
SOFIE	My brother said you were about to fire me.
MUMFORD	That's one way to put it.
SOFIE	I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
MUMFORD	I thought only action movies had villains like that.

SOFIE	-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
MUMFORD	Yeah?
SOFIE	I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
MUMFORD	That's... good?
SOFIE	Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
MUMFORD	I don't know if --
SOFIE	You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
MUMFORD	Of course.
SOFIE	Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.

SOFIE	I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
MUMFORD	Of course.

SOFIE	It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
MUMFORD	Is something wrong, Sofie?
SOFIE	Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
MUMFORD	You're upset.
SOFIE	How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.

MUMFORD	Is it something you've heard about me?
SOFIE	No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
MUMFORD	Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?

SOFIE	All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
MUMFORD	Um-huh.
SOFIE	First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
MUMFORD	I'm glad.
SOFIE	Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
MUMFORD	I don't follow you.
SOFIE	I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
MUMFORD	Okay...
SOFIE	The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
MUMFORD	I think so.
SOFIE	I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
MUMFORD	What was that?
SOFIE	Transference!
MUMFORD	Transference.
SOFIE	Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.

SOFIE	Hello?
MUMFORD	Hello.
SOFIE	I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --

SOFIE	Mother...
MUMFORD	What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?

MUMFORD	I guess you saw the show...?
SOFIE	Which show was that?
MUMFORD	Sofie...
SOFIE	Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
MUMFORD	You probably got the idea.

SOFIE	...How violated I feel?
MUMFORD	You're not the only one...

SOFIE	You feel violated?
MUMFORD	Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
SOFIE	You deserve it.

SOFIE	I am irate!
MUMFORD	But...
SOFIE	But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
MUMFORD	I know it! Please believe me, I know that...

MUMFORD	But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
SOFIE	What?
MUMFORD	Will you think about it?
SOFIE	I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
MUMFORD	I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.

SOFIE	Oh.
MUMFORD	I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.

SOFIE	...but first, you have to tell me something...
MUMFORD	Anything... just ask.
SOFIE	What is your name?

SOFIE	You got off easy.
MUMFORD	Will you wait for me?
SOFIE	We're only talking about six weeks.
MUMFORD	Will you be here?
SOFIE	Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.

NESSA	...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
MUMFORD	What do you mean, "in no time"?
NESSA	In maybe three or four issues.
MUMFORD	Weekly or monthly?
NESSA	Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
MUMFORD	Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
NESSA	Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
MUMFORD	It's a big part of the show.

NESSA	The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
MUMFORD	It's called pro bono.
NESSA	Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
MUMFORD	It's my bit for the community.
NESSA	Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
MUMFORD	Where was this?
NESSA	Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
MUMFORD	You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
NESSA	Have women found you attractive?

NESSA	I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
MUMFORD	That's not quite what I said --
NESSA	It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...

NESSA	Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
MUMFORD	What do you want me to see?
NESSA	Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.

NESSA	What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
MUMFORD	If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
NESSA	I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
MUMFORD	What happened today?
NESSA	What are you talking about?
MUMFORD	Was it something that happened at school?
NESSA	These appointments were not my idea, remember.
MUMFORD	True. Should we stop them?

NESSA	I don't think you know what you're talking about.
MUMFORD	Uh-huh.
NESSA	This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?

NESSA	There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
MUMFORD	Do you think that's what he wants?
NESSA	No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.

NESSA	...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
MUMFORD	What'd he say?
NESSA	He said -- "Which we already knew!"

MUMFORD	What did he want you to do?
NESSA	First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --

NESSA	...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
MUMFORD	No again?
NESSA	I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
MUMFORD	Really?
NESSA	I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
MUMFORD	He agreed?
NESSA	He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.

SKIP	You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
MUMFORD	How are you?
SKIP	Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.

SKIP	..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
MUMFORD	No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
SKIP	Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.

SKIP	Would you like another beer?
MUMFORD	Nah... scotch.
SKIP	Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?

MUMFORD	Can I ask you a personal question?
SKIP	Of course! That's exactly what I want.
MUMFORD	Have you thought about getting a wife?

SKIP	I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
MUMFORD	Is that the question?
SKIP	You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right?  Far out.

SKIP	I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
MUMFORD	I understand.
SKIP	I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
MUMFORD	Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
SKIP	I've got three big ones.
MUMFORD	I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
SKIP	No, no... I have three billion dollars.

SKIP	This is great!
SKIP	This is exactly what I wanted.
MUMFORD	Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
SKIP	You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
MUMFORD	Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
SKIP	Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.

MUMFORD	So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
SKIP	Don't you like this?
MUMFORD	Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
SKIP	Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
MUMFORD	Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
SKIP	No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
MUMFORD	She's probably ten years older than you.
SKIP	Good-looking woman.
MUMFORD	Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
SKIP	Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
MUMFORD	Well, there's Lily.
SKIP	Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
MUMFORD	Amazing.
SKIP	Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
MUMFORD	What kind of person do you have to be to do this?

SKIP	What?
MUMFORD	This --

SKIP	So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
MUMFORD	Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.

MUMFORD	Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
SKIP	Uh-huh.
MUMFORD	Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
SKIP	I wondered what happened to her...

MUMFORD	Hey, Skip.
SKIP	Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
MUMFORD	That's all right. What's on your mind?

SKIP	How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
MUMFORD	Yep.

SKIP	I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
MUMFORD	Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
SKIP	You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
MUMFORD	It's just a thought.

SKIP	Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
MUMFORD	You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
SKIP	I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?

SKIP	Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
MUMFORD	-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
SKIP	Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --

SKIP	All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
MUMFORD	You are Panda, monarch of modems.
SKIP	That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
MUMFORD	Okay... let's say that, for now.
SKIP	It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?

SKIP	Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
MUMFORD	Jerking off?
SKIP	No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.

MUMFORD	Slash what?
SKIP	Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
MUMFORD	A doll?
SKIP	No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.

MUMFORD	How's it coming?
SKIP	You don't think I'm insane?
MUMFORD	And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
SKIP	No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
MUMFORD	Sounds like kind of a good idea.
SKIP	Really?
MUMFORD	Definitely.

MUMFORD	Skip, that's not much of a secret.
SKIP	It's not?
MUMFORD	Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.

SKIP	Who else knows?
MUMFORD	Just you.
SKIP	It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?

SKIP	Damn! What is your name?
MUMFORD	Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
SKIP	It matters to me.

SKIP	I've told you a lot of private stuff.
MUMFORD	I can tell you anything else.
SKIP	What about everything? How did this happen?

MUMFORD	But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
SKIP	Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --

SKIP	-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
MUMFORD	Everybody has a story, Skip.
SKIP	Sounds like you have several.
MUMFORD	What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
SKIP	An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
MUMFORD	It wasn't the best situation.
SKIP	Did you carry a gun?
MUMFORD	Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.

MUMFORD	Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
SKIP	Holy shit!

MUMFORD	Get to know your therapist.
SKIP	You were messed up, man.
MUMFORD	But look at me now...
SKIP	Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --

SKIP	At least you pulled yourself out...
MUMFORD	Things got a lot worse.
SKIP	You and Candy...?

SKIP	And the drugs?
MUMFORD	Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...

SKIP	Somebody's taking a shower down there.
MUMFORD	That'd be Lily.
SKIP	I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
MUMFORD	Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
SKIP	How'd you do it?  The new you.
MUMFORD	You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
SKIP	I know it starts with a birth certificate...
MUMFORD	All new people start with that...

MUMFORD	What about it?
SKIP	Mumford... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
MUMFORD	Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...

SKIP	And a birth certificate is enough?
MUMFORD	Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.

SKIP	But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
MUMFORD	No... no training.
SKIP	Psych major?
MUMFORD	English Lit.
SKIP	Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
MUMFORD	I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.

SKIP	Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
MUMFORD	See you Thursday... regular time.

SKIP	I've never brought anyone down here before.
MUMFORD	I'm honored.
SKIP	Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
MUMFORD	You're completely reliable.

MUMFORD	Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
SKIP	You want my advice? Far out!

SKIP	Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
MUMFORD	Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
SKIP	This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
MUMFORD	There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
SKIP	It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
MUMFORD	Really?
SKIP	It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
MUMFORD	What'd I do?

SKIP	Lily.
MUMFORD	Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
SKIP	Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.

SKIP	Sorry...
MUMFORD	Wow.

SKIP	I'm here for you, Doc.
MUMFORD	Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
SKIP	I guess that makes sense.
MUMFORD	Yes, yes it does...

SKIP	Doc!... It's not me, is it?
MUMFORD	What?

SKIP	Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
MUMFORD	Yep.

MUMFORD	Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
SHEELER	When?
MUMFORD	Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?

MUMFORD	It's possible. I don't know about that.
SHEELER	I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
MUMFORD	Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.

SHEELER	I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
MUMFORD	Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
SHEELER	Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
MUMFORD	Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.

SHEELER	That was a terrible thing.
MUMFORD	I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.

SHEELER	Yes... your particular approach.
MUMFORD	I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.

BALLARD	How is she?
DOCTOR	She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
BALLARD	Could I have that in American?
DOCTOR	It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
BALLARD	So she did witness it?

BALLARD	Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
DOCTOR	I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
BALLARD	No... Friends from the diner maybe?
DOCTOR	Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...

BETTY	Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
BALLARD	Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
BETTY	...I meant your food.
BALLARD	Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.

BETTY	I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
BALLARD	BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
BETTY	IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
BALLARD	GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
BETTY	I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!

BETTY	Sheriff, I don't...
BALLARD	C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...

BALLARD	Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
ROY	You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
BALLARD	Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...

ROY	I thought you said the eggs weren't...
BALLARD	It's fine. Mind your own meal...
ROY	You should get the order you want.
BALLARD	And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.

BALLARD	Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
ROY	They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
BALLARD	...plenty
ROY	Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
BALLARD	Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...

BALLARD	Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
ROY	Oww! My arm, careful!
BALLARD	Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
ROY	No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
BALLARD	Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
ROY	I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
BALLARD	...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
ROY	No, Elden, I need to...
BALLARD	You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
ROY	She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
BALLARD	It wasn't a woman.
ROY	Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
BALLARD	I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!

ROY	Jesus...
BALLARD	You think a woman did that?!

ROY	So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
BALLARD	They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
ROY	Did you send anyone out there?
BALLARD	You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
ROY	Bad idea...
BALLARD	You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
ROY	You better handle what's in this garbage can first.

BALLARD	I questioned Joyce about all this...
ROY	Yeah?
BALLARD	Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
ROY	...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
BALLARD	Junior year!
ROY	Anyway, so what?
BALLARD	So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
ROY	You said a woman couldn't have done it.
BALLARD	A woman can write a check.
ROY	So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
BALLARD	'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.

ROY	Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
BALLARD	That's it! YOU'RE GONE!

ROY	Oww, the arm, the arm!
BALLARD	You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
ROY	One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
BALLARD	That's right, you have the right to remain silent.

ROY	What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
BALLARD	No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
ROY	You're lying!
BALLARD	I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
ROY	That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
BALLARD	I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.

BALLARD	What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
ROY	We think we know where Betty is.
BALLARD	Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?

ROY	I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
BALLARD	Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
ROY	Tell him what you told me.

BALLARD	Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
ROY	Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.

ROY	Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
BALLARD	She said she was in Arizona, did she?

ROY	Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
BALLARD	I know that...
ROY	Well, do something, then, damnit!
BALLARD	You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.

ROY	Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
BALLARD	No, I didn't have to.

ROY	Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
BALLARD	That's a nice name for what you need...
ROY	Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?

BALLARD	Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
ROY	What about it?
BALLARD	Any idea where it is?
ROY	Little place called "Williams," why?
BALLARD	I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
ROY	I know plenty.

ROY	That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
BALLARD	Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
ROY	-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --

BALLARD	We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
ROY	YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.

BALLARD	We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
ROY	I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
BALLARD	You gotta go, we're pinned down!

ROY	You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
BALLARD	No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
ROY	I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.

JOYCE	Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
BETTY	Banners?
JOYCE	You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.

JOYCE	Need something else?
BETTY	No, I was just... How you doing?
JOYCE	Great. Good. Content...
BETTY	Oh. How come?
JOYCE	I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
BETTY	They're fine... you miss it?
JOYCE	You must be joking.
BETTY	Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
JOYCE	Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
BETTY	'Kay, good. Bye, then...
JOYCE	Uh-huh.  Anyway, I'm thinking Easter, 'cause I just fucking love pastels.

CHARLIE	Who are these idiots?
BETTY	This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
CHARLIE	Oh, this is wonderful...

BETTY	...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
CHARLIE	No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.

CHARLIE	Do you know who I am?
BETTY	...I... I know what you are.
CHARLIE	Do you know why I'm here?
BETTY	I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...

CHARLIE	You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
BETTY	I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
CHARLIE	So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
BETTY	Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
CHARLIE	Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.

BETTY	...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
CHARLIE	...to see you.

CHARLIE	...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
BETTY	I am?
CHARLIE	Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.

CHARLIE	I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
BETTY	Umm, I don't think that...
CHARLIE	Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
BETTY	Thirty-two?
CHARLIE	Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
BETTY	I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
CHARLIE	No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.

BETTY	I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
CHARLIE	I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
BETTY	I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
CHARLIE	Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...

CHARLIE	That's my son! My son is dead!
BETTY	I'm sorry.
CHARLIE	You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
BETTY	WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!

CHARLIE	If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
BETTY	I better go check on them.
CHARLIE	Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
BETTY	This is really awkward...

CHARLIE	Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
BETTY	I'd rather not...
CHARLIE	Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
BETTY	...what're you saying?
CHARLIE	When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.

CHARLIE	Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
BETTY	Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.

CHARLIE	So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
BETTY	I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
CHARLIE	Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
BETTY	I don't think I am.

CHIEF NURSE	Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
BETTY	Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
CHIEF NURSE	Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
BETTY	Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
CHIEF NURSE	...I don't think I know that hospital.
BETTY	It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
CHIEF NURSE	Really? You've just described all of Southern California.

CHIEF NURSE	What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
BETTY	Yes, ma'am.
CHIEF NURSE	Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...

CHIEF NURSE	You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
BETTY	Umm... yes. Back home.
CHIEF NURSE	Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.

BETTY	Did you watch it yet?
SUE ANN	Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
BETTY	Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
SUE ANN	Oh, Betty --
BETTY	I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
SUE ANN	Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
BETTY	No... what about your sister?
SUE ANN	I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.

BETTY	It's all right.
SUE ANN	You sure? Maybe next week we could...
BETTY	Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...

SUE ANN	Aahhh...  So what color is it?
BETTY	What?
SUE ANN	The LeSabre!
BETTY	Maroon.  I stole it.
SUE ANN	What?
BETTY	He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
SUE ANN	Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
BETTY	Yeah, me too.
SUE ANN	Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
BETTY	I gotta go make dinner.

SUE ANN	Let me know if you need anything, okay?
BETTY	Are you and Larry happy?
SUE ANN	Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
BETTY	Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
SUE ANN	All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
BETTY	All the time...
SUE ANN	Well, you are.

BETTY	Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
SUE ANN	Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
BETTY	Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...

SUE ANN	Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
BETTY	Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
SUE ANN	Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
BETTY	What are you talking about?

BETTY	Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
SUE ANN	Do what?
BETTY	I gotta go.
SUE ANN	Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...

BETTY	...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
GEORGE	I take it I should. I'm sorry.
BETTY	We were engaged.

GEORGE	I beg your pardon?
BETTY	But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.

GEORGE	That's very kind of you.
BETTY	The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --

GEORGE	Oh, you mean Fred.
BETTY	No, Del.
GEORGE	Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
BETTY	You knew Del?!
GEORGE	Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
BETTY	He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!

GEORGE	I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
BETTY	There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
GEORGE	You never gave us a chance...
BETTY	I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.

BETTY	Why do they keep calling you George?
GEORGE	I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?

GEORGE	I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
BETTY	Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.

BETTY	Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
GEORGE	You're late, Eric.

BETTY	Lyla's very nice.
GEORGE	Yes, she is.
BETTY	She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
GEORGE	She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
BETTY	Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
GEORGE	Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
BETTY	You told me that two hours ago.

BETTY	I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
GEORGE	What happened when you were twelve?
BETTY	For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
GEORGE	Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
BETTY	I just want everything to be perfect between us.
GEORGE	I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
BETTY	Of course.
GEORGE	At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
BETTY	I know. It's up to us.

GEORGE	I don't think your friend likes me.
BETTY	She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
GEORGE	Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.

BETTY	You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
GEORGE	Didn't I?
BETTY	No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...

GEORGE	I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
BETTY	I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
GEORGE	No, I mean your dedication scares me...
BETTY	It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
GEORGE	Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
BETTY	...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
GEORGE	Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
BETTY	Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
GEORGE	You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
BETTY	I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
GEORGE	Yes... maybe it was.

GEORGE	Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
BETTY	Ad lib?
GEORGE	In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.

BETTY	David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
GEORGE	Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.

BETTY	Why are you doing this to me?
GEORGE	Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?

GEORGE	Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
BETTY	What do you mean? What did I do to you...
GEORGE	Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
BETTY	David, please --
GEORGE	STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!

BETTY	I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
GEORGE	...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...

GEORGE	But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
BETTY	Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
GEORGE	You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
BETTY	No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.

GEORGE	Oh. Of course... sorry.
BETTY	My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
GEORGE	Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
BETTY	Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
GEORGE	I have... did it sound that bad?
BETTY	Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
GEORGE	George...
BETTY	...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
GEORGE	Thanks...
BETTY	...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.

BETTY	So, call me when you --
DEL	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
BETTY	Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
DEL	I ran back in to get the phone.

BETTY	I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
DEL	What's so special about it?

BETTY	What was that?
DEL	Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.

BETTY	Sure you don't want any salad?
DEL	No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
BETTY	I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
DEL	She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
BETTY	I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
DEL	All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.

BETTY	...like the water purifiers?
DEL	What?
BETTY	Or the vitamins? Or the...?

DEL	Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
BETTY	I got you, Del...
DEL	...well, then you ain't got much.
BETTY	Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
DEL	Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.

DEL	And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
BETTY	Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
DEL	They're new to us...

DEL	It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
BETTY	Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
DEL	That is a skill!

DEL	Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
BETTY	I came for love...
DEL	You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
BETTY	It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
DEL	That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
BETTY	I don't know.
DEL	You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.

ROY	Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
BETTY	Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
ROY	Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...

ROY	Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
BETTY	I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
ROY	Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
BETTY	Make sure it's elevated...
ROY	Uh-huh.
BETTY	You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...

BETTY	What're you doing here, Roy?
ROY	Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
BETTY	Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
ROY	My God... did you get a look at who did it?
BETTY	Yes.
ROY	You did? Was it anyone that you...?
BETTY	It was Chloe...

ROY	Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
BETTY	Roy! What are you doing here?
ROY	You're in serious danger!
BETTY	Ahh, look, right now's not very...
ROY	I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.

ROY	Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
BETTY	It's not really a good time, guys...

ELLEN	What's the matter here?
BETTY	I begged him to let me put that on!
ELLEN	He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.

ELLEN	So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
BETTY	Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...

ELLEN	Shut up, Merle... Williams.
BETTY	Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.

ELLEN	If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
BETTY	I'd slap his face.
ELLEN	I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.

ELLEN	Where you headed, Betty?
BETTY	Los Angeles, California.
ELLEN	And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
BETTY	Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
ELLEN	I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
BETTY	Did you love it?
ELLEN	Sure I loved it! It was great.

ELLEN	Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
BETTY	That's horrible!
ELLEN	No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.

BETTY	I left my husband two days ago.
ELLEN	Really?
BETTY	I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
ELLEN	Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
BETTY	Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
ELLEN	Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
BETTY	No. Loma Vista.
ELLEN	I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
BETTY	How did you know?
ELLEN	What's his real name?
BETTY	Dr. David Ravell.
ELLEN	You mean... George McCord, the actor?
BETTY	No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.

ELLEN	Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
BETTY	I'll go to the Hospital.
ELLEN	What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
BETTY	Like Rome?
ELLEN	Worse.
BETTY	You made out alright.
ELLEN	Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...

BETTY	Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
ELLEN	You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
BETTY	To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...

LYLA	I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
BETTY	Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
LYLA	I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.

BETTY	Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
LYLA	No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
BETTY	I married a car salesman.

LYLA	She called you 'George,' George.
BETTY	...did I win some contest?

ROSA	What are you doing?
BETTY	He has no heartbeat!
ROSA	You're hurting him!!
BETTY	I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
ROSA	ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
BETTY	LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!

ROSA	You don't sound like you're from here.
BETTY	I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
ROSA	So why'd you come to L.A.?
BETTY	I came for love. My fiancé is here.

BETTY	It's something I had to do. For David.
ROSA	'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?

BETTY	No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
ROSA	Man, that is love.

ROSA	You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
BETTY	No, that's not, I couldn't...
ROSA	Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?

ROSA	I got this apartment with a guy.
BETTY	The one you were telling me about?
ROSA	No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...

BETTY	It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
ROSA	Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
BETTY	Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
ROSA	Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.

BETTY	Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
ROSA	Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
BETTY	The Five?
ROSA	Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
BETTY	Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
ROSA	Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?

ROSA	You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
BETTY	Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'

BETTY	You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
ROSA	What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
BETTY	I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
ROSA	He has a wife?!
BETTY	Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
ROSA	God, that's awful!
BETTY	It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
ROSA	Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
BETTY	No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
ROSA	Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...

ROSA	...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
BETTY	David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
ROSA	Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
BETTY	Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.

ROSA	Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
BETTY	How many men have I talked to?
ROSA	Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
BETTY	You said in L.A., anything goes.
ROSA	I was talking about what you could wear!

ROSA	Guess who I saw today.
BETTY	Who?
ROSA	Doctor David Ravell.
BETTY	What? Where was he?!
ROSA	ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!

ROSA	Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
BETTY	I have no idea what you're talking about.
ROSA	I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
BETTY	Shhh! I heard you the first time.
ROSA	I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
BETTY	If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
ROSA	IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!

BETTY	Why'd you help me in the first place?
ROSA	I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
BETTY	HE IS REAL!!

ROSA	I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
BETTY	Fine.

BETTY	Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
ROSA	This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.

ROSA	So what do you say? Can we be friends?
BETTY	...okay.

BETTY	What are those for?
ROSA	Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
BETTY	Umm...

BETTY	Looking for someone?
ROSA	You never know who you'll see.

ROSA	Were you with him this whole time?
BETTY	Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
ROSA	You still in love?

ROSA	Does he know you think he's real?
BETTY	He is real.
ROSA	Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
BETTY	Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
ROSA	No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
BETTY	To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
ROSA	Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
BETTY	Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
ROSA	I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.

ROSA	This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
BETTY	No, almost never.
ROSA	But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...

BETTY	Are you sure I can borrow this?
ROSA	No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
BETTY	Rosa...
ROSA	Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
BETTY	You should have a little faith in people.
ROSA	Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
BETTY	All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.

BETTY	Rosa, so you've met David?
ROSA	Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
BETTY	Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.

ROSA	What are you doing?
BETTY	I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.

BETTY	...this is your sweater, right?
ROSA	Where are you going?
BETTY	I have to leave now.

ROSA	What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
BETTY	You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
ROSA	Your husband?!
BETTY	Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...

ROSA	What?! That you had something to do with it?
BETTY	I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
ROSA	Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
BETTY	There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
ROSA	Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.

ROSA	These guys are here to help you, Betty.
BETTY	I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.

LONNIE	Blake, I can handle that transplant!
BLAKE	We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
LONNIE	Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
BLAKE	Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
LONNIE	I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
BLAKE	No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...

GEORGE	What can I do for you, gentlemen?
CHARLIE	How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
GEORGE	Deranged. That would be the right word.

GEORGE	That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
CHARLIE	Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
GEORGE	More than you know. Is there anything else?
CHARLIE	No, that should be more than --
GEORGE	Good.

CHARLIE	What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
DUANE	Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.

DUANE	Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it?  They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
CHARLIE	You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
DUANE	Huh?
CHARLIE	Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.

DUANE	The fuck you talking about?
CHARLIE	Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
DUANE	He goin' crazy on us, or what?
CHARLIE	Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
DUANE	Really. And where was that, old man?
CHARLIE	Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...

DEL	...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
CHARLIE	You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...

DEL	If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
CHARLIE	Oh, yes, with the coffee...
DEL	Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.

CHARLIE	I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
DEL	Ahh... my wife's.

DEL	All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
CHARLIE	If we're for real?
DEL	You don't exactly look like drug dealers.

CHARLIE	We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
DEL	Fine. You got five...
CHARLIE	It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
DEL	Are you kidding me? What's to like?

CHARLIE	What do you mean?
DEL	It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.

CHARLIE	Could you give us an example?
DEL	Of what?
CHARLIE	I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
DEL	I don't follow...
CHARLIE	You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
DEL	No...
CHARLIE	I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
DEL	Are we gonna do business here, or not?

DEL	All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
CHARLIE	Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?

CHARLIE	You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
DEL	The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
CHARLIE	Like what?
DEL	Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
CHARLIE	Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
DEL	I... I don't know...
CHARLIE	Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
DEL	My socks?

DEL	Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
CHARLIE	...and put them in your mouth.

CHARLIE	Bourbon, little water, thank you.
WESLEY	Beer, please.

WESLEY	Hey... you got a fine one right here!
CHARLIE	Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?

WESLEY	Relax, we brought the cash.
CHARLIE	I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?

WESLEY	No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
CHARLIE	That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.

WESLEY	That's right.
CHARLIE	Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
WESLEY	That is so right.
CHARLIE	Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
WESLEY	Now, that's really stupid.
CHARLIE	So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?

CHARLIE	You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
WESLEY	Hell of a way to die.
CHARLIE	It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.

CHARLIE	Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
WESLEY	A mark, huh?

CHARLIE	I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
WESLEY	IT SURE IS!!

CHARLIE	Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
WESLEY	You told me how to do it!
CHARLIE	That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?

CHARLIE	This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
WESLEY	He told us it's in the Buick.
CHARLIE	We don't know which Buick, do we?
WESLEY	Well, why'd you shoot him?
CHARLIE	I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.

WESLEY	I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
CHARLIE	I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
WESLEY	I didn't. You gave me a look!
CHARLIE	What 'look'?
WESLEY	That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
CHARLIE	I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
WESLEY	Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
CHARLIE	What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?

CHARLIE	It's not here. Let's go.
WESLEY	You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
CHARLIE	Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
WESLEY	I wanted to make a statement.
CHARLIE	Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
WESLEY	...that's a good motto.
CHARLIE	Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.

CHARLIE	Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
WESLEY	I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.

WESLEY	We can live with that.
CHARLIE	I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.

CHARLIE	Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
WESLEY	Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.

CHARLIE	He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
WESLEY	Should I kill him now?
CHARLIE	Wait. Any last words, General Lee?

CHARLIE	What the hell was that, another statement?
WESLEY	Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
CHARLIE	You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...

WESLEY	So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
CHARLIE	We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?

CHARLIE	Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
WESLEY	I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
CHARLIE	I hope you're right...
WESLEY	...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.

CHARLIE	So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
WESLEY	You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
CHARLIE	Joyce was screwing Del.
WESLEY	...among others.
CHARLIE	I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
WESLEY	Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.

CHARLIE	No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
WESLEY	A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
CHARLIE	You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.

CHARLIE	Betty, Betty, Betty...
WESLEY	So what the fuck's a Finn?
CHARLIE	Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
WESLEY	Like... us?
CHARLIE	No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.

CHARLIE	Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
WESLEY	Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?

WESLEY	Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
CHARLIE	It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
WESLEY	And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
CHARLIE	You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."

WESLEY	Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
CHARLIE	Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!

WESLEY	Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
CHARLIE	...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...

CHARLIE	They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
WESLEY	Half.
CHARLIE	What?
WESLEY	They paid us half. They still owe us half...
CHARLIE	There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!

CHARLIE	That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
WESLEY	I know that.
CHARLIE	AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!

CHARLIE	Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
WESLEY	Worse... you're in Texas.
CHARLIE	Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!

CHARLIE	You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
WESLEY	What the hell's the matter with you?

CHARLIE	That was a really shitty thing to do.
WESLEY	I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.

WESLEY	What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
CHARLIE	I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
WESLEY	I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.

CHARLIE	How'd they describe her?
WESLEY	You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
CHARLIE	Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?

CHARLIE	We should go.
WESLEY	We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
CHARLIE	It's a very moving experience, trust me.
WESLEY	No.
CHARLIE	One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
WESLEY	No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
CHARLIE	What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
WESLEY	I said, 'No.' N-O.

CHARLIE	When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral...  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
WESLEY	Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...

CHARLIE	Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
WESLEY	Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.

WESLEY	Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
CHARLIE	Where? Where is she?
WESLEY	I'm not telling.
CHARLIE	What?
WESLEY	I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.

CHARLIE	This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
WESLEY	Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...

CHARLIE	So you believed the bartender. Why?
WESLEY	Well... I think I saw her soul.
CHARLIE	That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
WESLEY	I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
CHARLIE	No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
WESLEY	Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
CHARLIE	What doesn't?
WESLEY	You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
CHARLIE	I never said that I believed...
WESLEY	No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
CHARLIE	'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
WESLEY	I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
CHARLIE	You need to remember who you're talking to...
WESLEY	I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
CHARLIE	Wesley...
WESLEY	It's beneath her... She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!

CHARLIE	Who's this?
WESLEY	A doctor on the show... why?

WESLEY	What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
CHARLIE	It just didn't fit her profile...
WESLEY	Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
CHARLIE	She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
WESLEY	...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
CHARLIE	...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
WESLEY	I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...

CHARLIE	Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
WESLEY	Man, you have got to get some therapy.
CHARLIE	I said 'got it?'
WESLEY	...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
CHARLIE	You made your point...  I was wrong.

WESLEY	You were right. Del wasn't lying.
CHARLIE	Well, you were right about what that bartender said.

CHARLIE	What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
WESLEY	Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
CHARLIE	We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
WESLEY	...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
CHARLIE	No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
WESLEY	It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
CHARLIE	No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.

CHARLIE	Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
WESLEY	What's wrong with you?

ELIZABETH	This is Betty at twelve.
CHARLIE	Very graceful. Perfect form.
ELIZABETH	Betty was a lovely child.

ELIZABETH	I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
CHARLIE	What do you mean?
ELIZABETH	If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
CHARLIE	Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.

CHARLIE	...and how long did she work here?
DARLENE	Oh, five years, give or take.
CHARLIE	Hmm... you two in high school together?
DARLENE	Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
CHARLIE	But she wanted more out of life, right?
DARLENE	No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
CHARLIE	I see.  May I?
DARLENE	If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
CHARLIE	Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
DARLENE	...who doesn't?

WESLEY	What'd you get her?
DEL	Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...

WESLEY	Isn't that the point?
DEL	Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.

WESLEY	Seems like a nice place.
DEL	It is, if you like idiots...

WESLEY	Really?
DEL	You better believe it.

DEL	Jesus Christ!
WESLEY	He's waiting...
DEL	Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
WESLEY	Injuns?

LYLA	Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
GEORGE	No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
LYLA	Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?

LYLA	Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
GEORGE	I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.

GEORGE	Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
LYLA	Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...

GEORGE	She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
LYLA	I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
GEORGE	She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
LYLA	We know that...
GEORGE	Can I have an evil twin?
LYLA	No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
GEORGE	Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
LYLA	I don't know, George...
GEORGE	I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
LYLA	I'll think about it.
GEORGE	It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
LYLA	I said I'll think about it.
GEORGE	Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
LYLA	Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
GEORGE	Hmm?
LYLA	Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch? Remember?
GEORGE	...yeah.

GEORGE	Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
LYLA	What the hell's going on?
GEORGE	If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --

LYLA	Is there a problem, George?
GEORGE	No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!

LYLA	All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
GEORGE	No! Let me try this!

GEORGE	Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
LYLA	I SAID FORGET IT!

LYLA	This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
GEORGE	I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
LYLA	You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
GEORGE	What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
LYLA	Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
GEORGE	That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?

GEORGE	Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
LYLA	Then do as you're told. Get her back.

WESLEY	...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
GUARD	Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
WESLEY	Yeah? The sport utility?
GUARD	Uh-huh.
WESLEY	Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
GUARD	Better.
WESLEY	Oh fuck...

WESLEY	Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
GUARD	Sure.

JERROLD	And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
WESLEY	Would you say she was ambitious?
JERROLD	Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.

JERROLD	You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
WESLEY	...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
JERROLD	Because it ain't natural, young man.
WESLEY	What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...

JOYCE	You're wastin' your time, Roy.
ROY	Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.

JOYCE	Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
ROY	You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
JOYCE	No... before that.
ROY	Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
JOYCE	Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...

JOYCE	I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
ROY	Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...

JOYCE	What did you say?
ROY	The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
JOYCE	No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
ROY	Yeah. Why, you know him?
JOYCE	Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...

MERCEDES	What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
ROSA	Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
MERCEDES	So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
ROSA	Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
MERCEDES	So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
ROSA	She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
MERCEDES	Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
ROSA	David Ravell.
MERCEDES	God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
ROSA	I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
MERCEDES	Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"

MERCEDES	Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
ROSA	Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.

WESLEY	SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
ROY	I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
WESLEY	Did Chloe crack?
ROY	Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
WESLEY	Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
ROY	She's a lesbian.

WESLEY	You lie, motherfucker...
ROY	I swear to God!

WESLEY	Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
SUE ANN	I wish I could help you, but I can't.

WESLEY	Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
SUE ANN	No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
WESLEY	I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
SUE ANN	No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
WESLEY	Her show?
SUE ANN	A Reason to Love.

WESLEY	I see.  Did Chloe testify?
SUE ANN	I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
WESLEY	Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?

WESLEY	Yeah?
SUE ANN	Mr. Campbell?
WESLEY	Huh?
SUE ANN	Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
WESLEY	Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
SUE ANN	It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.

ANNE	Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
GRAYSON	Yes - Sing Sing.

ANNE	Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
GRAYSON	To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
ANNE	Exactly.
GRAYSON	Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
ANNE	You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.

GRAYSON	Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
ANNE	Dexter.

ANNE	Indeed? How interesting.
GALLAGHER	Yes - isn't it.

ANNE	Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
GALLAGHER	Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
ANNE	Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
GALLAGHER	Goodbye, Stew

GALLAGHER	I think I better go, Stew.
ANNE	I think you should, Miss Gallagher.

ANNE	Don't mind Mother.
STEW	I don't mind her if you don't.

ANNE	I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
STEW	Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.

ANNE	You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
STEW	No? Why not?

STEW	You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
ANNE	Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.

STEW	May I use your telephone?
ANNE	Certainly. Right over there.
STEW	You're all right.

STEW	That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
ANNE	You may go, Smythe.

ANNE	What do you want?
STEW	Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.

ANNE	That's considerate of you.
STEW	Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
ANNE	I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
STEW	Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance

STEW	Just listen to this  Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!
ANNE	Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.

STEW	Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
ANNE	I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.

ANNE	Where did you get those letters?
STEW	I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.

ANNE	I suppose you're going to print them?
STEW	No - give you another guess.

ANNE	Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
STEW	So, it's obvious, huh?

ANNE	Will you step into the library?
STEW	Sure, I'll take a chance.

ANNE	Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
STEW	For what?
ANNE	For the letters, of course.

ANNE	I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
STEW	Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
ANNE	You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
STEW	I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.

ANNE	won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
STEW	Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.

ANNE	Really?
STEW	Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
ANNE	You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
STEW	Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
ANNE	You don't wear garters!

ANNE	I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
STEW	Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
ANNE	Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.

ANNE	Oh, Mother!
STEW	It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
ANNE	Please go. I'll explain to Mother.

ANNE	Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
STEW	How-di-do.

ANNE	Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
STEW	Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
ANNE	None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
STEW	My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
ANNE	That's because you're too far away, Stew.

ANNE	Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
STEW	I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.

STEW	A little? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
ANNE	I'm glad.

STEW	What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
ANNE	You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
STEW	I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.

ANNE	Your place?
STEW	Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
ANNE	Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
STEW	When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?

STEW	We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
ANNE	Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
STEW	Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
ANNE	But we don't need it, I'm sure.
STEW	I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.

STEW	Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
ANNE	Of course I am Stewart.
STEW	Now let's get this settled

ANNE	You have the cutest nose I've
STEW	Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
ANNE	What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
STEW	It isn't cheap. It's nice.
ANNE	Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
STEW	Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
ANNE	Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.

ANNE	I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
STEW	Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!

ANNE	Do you like them?
STEW	Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
ANNE	You wear them of course, silly.
STEW	Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
ANNE	I know that.
STEW	Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
ANNE	Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
STEW	Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!

ANNE	Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
STEW	Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!

ANNE	Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
STEW	Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
ANNE	Oh yes you will wear garters

STEW	Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
ANNE	Gallagher!
STEW	Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.

ANNE	Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
STEW	Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.

ANNE	You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
STEW	Gallagher?

ANNE	Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
STEW	Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
ANNE	Yes - isn't it?

ANNE	No? What do you look upon her as?
STEW	Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.

STEW	That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
ANNE	I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
STEW	You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.

ANNE	Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
STEW	Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.

ANNE	Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
STEW	I poisoned him.
ANNE	Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?

STEW	I'm not going!
ANNE	What are you talking about?
STEW	I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
ANNE	What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
STEW	Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
ANNE	Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
STEW	Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.

STEW	Anne, come here. Listen
ANNE	Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
STEW	I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
ANNE	Are you crazy?
STEW	Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
ANNE	Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
STEW	I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
ANNE	But I don't want to meet your gang.
STEW	I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
ANNE	Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
STEW	Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
ANNE	That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.

STEW	Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
ANNE	Good morning. What does this mean?

STEW	Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
ANNE	I see.
STEW	Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.

STEW	What's the idea, Anne?
ANNE	The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
STEW	Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
ANNE	Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
STEW	Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
ANNE	Your house?
STEW	O-o-oh, I get you  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?

STEW	and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
ANNE	Stewart!
STEW	This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
ANNE	You can't walk out of here like this.

STEW	You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
ANNE	That's ridiculous.
STEW	Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
ANNE	You're acting like a child.
STEW	All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husbandHe has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.

ANNE	You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
MRS. SCHUYLER	I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
ANNE	Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
MRS. SCHUYLER	Oh, shut up!

MRS. SCHUYLER	That's an excellent idea.
ANNE	Oh, hello Mother!

MRS. SCHUYLER	What is this person doing here?
ANNE	Why

MRS. SCHUYLER	It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
ANNE	Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
MRS. SCHUYLER	Sit down!

ANNE	Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
MRS. SCHUYLER	I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
ANNE	Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
MRS. SCHUYLER	Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
ANNE	You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
MRS. SCHUYLER	It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.

MRS. SCHUYLER	Ah-ah-ah!
ANNE	Mother!
MRS. SCHUYLER	Look! Look! The front page!

ANNE	Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
MRS. SCHUYLER	All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!

BINGY	Hello, there, Meadows![13]
SMYTHE	Who is it you wish to see, sir?
BINGY	I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
SMYTHE	Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening
BINGY	Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know

BINGY	a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
SMYTHE	I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
BINGY	Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.

BINGY	What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
GRAYSON	You're the Tribune man?
BINGY	Yeah, hello. How are you?

GRAYSON	Fine. Have a seat.
BINGY	Thanks, I will.

GRAYSON	This way.
BINGY	Oh, man!

GRAYSON	Fine newspaper the Tribune.
BINGY	Well, I should say!
GRAYSON	I knew your managing editor very well.
BINGY	Is that so?
GRAYSON	Yale '21, I believe.
BINGY	Huh?
GRAYSON	We were classmates.

GRAYSON	I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
BINGY	Is that so?
GRAYSON	As one Tribune man to another

BINGY	Yeah!
GRAYSON	But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
BINGY	Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
GRAYSON	I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
BINGY	Oh yeah?

GRAYSON	So, you see how silly that rumor is?
BINGY	Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
GRAYSON	That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.

GRAYSON	Thank you very much.
BINGY	All right, all right, don't mention it.
GRAYSON	Give my regards to your managing editor.
BINGY	I certainly will.

BINGY	Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
STEW	Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
BINGY	Oh, is that so?
STEW	I'm afraid.

STEW	Impossible. Put it on again.
BINGY	Hey, make up your mind, will you?

STEW	What do you want?
BINGY	Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
STEW	Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
BINGY	Oh boy, I'd love it.

STEW	How's that?
BINGY	Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
STEW	Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
BINGY	A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
STEW	Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.

BINGY	I bring a message from Garcia.
STEW	Yeah?
BINGY	Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
STEW	Yeah - go on.
BINGY	It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
STEW	I'll bite. What's the catch?
BINGY	There's no catch. This is on the up and up. Of course all you have to do is just sign the article - by Anne Schuyler's Husband.

STEW	Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
BINGY	No, it's just little Bingy Baker.

BINGY	Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
STEW	Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.

BINGY	Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
STEW	Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
BINGY	I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
STEW	You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.

STEW	Look, I quit!
CONROY	Yeah?
STEW	Yeah.
CONROY	Yeah?
STEW	You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!

CONROY	Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
STEW	With me you can always do business.
CONROY	Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
STEW	It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.

CONROY	Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
STEW	Gloria Golden?
CONROY	Yeah, little Gloria.
STEW	The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
CONROY	Right - for the first time this year.
STEW	Well - it's only April.
CONROY	Come on, get going, get going!
STEW	Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
CONROY	Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
STEW	All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
CONROY	What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
STEW	I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.

STEW	Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
CONROY	Do you call yourself a reporter?

STEW	It has been alleged - yes
CONROY	You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
STEW	Not on my own beat, no.
CONROY	No? Well, where were you when that happened?

CONROY	I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
STEW	No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
CONROY	Why not?
STEW	Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
CONROY	What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
STEW	Yes, sir.
CONROY	Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.

STEW	Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
CONROY	Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!

CONROY	Well, when are you quitting?
STEW	Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.

CONROY	Mr. Schuyler .
STEW	Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
CONROY	Is that so?
STEW	That's so.

CONROY	Just a boid in a gilded cage -
STEW	A what?
CONROY	You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
STEW	Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
CONROY	And live on your salary, I suppose?
STEW	Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
CONROY	What play?
STEW	My play.
CONROY	The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
STEW	Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
CONROY	Araby?
STEW	Sure.
CONROY	Araby, my eye!

CONROY	Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting.
STEW	I'm not quitting!
CONROY	No?
STEW	No!
CONROY	'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha

DAWSON	How do you like your bath, sir?
STEW	I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?

STEW	Who are you?
DAWSON	I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
STEW	You're my what?
DAWSON	Your valet, sir.

STEW	Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
DAWSON	Dawson, sir.
STEW	Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
DAWSON	Drunk, sir?

STEW	Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
DAWSON	Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.

STEW	Did you take anything out of those pants?
DAWSON	Oh no, sir!
STEW	What are you doing fooling around in here?
DAWSON	Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.

STEW	Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
DAWSON	Thank you, sir.
STEW	But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.

STEW	Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
DAWSON	Quite so. Quite.
STEW	Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
DAWSON	Now Mr. Smith, now please

STEW	All right, outside!
DAWSON	I beg your pardon, sir?
STEW	Outside!

DAWSON	I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
STEW	There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!

DAWSON	That's a canary, sir.
STEW	That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
DAWSON	Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
STEW	A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
DAWSON	Yes sir!

GALLAGHER	Yes.
MISS WILSON	I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
GALLAGHER	I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
MISS WILSON	Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
GALLAGHER	Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
MISS WILSON	Yes, of course. I'll get it for you

MISS WILSON	That's a lovely dress.
GALLAGHER	Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
MISS WILSON	Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
GALLAGHER	Yes.
MISS WILSON	He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
GALLAGHER	I bet.
MISS WILSON	You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?

GALLAGHER	Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
STEW	Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!

GALLAGHER	The boss is getting hoarse.
STEW	There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.

GALLAGHER	You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
STEW	I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!

GALLAGHER	You what?
STEW	Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
GALLAGHER	For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
STEW	Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!

STEW	And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it
GALLAGHER	and that
STEW	and those and them.

GALLAGHER	Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
STEW	Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
GALLAGHER	Of course I haven't got a nose.

STEW	Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
GALLAGHER	On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
STEW	Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
GALLAGHER	And the rest of us are truck horses?
STEW	There you go, talking like a woman!
GALLAGHER	Well!
STEW	Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.

STEW	Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
GALLAGHER	I didn't run away.

STEW	Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
GALLAGHER	Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.

STEW	Thanks, thanks.
GALLAGHER	I hope you'll be very happy.

STEW	Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
GALLAGHER	It's the smoke.
STEW	Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
GALLAGHER	Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.

STEW	Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
GALLAGHER	Not since you broke into society.
STEW	Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.

GALLAGHER	Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
STEW	Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
GALLAGHER	Remember, she's a Schuyler.
STEW	Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
GALLAGHER	My error.
STEW	Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
GALLAGHER	Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
STEW	Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?

GALLAGHER	Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
STEW	Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.

GALLAGHER	Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
STEW	Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
GALLAGHER	Sure - I think so, Stew.
STEW	I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
GALLAGHER	How is her family going to feel about it?
STEW	Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?

GALLAGHER	Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
STEW	Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
GALLAGHER	There you are!
STEW	Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
GALLAGHER	I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
STEW	Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
GALLAGHER	Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
STEW	No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
GALLAGHER	Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.

STEW	Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
GALLAGHER	Nothing.
STEW	What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
GALLAGHER	I dyed one and washed the other.
STEW	Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.

GALLAGHER	Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
STEW	Staring at us?
GALLAGHER	My mistake - she's glaring.
STEW	Must be my wife.

GALLAGHER	They all consider me just as one of the boys.
STEW	Right!

STEW	I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
GALLAGHER	Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
STEW	No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
GALLAGHER	Yes.

STEW	Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
GALLAGHER	Hello, Stew.
STEW	Hello, Hank. How are you?

GALLAGHER	I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
STEW	I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
GALLAGHER	Okay.
STEW	Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!

STEW	You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
GALLAGHER	Yes - and I'd love it.

GALLAGHER	How far have you gotten?
STEW	Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.

GALLAGHER	Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
STEW	Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.

GALLAGHER	Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
STEW	Been where?
GALLAGHER	To Old Madrid.
STEW	Never even been to New Madrid.
GALLAGHER	Then how do you expect to write about it?
STEW	Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
GALLAGHER	Did Conrad draw on his imagination?

STEW	Did who?
GALLAGHER	Conrad.
STEW	What do you know about Conrad?
GALLAGHER	I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?

GALLAGHER	Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
STEW	Right.
GALLAGHER	Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
STEW	Right.
GALLAGHER	Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
STEW	Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
GALLAGHER	Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
STEW	And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
GALLAGHER	What could I be?
STEW	You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
GALLAGHER	Here you are.
STEW	All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?

STEW	Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
GALLAGHER	Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
STEW	Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
GALLAGHER	Very good.

GALLAGHER	I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
STEW	Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.

STEW	Hey, Gallagher!
GALLAGHER	Yeah?
STEW	How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
GALLAGHER	It'll be ready in a minute.
STEW	Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
GALLAGHER	Sorry, boss
STEW	Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.

GALLAGHER	Who was that?
STEW	Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
GALLAGHER	What did he want?
STEW	Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.

STEW	It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
GALLAGHER	Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.

GALLAGHER	What other girl?
STEW	The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
GALLAGHER	But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
STEW	Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
GALLAGHER	No.
STEW	There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.

STEW	Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
GRAYSON	Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
STEW	Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
GRAYSON	No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
STEW	Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.

STEW	Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
GRAYSON	We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.

STEW	A statement? Good.
GRAYSON	I have it here.
STEW	Good.

GRAYSON	The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
STEW	Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.

GRAYSON	I think you'd better go.
STEW	Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and

GRAYSON	I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
STEW	You quit trying to stop anybody
GRAYSON	Well, at best you might deny it.
STEW	Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
GRAYSON	Traps shut!
STEW	Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?

GRAYSON	Hello, Smith.
STEW	Holy jumping swordfish!
GRAYSON	I suppose you know why I came?
STEW	No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
GRAYSON	Now don't be absurd, Smith  May I come in?
STEW	Surely, come right in.
GRAYSON	Thanks. May I sit down?
STEW	Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
GRAYSON	I don't eat waffles.
STEW	You don't.

GRAYSON	Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
STEW	She did?
GRAYSON	She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
STEW	Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
GRAYSON	You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.

STEW	Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
GRAYSON	That's putting it crudely, but

STEW	Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
GRAYSON	I beg your pardon.
STEW	Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.

GRAYSON	We just thought that
STEW	Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!

GRAYSON	Yes.
STEW	And now for that twentieth crack

HANK	Fine, but kinda thirsty.
STEW	Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
HANK	Okay - you remember Joe
STEW	Sure.
HANK	I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
STEW	It's all right. Bring him in.

HANK	Come in, Joe. It's all right.
STEW	Hello, Joe.

STEW	I'm sorry nobody could come.
HANK	The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
STEW	Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!

MRS. SCHUYLER	What is it, Smythe?
SMYTHE	Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?

MRS. SCHUYLER	Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
SMYTHE	I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.

MRS. SCHUYLER	Some bicarbonate - quick!
SMYTHE	Double strength!

SMYTHE	Double-strength!
MRS. SCHUYLER	Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!

SMYTHE	Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
MRS. SCHUYLER	Are the cars ready?
SMYTHE	They've been ready for the last half hour.

MRS. SCHUYLER	Smythe, you've been drinking.
SMYTHE	I have. Double-strength!

MRS. SCHUYLER	Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
STEW	Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...

STEW	As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
MRS. SCHUYLER	Why

MRS. SCHUYLER	Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.
STEW	With pleasure, Madame!
MRS. SCHUYLER	Get out of here.

STEW	Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
MRS. SCHUYLER	About what? Your marriage to Anne!
STEW	Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.

MRS. SCHUYLER	Stop calling me Mother!
STEW	All right, Grandma
MRS. SCHUYLER	This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?

STEW	Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
MRS. SCHUYLER	Have you seen this? 
STEW	Yes - the worm!
MRS. SCHUYLER	I beg your pardon?
STEW	He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
MRS. SCHUYLER	To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!

MRS. SCHUYLER	And you struck him right here in our house?
STEW	Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.

STEW	That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
MRS. SCHUYLER	Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?

MRS. SCHUYLER	What's going on here? Who is this woman?
STEW	Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
MRS. SCHUYLER	Heavens! The man's insane!
STEW	Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.

STEW	There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
SMYTHE	I understand, sir.

STEW	Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
SMYTHE	The name is Smythe.
STEW	Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
SMYTHE	Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
STEW	I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.

SMYTHE	But I
STEW	Now the lady said you may go

SMYTHE	Well done, sir. Very neat.
STEW	That's what I think of it, Bingy!

STEW	Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
SMYTHE	Yes, sir.

SMYTHE	Did you call, sir?
STEW	Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?

STEW	Shhh! Do you hear something?
SMYTHE	Yes, sir.
STEW	You try it.
SMYTHE	Me, sir?
STEW	Yeah.

STEW	No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
SMYTHE	No, sir!
STEW	Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
SMYTHE	Yes, sir.
STEW	Found no skeletons?
SMYTHE	No, sir.
STEW	It's haunted just the same.
SMYTHE	Yes, sir.

STEW	Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
SMYTHE	Well, sir, I putter.
STEW	Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
SMYTHE	I just putter.
STEW	Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
SMYTHE	Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
STEW	Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
SMYTHE	Well sir, I'll show you.

SMYTHE	That's puttering, sir.
STEW	No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
SMYTHE	Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
STEW	Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
SMYTHE	Yes sir.
STEW	Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
SMYTHE	Yes sir.
STEW	How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
SMYTHE	You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
STEW	Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
SMYTHE	Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
STEW	A bird in a gilded cage?
SMYTHE	Yes.
STEW	That's all I wanted to know!

STEW	Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
SMYTHE	Very good, sir.

SMYTHE	It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
STEW	Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?

BARRY	This is Barry.
KAREN	Hey it's me, what are you doing?
BARRY	Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
KAREN	Yeah but what are you doing?
BARRY	I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
KAREN	So you can't talk to me?
BARRY	I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
KAREN	chat? Did you just say "chat?"
BARRY	Well, I can't talk though --
KAREN	You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
BARRY	Yes, I'll be there.
KAREN	Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
BARRY	Ok, bye-bye.

KAREN	Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
BARRY	No, no, no.
KAREN	Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?

BARRY	...yes I'm still on hold...
OPERATOR	And what was this?
BARRY	I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
OPERATOR	This is "Fly With Us?"
BARRY	It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
OPERATOR	I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
BARRY	So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
OPERATOR	That's it.
BARRY	Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
OPERATOR	I don't know...I mean: I don't know.

OPERATOR	It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
BARRY	Ok. Thank you.

OPERATOR	What city?
BARRY	Somewhere in Utah.
OPERATOR	What's the listing?
BARRY	D&D Mattress Man.

ELIZABETH	Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
ELIZABETH	I'm just stopping by to say hello.
BARRY	Hello.
ELIZABETH	So you're coming tonight, right?
BARRY	Yes, indeed, yes I am.
ELIZABETH	There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
BARRY	Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
ELIZABETH	Why?
BARRY	Well I don't want to do something like that.
ELIZABETH	She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
BARRY	Yeah, but please don't do that.
ELIZABETH	I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
BARRY	Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
ELIZABETH	It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
BARRY	Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
ELIZABETH	That's your fault not mine.
BARRY	I don't think I'm going to the party.
ELIZABETH	So it's ok if I bring her.
BARRY	Please don't.
ELIZABETH	She's really cute and she's really nice.
BARRY	...please, I just don't want it....
ELIZABETH	....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
BARRY	Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
ELIZABETH	I'm trying to be your friend.
BARRY	I know.
ELIZABETH	I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
BARRY	Well, yeah, thank you, but --
ELIZABETH	-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.

ELIZABETH	Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
BARRY	Hello everyone.

ELIZABETH	You just said very food.
BARRY	Did I say that?

ELIZABETH	You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
BARRY	Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
ELIZABETH	She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
BARRY	No.
ELIZABETH	You look nervous.
BARRY	I'm not, I'm very happy.

ELIZABETH	Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
BARRY	I don't know.

ELIZABETH	This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
BARRY	Yeah I can't.
ELIZABETH	Why?
BARRY	I have work, I can't leave.
ELIZABETH	Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
BARRY	I'm sorry.

ELIZABETH	Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
BARRY	I'm gonna call you back.

ELIZABETH	It's not cool?
BARRY	It's fine, but --
ELIZABETH	-- do you think you'll ask her out?
BARRY	I feel really on the spot now.
ELIZABETH	Are you gonna do it?
BARRY	I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
ELIZABETH	You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
BARRY	I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
ELIZABETH	I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
BARRY	I don't know.
ELIZABETH	I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
BARRY	What?
ELIZABETH	Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
BARRY	I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
ELIZABETH	You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.

BARRY	Yeah I can't.
ELIZABETH	OH MY GOD. Look at that.

ELIZABETH	What's all this pudding?
BARRY	It's not mine.
ELIZABETH	Why's it here?
BARRY	I have no idea.

BARRY	Goodbye.
ELIZABETH	Call me later.

ELIZABETH	Hey. What are you doing?
BARRY	Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?

ELIZABETH	What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
BARRY	....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
ELIZABETH	You're so scared.
BARRY	Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
ELIZABETH	Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
BARRY	......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
ELIZABETH	No she didn't; that's a lie.
BARRY	I....please don't do this.
ELIZABETH	What? Tell me why you wanna know --
BARRY	I just want to know where she's staying.
ELIZABETH	Tell me why.
BARRY	There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
ELIZABETH	-- what are you talking about, come on --
BARRY	-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.

LENA	Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
BARRY	No.
LENA	They're not open yet?
BARRY	They don't get opened until eight.

LENA	Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
BARRY	I don't know.
LENA	I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
BARRY	I don't know.
LENA	Do you know them.
BARRY	Not very well.
LENA	Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
LENA	You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
BARRY	I think that'll be fine.

LENA	There's a piano in the street.
BARRY	Yeah.
LENA	Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
BARRY	Thank you.
LENA	Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
BARRY	Ok.

LENA	Hi.
BARRY	Hi.
LENA	Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
BARRY	Yes I do.

LENA	I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
BARRY	It's fine. It was fun, though.
LENA	It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
BARRY	No. Not at all. It's nice.

LENA	Business is good, you're busy?
BARRY	Yeah, not really.
LENA	I saw a picture of you.
BARRY	Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
BARRY	Do you have brothers or sisters?
LENA	No. I'm the exact opposite --
BARRY	That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
LENA	It's terrible, no.

LENA	What do you do with all this pudding?
BARRY	That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.

LENA	Oh My God.
BARRY	It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?

LENA	Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
BARRY	Are you guys hurt?

BARRY	That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
LENA	Really?
BARRY	I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
LENA	-- well, if you're gonna go --
BARRY	-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
LENA	-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
BARRY	-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.

LENA	It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
BARRY	Ok.

LENA	I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
BARRY	Sure.
LENA	Do you want to pick me up?
BARRY	Sure.
LENA	Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
BARRY	Sure.

BARRY	This is funny.
LENA	Yeah.
BARRY	I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
LENA	Ok.
BARRY	Alright?
LENA	....Hi.....
BARRY	....Hi.....

LENA	Who is it?
BARRY	It's Barry.

BARRY	...really? That's nice...are you lying?
LENA	...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --

BARRY	That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
LENA	Yeah.
BARRY	How long have you known her?
LENA	About six months.
BARRY	You like her?
LENA	Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
BARRY	Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
LENA	No, no. I did.
BARRY	That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
LENA	Yeah.
BARRY	So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
LENA	Yeah?
BARRY	....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
LENA	You were talking about the promotion --
BARRY	-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
LENA	Yeah.
BARRY	That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
LENA	Yeah.
BARRY	You see?
LENA	Yeah, no, I see --
BARRY	You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
LENA	That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
BARRY	....yeah....
LENA	So that was your pudding?
BARRY	....No....
LENA	I'm sorry. I thought you said --
BARRY	No I didn't say that.
LENA	I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
BARRY	My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
LENA	Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?

LENA	Is everything ok?
BARRY	Yes.
LENA	What happened?
BARRY	Nothing.
LENA	What did he want?
BARRY	Nothing.

BARRY	I have a better idea of where we can go.
LENA	Ok.

BARRY	There's a better place for us to eat.
LENA	Did something happen; are you alright?
BARRY	Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.

LENA	Your portable reed organ....the piano.
BARRY	Well, it's fine. Thank you.
LENA	Did you pick it up from the street?
BARRY	What?
LENA	Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
BARRY	...yes I did...?
LENA	Are you learning how to play it?
BARRY	Yes? I'm trying.
LENA	Oh that's great.
LENA	So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
BARRY	Yes no not really.

BARRY	Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
LENA	...yeah...
BARRY	It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
LENA	I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
BARRY	Yeah.
LENA	If you come to Hawaii --
BARRY	Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
LENA	You don't think you'll go --
BARRY	I don't know.
LENA	Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
BARRY	Ok. Have a good trip.

BARRY	This is Barry.
LENA	This is Lena.
BARRY	Hi.
LENA	I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
BARRY	Really?
LENA	Yeah.
BARRY	So what do I do then?

BARRY	That was good.
LENA	Yeah.
BARRY	I'll see you later.
LENA	Ok.
BARRY	I don't freak out very often.
LENA	What do you mean?
BARRY	I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
LENA	...I don't know what you mean....
BARRY	I don't freak out.
LENA	Ok.
BARRY	Have a good trip.
LENA	Thank you.

LENA	Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
BARRY	You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
LENA	No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
LENA	About six months ago. Why?
BARRY	I just wanted to make sure.
LENA	When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
BARRY	Where you married?
LENA	yeah.
BARRY	Ok. So you were married for how long?
LENA	Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
BARRY	Ok. Where are you from originally?

LENA	You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
BARRY	Yeah......yeah.....

BARRY	This really looks like Hawaii here.

BARRY	Do you wanna have sex?
LENA	Yeah.

LENA	Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.

LENA	I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
BARRY	I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
LENA	...what...?
BARRY	IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.

LENA	I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
BARRY	This is funny.
LENA	Yeah.
BARRY	This is nice.

LENA	Where do you have to go?
BARRY	For what?
LENA	For work.....
BARRY	I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.

BARRY	How many times have you been on an airplane?
LENA	I think maybe over a hundred.
BARRY	That's right you travel so much.
LENA	Yeah.

BARRY	I forgot about that.
LENA	Can I come home with you when we get there?

BARRY	Are you ok?
LENA	I'm fine are you ok?
BARRY	Yes I'm sorry.
LENA	What is this?
BARRY	Let's go to the hospital.

BARRY	Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
LENA	You left me at the hospital.
BARRY	I'm sorry.
LENA	You can't do that.
BARRY	Ok.
BARRY	If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......

BARRY	Alright, alright.

DAVID	Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
BARRY	You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....

BARRY	They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
CHECK OUT GIRL	What is this, man?
BARRY	I'm sorry.
CHECK OUT GIRL	Are you serious with this?
BARRY	Yes. Sorry.
CHECK OUT GIRL	Well....what do you want, then?
BARRY	Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
CHECK OUT GIRL	This is a bunch of bullshit.
BARRY	I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....

BARRY	This is Barry.

KATHLEEN	Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
BARRY	Yes, yes, right.

DAVID	That's cool.
DEAN	When can you leave?
DAVID	As soon as you want.
DEAN	I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.

DEAN	Your expenses are your own.
DAVID	I thought Latisha said you would --
DEAN	-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
DAVID	It's....whatever....that's not cool.
DEAN	David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.

DEAN	This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
DAVID	Ok.
DEAN	That's it.
DAVID	Can we maybe ask for more money on this?

LATISHA	So they'll go.
DEAN	I'm only paying two of you guys.

DEAN	...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
LATISHA	Uch. Shut up, Dean.
DEAN	What's the problem?
LATISHA	You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --

DEAN	Hello?
LATISHA	Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
DEAN	What did you say?
LATISHA	Nothing.
DEAN	Put him through.
LATISHA	No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
DEAN	Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --

ELIZABETH	He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
LENA	It's fine.

LENA	It's ok. That's alright.
ELIZABETH	Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?

LENA	I'll go pay for my car.
ELIZABETH	Are you sure?
LENA	Yeah.
ELIZABETH	He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
LENA	It's not bad, it's ok.
ELIZABETH	-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
LENA	It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
ELIZABETH	Sorry.

LENA	We should be going --
ELIZABETH	Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.

ELIZABETH	I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
LENA	You ready?
ELIZABETH	Are you coming to eat with us?

LENA	Are you ready?
ELIZABETH	Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
LENA	Bye, Barry.

ELIZABETH	So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
LENA	Ok.

ELIZABETH	They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
LENA	Ok. What should I do about Eric?
ELIZABETH	Just tell him to call me.
LENA	Ok.
ELIZABETH	So...did my brother call you?
LENA	No.
ELIZABETH	I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
LENA	It's fine.
ELIZABETH	You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
LENA	He did seem a little strange.
ELIZABETH	Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
LENA	I'm sorry. You're right.
ELIZABETH	I think he's weird, but that's me.
LENA	Should I call you later?
ELIZABETH	I'll just see you when you get back here.
LENA	Ok.

BIRDIE	I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
CHIP	Is MOM... in there?
BIRDIE	No!  It wasn't like gore movies at all!  IT WAS REAL!

CHIP	Bring her home... I guess.
BIRDIE	No more violence... No more violence...

CHIP	I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
MISTY	Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.

CHIP	Here we go again.
MISTY	He's really cute!

MISTY	Hi!
CHIP	Jeeezzz!

CHIP	 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
MISTY	You said you hated him.
CHIP	Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!

MISTY	 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
CHIP	MURDERED?!!
MISTY	Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
CHIP	It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!

CHIP	How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
MISTY	No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.

CHIP	DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
MISTY	I DO! Mom's gone crazy!

MISTY	Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
CHIP	If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?

DAD	Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
CHIP	Always the dentist.

CHIP	You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
DAD	I certainly did not.

DAD	Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
CHIP	Aw, Mom! I hate Mr. Stubbins!

DAD	I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
CHIP	Is there a killer loose?

CHIP	Carl's a jerk!
DAD	He certainly drives like a jerk.

DAD	No comment!
CHIP	Serial Mom?  WOW!

CHIP	Sorry, ma'am.
MRS. JENSON	Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
CHIP	Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
MRS. JENSON	There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
CHIP	Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
MRS. JENSON	Why?
CHIP	Because it's the rules!
MRS. JENSON	I don't feel like rewinding it!

CHIP	You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
MRS. JENSON	Keep the change, you son of a psycho!

MOM	Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
CHIP	She sure can pick 'em!

MOM	Chip, honey?
CHIP	Thanks, Mom.

MOM	Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
CHIP	Let me see!

MOM	You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
CHIP	But Mom, the video's not over.
MOM	No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 

MOM	Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
CHIP	Oh Mom...
MOM	Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?

MOM	Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
CHIP	Looks good, Mom!

MOM	I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
CHIP	I'm so happy I could shit.
MOM	CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!

MOM	CHIP!!
CHIP	God, Mom!  What's the matter?
MOM	Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
CHIP	You scared me.

CHIP	Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
MOM	Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.

CHIP	In here, Mom...
MOM	But, Chip...

CHIP	Get in, Mom! I have to open.
MOM	This is so silly. 

YOUNG MAN	Are you Chip Sutphin?
CHIP	Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
YOUNG MAN	Your mom killed my brother!

CHIP	That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
YOUNG MAN	That's right.
CHIP	I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
YOUNG MAN	You mean for TV or print?
CHIP	TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
YOUNG MAN	Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?

DAD	Detectives, what is this about?
DET. MOORE	I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
DAD	Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!

DAD	What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
DET. MOORE	Dr. Sutphin is your wife a big reader?
DAD	Bird books mostly...

DAD	We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
DET. MOORE	Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....

MISTY	He goes to college with me!
DAD	Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.

MISTY	You've been working in that video shop too long.
DAD	And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.

MISTY	Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
DAD	Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.

MISTY	I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
DAD	Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.

MISTY	She's gonna kill Scotty!
DAD	BOTH OF YOU! GET IN THE CAR!

DAD	Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
MISTY	I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!

MISTY	Hi, Hank.
DAD	MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!

DAD	Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
MOM	That's nice.
DAD	Nice?! He should have been executed!

DAD	Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
MOM	Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
DAD	No woman would!
MOM	Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!

MOM	Chip, your ride is here.
DAD	Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 

DAD	Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
MOM	Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 

DAD	I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
MOM	I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.

DAD	Goodnight, honey.
MOM	Don't I get a kiss?
DAD	I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
MOM	We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
DAD	It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
MOM	We can be real quiet...
DAD	I love that you're my wife.
MOM	You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
DAD	You bring me such peace...
MOM	Oohhhh, Eugene!
DAD	Shhhh..
MOM	Oooohhhh.
DAD	Don't wake the kids...
MOM	Ooohhhh!

MOM	Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
DAD	You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!

MOM	Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
DAD	Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
MOM	Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!

MOM	There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
DAD	Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.

DAD	I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
MOM	It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 

DAD	Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
MOM	Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!

DAD	Beverly! Not the Sterners!
MOM	It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.

DAD	Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
MOM	Oh, honey!

MOM	Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
DET. BRADFORD	Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
MOM	I know Dottie!

DET. BRADFORD	Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
MOM	What a mess.

DET. BRADFORD	Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
MOM	Yes, I did.

DET. BRADFORD	P as in...
MOM	...People who don't mind their own business.

MOM	Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
DET. BRADFORD	GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!

MR. NAZLEROD	Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
DOTTIE	I certainly did.
MR. NAZLEROD	Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
DOTTIE	Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
MR. NAZLEROD	Who's voice was it, Dottie?
DOTTIE	It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!

MR. NAZLEROD	Objection! Argumentative!
DOTTIE	NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!

DOTTIE	Hello.
MOM	Is this the Cocksucker residence?
DOTTIE	Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
MOM	Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
DOTTIE	You bitch!
MOM	Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
DOTTIE	The police are tracing your call right this minute.
MOM	Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
DOTTIE	FUCK YOU! 

DOTTIE	FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
MOM	I beg your pardon?
DOTTIE	Who is this?
MOM	Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
DOTTIE	Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!

MOM	What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
DOTTIE	I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.

MOM	I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
DOTTIE	Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
MOM	Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
DOTTIE	GODDAMN YOU!

DOTTIE	MOTHERFUCKER!!
MOM	COCKSUCKER! 

MOM	Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
DOTTIE	It's not fair!!
MOM	Are those pussy-willows?

DOTTIE	What did you just say?
MOM	PUSSY-willows, Dottie!

MOM	Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
DOTTIE	I didn't do it!

MOM	And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
DOTTIE	But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!

MOM	Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
DOTTIE	No, I don't.
MOM	So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
DOTTIE	I certainly was not!
MOM	You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
DOTTIE	One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".

MOM	So you do drink?
DOTTIE	Socially... I'll have a beer.
MOM	So you admit you just lied?

DOTTIE	Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
MOM	Let the record show I'm just standing here.
DOTTIE	FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!

MOM	Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
DOTTIE	NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!

MR. NAZLEROD	State your name, please.
MARVIN	Marvin A. Pickles.
MR. NAZLEROD	Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
MARVIN	Yes, I was.

MR. NAZLEROD	Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
MARVIN	I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
MR. NAZLEROD	What do you mean, you're not sure?!

MARVIN	Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
MR. NAZLEROD	You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.

MOM	Who wants fruit salad?
MISTY	I do, please.
MOM	That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
MISTY	It's sugarless.
MOM	You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
MISTY	Sorry, Mom. Thanks.  Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.

MOM	And who may I ask is Carl?
MISTY	Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.

MISTY	He killed people, Mom.
MOM	We all have bad nights. 

MISTY	Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
MOM	Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.

MISTY	I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
MOM	Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 

MISTY	It's him!
MOM	No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.

MOM	Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
MISTY	Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?

MOM	It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
MISTY	Watch the booth! I'll be back! 

MOM	0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
MISTY	Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
MOM	You got your wish.
MISTY	But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!

MRS. ACKERMAN	Beverly, are you alright?
MOM	Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
MRS. ACKERMAN	It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.

MOM	Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
MRS. ACKERMAN	Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
MOM	Who on earth would want to harass poor Dottie Hinkle?

MRS. ACKERMAN	That's like your car, Beverly,
MOM	I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.

MOM	Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
MRS. ACKERMAN	I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
MOM	You want me to keep that under the table for you?
MRS. ACKERMAN	If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.

MRS. ACKERMAN	Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
MOM	Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.

MOM	Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
MRS. ACKERMAN	...Browsing.
MOM	Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
MRS. ACKERMAN	I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
MOM	Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
MRS. ACKERMAN	NO! I could never hurt anyone!

MOM	That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
MRS. ACKERMAN	Yes, but I lent it...
MOM	And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
MRS. ACKERMAN	Yes... but... I didn't...
MOM	Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
MRS. ACKERMAN	No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...

MR. STUBBINS	Mrs... Sutphin?
MOM	Right here!

MR. STUBBINS	Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
MOM	Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
MR. STUBBINS	Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
MOM	Bon Appetit!

MR. STUBBINS	Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
MOM	He's a good boy.
MR. STUBBINS	There is one big problem though.

MOM	What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
MR. STUBBINS	His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
MOM	He is assistant manager of a video shop...
MR. STUBBINS	That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
MOM	Certainly not!
MR. STUBBINS	Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
MOM	No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
MR. STUBBINS	Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.

MOM	I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
SCOTTY	Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.

SCOTTY	Man, that one made me puke!
MOM	You forgot something...
SCOTTY	Are we leaving?
MOM	Yes you are.

SCOTTY	SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
MOM	From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.

MOM	Murder, honey.
SCOTTY	Now, here's a babe!

MRS. STERNER	What was that?
MR. STERNER	I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
MRS. STERNER	Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
MR. STERNER	What's he know?
MRS. STERNER	How to send a bill!!

MR. STERNER	What is it, Betty?
MRS. STERNER	We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!

MRS. ACKERMAN	Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
VENDOR	Yes, ma'am, it is.
MRS. ACKERMAN	I'll give you fifty cents.
VENDOR	That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
MRS. ACKERMAN	Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 

MRS. ACKERMAN	I'll take this instead.
VENDOR	Nice one, huh? Winter's coming.  Three dollars?... I guess that's what I marked it...

JACK	Bill, you're Chief of police now. 
JACK	Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
BILL	You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.

BILL	Shit.
JACK	Bill, we need to talk!
BILL	'Mornin', Jack.

JACK	Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
BILL	Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
JACK	Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.

JACK	How are you going to find him?
BILL	Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.

JACK	That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
BILL	Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?

BILL	What?
JACK	Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
BILL	And that makes you look like a squid?
JACK	I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!

BILL	Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
STARLA	That's not funny.
BILL	Sorry.
STARLA	Whatcha' doin'?
BILL	Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.

BILL	What you up to?
STARLA	Just checking out the lights.

BILL	Pretty, ain't they?
STARLA	I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
BILL	Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.

BILL	There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
STARLA	Oh, yeah?
BILL	Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
STARLA	I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.

STARLA	Grant, where'd you go?
BILL	Hey, Grant.

BILL	Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
STARLA	No. What
BILL	She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.

STARLA	How about Brenda?
BILL	New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.

STARLA	Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
BILL	Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.

STARLA	Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
BILL	He tried to kill you, Starla.
STARLA	He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --

STARLA	Please, Bill. What happened, it's my fault, I know it.
BILL	Starla, it ain't --
STARLA	It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.

BILL	No reception out here.
STARLA	Bill, I'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.

BILL	Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
STARLA	I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?

STARLA	Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
BILL	Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.

STARLA	My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
BILL	When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
STARLA	That wasn't a good night, no.
BILL	I'm sorry.

STARLA	After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
BILL	Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.

BILL	What are you doing?!
STARLA	We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
BILL	What?
STARLA	He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
BILL	No, Starla! No!

STARLA	We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
BILL	Yeah. Good.

BILL	I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
STARLA	Aspirin.

BILL	We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
STARLA	Okay.

BILL	Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
STARLA	You took Bill.
BILL	It's my nature.
STARLA	And this is mine.

TREVOR	What's she see in that douchebag?
BILL	That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.

BILL	He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
TREVOR	Think we should get up a search party, head in there?

BILL	And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
TREVOR	I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?

BILL	Where are you?!
TREVOR	We're coming your way, man!

TREVOR	He's a fucking Martian?!
BILL	A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.

TREVOR	When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
BILL	Shelby!

TREVOR	What the hell are we going to do?!
BILL	Just block the doors, any way you can.

WALLY	Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
BILL	Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...

WALLY	What?
BILL	Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.

WALLY	Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
BILL	The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.

BILL	Rorschach.
WALLY	What do you see? I see a butterfly.

WALLY	Looks like a chipmunk.
BILL	Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.

BILL	I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
WALLY	What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?

SHELBY	You dig that rat out of the hole?
BILL	Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
SHELBY	Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
BILL	Shelby --
SHELBY	Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
BILL	Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?

BILL	Are you nodding?
SHELBY	Yeah.
BILL	I can't hear when you're nodding.
SHELBY	Sorry.
BILL	We'll be there in ten minutes.

BILL	Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
SHELBY	I got to leave my post.
BILL	Do it.

SHELBY	Hey there, Chief.
BILL	Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
SHELBY	Don't worry, Chief.

BRENDA	Megan Halesy' little sister.
GRANT	Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --

BRENDA	My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
GRANT	Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
BRENDA	Hell, I was game!

GRANT	Who's the lucky fella?
BRENDA	Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
GRANT	Already ain't. Married a gal named --
BRENDA	Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.

GRANT	You're lookin' awful pretty.
BRENDA	Shut up.

GRANT	Where's the old half--Mexican?
BRENDA	Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.

GRANT	Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
BRENDA	What?
GRANT	Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.

BRENDA	Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
GRANT	Brought you munchies.

GRANT	Meat.
BUTCHER	Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?

GRANT	Sure thing, killer.
BUTCHER	What can I do you for?
GRANT	Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
BUTCHER	How many you need?

GRANT	Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
BUTCHER	All the rib eyes?
GRANT	Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...

STARLA	He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
GRANT	Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
STARLA	It's just a work thing.
GRANT	Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.

STARLA	Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
STARLA	I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
GRANT	Sure you do.

GRANT	Flip.
STARLA	That's disrespectful.

STARLA	Where are you going?
GRANT	I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
STARLA	That's not true -- Where are you--?
GRANT	Out.

STARLA	I never danced in a towel before.
GRANT	Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.

GRANT	Welcome home.
STARLA	Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?

GRANT	Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
STARLA	My present?
GRANT	You're my princess, aren't you?
STARLA	Okay.
GRANT	I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.

STARLA	What are you doing?
GRANT	You're pretty.

GRANT	Who's that?
STARLA	It's just one of my students, Grant.

STARLA	Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
GRANT	Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.

STARLA	I'll get if for you.
GRANT	No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.

GRANT	Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
STARLA	Grant, no!
GRANT	I loved you. I loved --
STARLA	Grant, you're sick!

KYLIE	But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
STARLA	What other stuff?

KYLIE	Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
STARLA	Through a wound on his stomach?

KYLIE	He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
STARLA	And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
KYLIE	When one sees you they all see you.
STARLA	An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.

MARGARET	Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
TREVOR	Gold--digger, huh?

MARGARET	So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
TREVOR	Hey, look!

TREVOR	Where'd he go?
MARGARET	We ain't never gonna find that girl now.

MARGARET	Praise Jesus.
TREVOR	'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.

MARGARET	Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
TREVOR	Margaret.

CLAYTON	Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
BANDIT	Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
CLAYTON	You.
BANDIT	Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
CLAYTON	You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
BANDIT	Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.

CLAYTON	Get your hands off my daughter!
BANDIT	Your what?

KYLE	Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
BANDIT	Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.

KYLE	What's he get if he wins here?
BANDIT	If...?

KYLE	I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
BANDIT	America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
KYLE	You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.

BANDIT	You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
KYLE	What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
BANDIT	I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.

KYLE	I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
BANDIT	You know how rumors start.

KYLE	Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
BANDIT	Last year, this was a new rig.
KYLE	But it wasn't a Kenworth.

KYLE	I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
BANDIT	How much style?
KYLE	Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
BANDIT	You paying for the gas?

KYLE	You got my barley pop?
BANDIT	What do you think?

KATE	Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
BANDIT	All sound reasons for matrimony.
KATE	Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
BANDIT	Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.

KATE	Kate McConnell.
BANDIT	Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.

KATE	Why're you driving so fast?
BANDIT	I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
KATE	Why? You have a bowling date?
BANDIT	Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
KATE	Who'd want to?
BANDIT	I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
KATE	Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
BANDIT	For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
KATE	A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
BANDIT	It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
KATE	But you could get killed, right?
BANDIT	Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
KATE	An existentialist.
BANDIT	A what?
KATE	Eyes on the road.

KATE	So tell me about yourself.
BANDIT	Okay.

KATE	Well?...
BANDIT	Whaddya want to know? My sign?
KATE	No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
BANDIT	Having fun.
KATE	Is this fun?
BANDIT	Driving?
KATE	Driving, talking to me...
BANDIT	They're both a challenge.
KATE	You have a great profile.
BANDIT	Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.

KATE	Where you from?
BANDIT	Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
KATE	Seriously?!?
BANDIT	Would I lie to you?

KATE	Guess what?
BANDIT	I give up.
KATE	You just passed your nemesis.

KATE	What the hell's going on?
BANDIT	I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.

BANDIT	Anything?
KATE	We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.

KATE	Can I ask you something?
BANDIT	Shoot.
KATE	What do you want to be when you grow up?

KATE	You know, you're not a bad driver.
BANDIT	You know, you're not a bad passenger.

BANDIT	That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
KATE	I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
BANDIT	A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.

KATE	You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
BANDIT	Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.

BANDIT	Well?
KATE	We lost him.

BANDIT	Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
KATE	I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.

BANDIT	Christ, what channel are we on?...
KATE	Eleven.

BANDIT	The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
KATE	Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
BANDIT	Hey...
KATE	Enjoy your Kenworth.

KATE	Jesus!!!
BANDIT	Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.

BANDIT	See ya, Kate.
KATE	Ciao.

BANDIT	What the hell are you doing?!?
KATE	He's after us again!

BANDIT	You know this guy, don't you?
KATE	I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
BANDIT	By stealing my car?
KATE	I would've come back for you.
BANDIT	Yeah.
KATE	Yeah.

KATE	Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
BANDIT	You could've asked.
KATE	You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.

BANDIT	Where did you learn how to drive like this?
KATE	Like what?

BANDIT	Mississippi's the other way!
KATE	You want to lose this putz or not?!?

KATE	-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
BANDIT	Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
KATE	Uh-oh.

BANDIT	Let's hit it.
KATE	Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.

KATE	You plan on driving trucks all your life?
BANDIT	No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.

BANDIT	-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
KATE	Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
BANDIT	I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
KATE	You plan on driving trucks all your life?
BANDIT	I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
KATE	Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?

BANDIT	An unmarked police car.
KATE	How do you know?
BANDIT	I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.

BANDIT	I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
KATE	You take the front, I'll take the back.

BANDIT	I'm proud of you.
KATE	Yeah?
BANDIT	You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.

BANDIT	Kate...
KATE	Ummm?
BANDIT	I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
KATE	Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.

KATE	-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
BANDIT	And?
KATE	He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.

KATE	My very words.
BANDIT	Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.

KATE	They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
BANDIT	Bandit II?

KATE	-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
BANDIT	It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
KATE	What kind of a guy is he?
BANDIT	The minute you see him, you'll know.

KATE	What are you gonna do when you get home?
BANDIT	Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?

KATE	Why are you stopping?
BANDIT	Weight Station.

KATE	One to five?
BANDIT	Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.

BANDIT	Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
KATE	Well, thanks for the lift.
BANDIT	Hey...

BANDIT	What can I say?
KATE	Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.

KATE	He's just exhausted.
BANDIT	That man is your father?!?

KATE	I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
BANDIT	Absolutely.
KATE	Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.

KATE	What are you thinking?
BANDIT	You gotta admire the man's determination.

KATE	See ya, Bandit.
BANDIT	See ya, Kate.

HOT PANTS	Why should I?
BANDIT	Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.

HOT PANTS	I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
BANDIT	Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?

BANDIT	What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
HOT PANTS	Yes.
BANDIT	I'm begging.
HOT PANTS	I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
BANDIT	But you'll do it?
HOT PANTS	I'll do it.
BANDIT	I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
HOT PANTS	You sure do.

WAITRESS	What's your pleasure?
BANDIT	Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
WAITRESS	No what?
BANDIT	Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.

WAITRESS	Order up!
BANDIT	That's me.

WAITRESS	Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
BANDIT	Another time.

BANDIT	Cledus.
CLEDUS	No.
BANDIT	Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.

CLEDUS	Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
BANDIT	How'd you know?

CLEDUS	Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
BANDIT	Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
CLEDUS	That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
BANDIT	No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
CLEDUS	Or in the slammer.
BANDIT	Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
CLEDUS	Waynette!

CLEDUS	Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
BANDIT	Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.

CLEDUS	You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
BANDIT	Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
CLEDUS	No.
BANDIT	See.
CLEDUS	Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
BANDIT	And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.

BANDIT	How long's this gonna take?
CLEDUS	I don't know, man. Ask him?
BANDIT	We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
CLEDUS	If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
BANDIT	Also boring.
CLEDUS	But I still don't think...

CLEDUS	What are you doin' now?
BANDIT	Running blocker.

CLEDUS	All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
BANDIT	Go.
CLEDUS	Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
BANDIT	Six. Got it.
CLEDUS	If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
BANDIT	Twenty-one is nineteen.
CLEDUS	If I say go to two, it's really one.
BANDIT	Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.

CLEDUS	You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
BANDIT	I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
CLEDUS	Bandit?
BANDIT	Yeah?
CLEDUS	Why are we doing this?
BANDIT	Because they said it couldn't be done.

CLEDUS	Loud and clear.
BANDIT	Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.

CLEDUS	He's history.
BANDIT	Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.

BANDIT	Shit! No one's here.
CLEDUS	That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
BANDIT	Let's keep it that way.

CLEDUS	Liquid gold.
BANDIT	Redneck heaven.

CLEDUS	You know how to drive one of these things?
BANDIT	Can a pig whistle?

CLEDUS	Hit the brakes!
BANDIT	They're jammed!

BANDIT	Let's get the hell outta here.
CLEDUS	Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
BANDIT	Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.

BANDIT	We still on schedule?
CLEDUS	Forty-two minutes ahead.

BANDIT	I hate to say I told you so.
CLEDUS	Save it. We got a long haul.
BANDIT	Clear and rolling.

CLEDUS	Bandit I, do you copy?
BANDIT	This is Bandit I, come back.

BANDIT	You can't swear on these.
CLEDUS	What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
BANDIT	Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.

CLEDUS	This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
BANDIT	On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
CLEDUS	Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
BANDIT	What's your twenty?
CLEDUS	I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
BANDIT	Not for long, you ain't.

CLEDUS	What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
BANDIT	If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.

CLEDUS	I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
BANDIT	What does the old Timex say?
CLEDUS	She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
BANDIT	I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.

CLEDUS	Bandit?
BANDIT	Yeah, guy?
CLEDUS	Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 

CLEDUS	My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
BANDIT	On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
CLEDUS	Do I have a choice?
BANDIT	What's your twenty?
CLEDUS	'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.

BANDIT	I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
CLEDUS	What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
BANDIT	As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
CLEDUS	If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.

BANDIT	-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
CLEDUS	I'm at marker eight-five.
BANDIT	Son-of-a-gun. Me too.

CLEDUS	I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
BANDIT	I ran into complications.
CLEDUS	I hate to say it...
BANDIT	Then don't.
CLEDUS	-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
BANDIT	Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
CLEDUS	Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
BANDIT	We're gone.
CLEDUS	Bandit?

BANDIT	Never mind. It's nothing.
CLEDUS	Anything else you don't want me to know?
BANDIT	Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.

BANDIT	Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
CLEDUS	Now what?
BANDIT	We're outta motion lotion.
CLEDUS	I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.

BANDIT	-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
CLEDUS	I'll believe it when I see it.

CLEDUS	I'm all ears, good buddy.
BANDIT	You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
CLEDUS	It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
BANDIT	We'll be waiting. Over.

CLEDUS	Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
BANDIT	You okay?
CLEDUS	Just fine. What's the weather like?
BANDIT	God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
CLEDUS	Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?

BANDIT	-- How we doing?
CLEDUS	It's gonna be close. Real close.

CLEDUS	Talk to me.
BANDIT	We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
CLEDUS	Let's boogie.

CLEDUS	I'm all ears.
BANDIT	You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.

BANDIT	Bandit II?
CLEDUS	I'm here.
BANDIT	You're coming up to the scale house.
CLEDUS	I'm cucumber cool.

CLEDUS	Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
BANDIT	What's that, pardner?
CLEDUS	Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.

BANDIT	How's the clock, Bandit II.
CLEDUS	Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.

CLEDUS	Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
BANDIT	Yeah, but...
CLEDUS	When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
BANDIT	But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
CLEDUS	Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.

VOICE	Breaker. Breaker.
BANDIT	Go breaker.
VOICE	Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
BANDIT	Go head on, breaker.
VOICE	I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
BANDIT	What's your twenty and what's your handle?
VOICE	My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.

VOICE	My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
BANDIT	Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.

VOICE	Breaker. Breaker.
BANDIT	Pick it up, Breaker.
VOICE	Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
BANDIT	What's up, Dixie Chicken?

BANDIT	Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
VOICE	Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
BANDIT	What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?

DICKEY	It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
BANDIT	See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.

DICKEY	I think you're just yellow.
BANDIT	Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.

DICKEY	Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
BANDIT	Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
DICKEY	He's thirsty.

DICKEY	Have any trouble getting here?
BANDIT	About one to five years worth.

CLEDUS	Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
OWNER	You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
CLEDUS	Uh-uh. What Cobra?
OWNER	Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
CLEDUS	Oh, yeah. Good for him.
OWNER	I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.

CLEDUS	Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
KATE	Believe me, that won't be a problem.

KATE	This is Bandit I. Over.
CLEDUS	Where the hell are you?
KATE	Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...

CLEDUS	Shut up, Fred.
KATE	Who's Fred?

KATE	Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
CLEDUS	I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.

KATE	Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
CLEDUS	That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
KATE	What's he...

KATE	I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
CLEDUS	Yes, ma'am.
KATE	How's your twenty?

KATE	Bandit two, you read me?
CLEDUS	You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.

DICKEY	Is that Bandit in the lead?
KYLE	If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
DICKEY	I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
KYLE	Then it must be a helluva idea.

DICKEY	Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
KYLE	Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.

DICKEY	But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
KYLE	That's the point, Dickey.
DICKEY	Oh.
KYLE	Now, you just find him, son.
DICKEY	Yes, sir.

DICKEY	Five thou.
KYLE	Chickenshit money.

KYLE	That crazy sumbitch made it.
DICKEY	Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.

VOICE ONE	-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
VOICE TWO	-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
VOICE ONE	-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
VOICE TWO	-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
VOICE ONE	-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.

VOICE ONE	-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
VOICE TWO	-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
VOICE ONE	-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
VOICE TWO	-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.

SPOCK	I do not understand the final question...
AMANDA	You are half human. The Computer knows that.
SPOCK	The question is irrelevant.
AMANDA	Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
SPOCK	As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
AMANDA	Where must you go?
SPOCK	To Earth. To offer testimony.
AMANDA	You do this -- for friendship?
SPOCK	I do this because I was there,
AMANDA	Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
SPOCK	I would accept that as an axiom.
AMANDA	Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
SPOCK	Humans make illogical decisions...
AMANDA	... They do, indeed.

BOB	Heard there was some excitement.
GILLIAN	Just a couple of kooks...

BOB	How're you doing?
GILLIAN	Fine. Just fine.
BOB	Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
GILLIAN	Bob... it's tearing me apart.
BOB	I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
GILLIAN	Yeah.
BOB	And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
GILLIAN	I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.

GILLIAN	Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
BOB	Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
GILLIAN	Why don't I?

GILLIAN	You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
BOB	Gillian --

NICHOLS	Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
BONES	I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.

NICHOLS	Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
BONES	Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
NICHOLS	Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?

BONES	He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
NICHOLS	Please...

NICHOLS	No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
BONES	A moment alone, please.

BONES	You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
KIRK	We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
BONES	I just wish we could cloak the stench.

BONES	You sure this is such a bright idea?
KIRK	What do you mean?
BONES	I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
KIRK	It'll come back to him.
BONES	Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
KIRK	Mr. Sulu... Take us home...

KIRK	Bones --
BONES	Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!

KIRK	Bones, stay here.
BONES	No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!

BONES	Now wait just a damn minute.
KIRK	Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.

BONES	You're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
KIRK	We've done it before.
BONES	Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
KIRK	Would you prefer to do nothing?

BONES	I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
KIRK	-- That's the general idea.
BONES	That's crazy!
KIRK	If you have a better idea - now's the time.

BONES	It doesn't look all that different.
KIRK	Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.

BONES	Oh, joy.
KIRK	Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.

BONES	Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
KIRK	What do you think, Spock?

KIRK	What did you say she was getting?
BONES	Cramps.

KIRK	An experimental device, doctor.
BONES	Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...

BONES	Wake up, man, wake up!
KIRK	Come on, Pavel...

BONES	He's coming 'round, Jim...
KIRK	Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...

BONES	Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
KIRK	Not me, Bones... They did it.

BONES	Hi... Busy?
SPOCK	Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
BONES	Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
SPOCK	... My shoes...
BONES	Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
SPOCK	I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
BONES	Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
SPOCK	It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
BONES	You're joking...!
SPOCK	A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
BONES	You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
SPOCK	Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.

SPOCK	Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
BONES	Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
SPOCK	There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
BONES	I liked him better before he died.

SPOCK	Specifically, Humpback Whales.
BONES	That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?

SPOCK	10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
BONES	... My God...

BONES	You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
SPOCK	That is what I said, Doctor.
BONES	Then how.?

BONES	Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
SPOCK	Hamlet, Act I scene 4.

BONES	You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
SPOCK	Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
BONES	Naturally.  So what is your problem?
SPOCK	Acceleration is no longer a constant.
BONES	Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
SPOCK	... Best shot...?
BONES	Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
SPOCK	Guessing is not in my nature...
BONES	Well nobody's perfect...

SPOCK	... I don't think he understands...
BONES	No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.

SPOCK	You're saying... It is a compliment.
BONES	It is.

DOCTOR	Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
BONES	We're just -- observing.
DOCTOR	I was not informed about observers.

DOCTOR	What the hell do you think you're doing?
BONES	Reading the patient's vital signs.

DOCTOR	What's your degree in, dentistry?
BONES	How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
DOCTOR	Fundoscopic examination --
BONES	Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
DOCTOR	A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
BONES	My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!

CAPTAIN	What's causing that!?
SCIENCE OFFICER	Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
CAPTAIN	Can you isolate the wave?
SCIENCE OFFICER	Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!

CAPTAIN	Damage report!
SCIENCE OFFICER	Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
CAPTAIN	We're out of control -- Rig for collision...

UHURA	Find it?
CHEKOV	Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.

CHEKOV	Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
UHURA	I have the coordinates of the reactor...
CHEKOV	... It gives me a great sense of history.
UHURA	It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.

UHURA	How long?
CHEKOV	Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.

FBI AGENT	All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
CHEKOV	Like what?
FBI AGENT	Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.

CHEKOV	My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
FBI AGENT	All right. Let's take it from the top.
CHEKOV	The top of what?
FBI AGENT	Name?
CHEKOV	My name?
FBI AGENT	No, <u>my</u> name.
CHEKOV	I do not know your name.
FBI AGENT	You play games with me and you're through
CHEKOV	I am? May I go now?

FBI AGENT	Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
CHEKOV	I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
FBI AGENT	Go ahead. Stun me.
CHEKOV	I'm wery sorry, but --

CHEKOV	Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
KIRK	I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
CHEKOV	We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
KIRK	Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.

CHEKOV	No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
KIRK	That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?

KIRK	Shields, Mr. Chekov.
CHEKOV	Shields, aye.
KIRK	May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!

KIRK	No choice now, Scotty!
CHEKOV	Sir, heat shields at maximum!

CHEKOV	Yes, sir.
KIRK	Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.

KIRK	Ah, well done, team 2.
CHEKOV	And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
KIRK	Understood. What is your plan?

CHEKOV	Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
KIRK	Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:

CHEKOV	The mains are down, sir! Aux power is not responding.
KIRK	Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!

COUNCIL PRESIDENT	Status report, Admiral!
MORROW	Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
COUNCIL PRESIDENT	Neutralized? How?
MORROW	We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
COUNCIL PRESIDENT	Can you protect us?
MORROW	We are launching everything we have.

SPOCK	To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
GILLIAN	Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.

SPOCK	Attempting the hell to communicate.
GILLIAN	Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!

SPOCK	They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
GILLIAN	I suppose they told you that...?
SPOCK	The hell they did.

GILLIAN	So you were at Berkeley.
SPOCK	I was not.

SPOCK	Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
GILLIAN	You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?

GILLIAN	You sure you won't change your mind?
SPOCK	Is there something wrong with the one I have?

KIRK	You mean man...
GILLIAN	To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.

GILLIAN	They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
KIRK	It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...

GILLIAN	Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
KIRK	Why's that?
GILLIAN	Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
KIRK	How soon?
GILLIAN	Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.

GILLIAN	Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
KIRK	I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
GILLIAN	The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...

KIRK	Back to San Francisco.
GILLIAN	Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
KIRK	There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
GILLIAN	I buy that. What about him?
KIRK	He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
GILLIAN	LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
KIRK	We don't want to be any trouble.
GILLIAN	You've already been that. C'mon.

KIRK	Thanks.
GILLIAN	Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.

KIRK	Memory problems, too.
GILLIAN	Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
KIRK	Iowa.
GILLIAN	A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
KIRK	Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
GILLIAN	Go ahead.
KIRK	What's going to happen when you release the whales?

GILLIAN	They're gonna hafta take their chances.
KIRK	What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
GILLIAN	It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?

KIRK	No, ma'am. No dipshit.
GILLIAN	Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.

GILLIAN	All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
KIRK	We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
GILLIAN	Then --
KIRK	In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
GILLIAN	Or believe, I'll bet.
KIRK	Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.

KIRK	Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
GILLIAN	How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.

GILLIAN	He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
KIRK	It's his way.

GILLIAN	Do you trust me?
KIRK	Implicitly.
GILLIAN	Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.

KIRK	So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
GILLIAN	Just lucky, I guess.
KIRK	You're upset about losing the whales.
GILLIAN	... You're very perceptive.
KIRK	How will that be done, exactly?
GILLIAN	They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
KIRK	Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
GILLIAN	See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
KIRK	You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
GILLIAN	You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.

GILLIAN	Thanks. Cheers.
KIRK	If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
GILLIAN	I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.

GILLIAN	Where could you take them?
KIRK	Hm?
GILLIAN	My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
KIRK	It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
GILLIAN	Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
KIRK	What do you mean now?
GILLIAN	Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.

GILLIAN	What's that?
KIRK	What's what?
GILLIAN	You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?

GILLIAN	Wanna try it from the top?
KIRK	Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
GILLIAN	... Who are you?
KIRK	Who do you think I am?

GILLIAN	Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
KIRK	No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
GILLIAN	Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
KIRK	All right. The truth?
GILLIAN	I'm all ears.
KIRK	That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
GILLIAN	Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
KIRK	You want the details?
GILLIAN	Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
KIRK	Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
GILLIAN	Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
KIRK	Noon tomorrow...?!

GILLIAN	Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
KIRK	You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?

GILLIAN	Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
KIRK	It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
GILLIAN	So. There we are.
KIRK	Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
GILLIAN	I bet you're a damn good poker player.
KIRK	Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
GILLIAN	Here... In the park?
KIRK	Right.

GILLIAN	It's true... what you said...
KIRK	Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...

KIRK	Steady, now. We need your help.
GILLIAN	Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
KIRK	It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
GILLIAN	But Kirk...
KIRK	We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
GILLIAN	Kirk. They're gone.
KIRK	... Gone?!
GILLIAN	They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
KIRK	... Damn!

GILLIAN	What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
KIRK	A spaceship with a missing man.

GILLIAN	If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
KIRK	Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!

KIRK	Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
GILLIAN	Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
KIRK	All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
GILLIAN	What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
KIRK	You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
GILLIAN	What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
KIRK	I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
GILLIAN	All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
KIRK	Thank you. For everything.  Beam me up, Scotty.

KIRK	You tricked me.
GILLIAN	You need me.

GILLIAN	Oh my God, we're too late!
KIRK	Mr. Sulu: full power descent!

GILLIAN	... What does that mean?
KIRK	He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
GILLIAN	I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
KIRK	... You have a point...

KIRK	Hey! -- Where you going?!
GILLIAN	You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
KIRK	You mean this is -- goodbye?
GILLIAN	Why does it have to be goodbye?
KIRK	Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
GILLIAN	Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...

SPOCK	Permission to come aboard.
KIRK	Permission granted.
SPOCK	Thank you, Admiral.
KIRK	Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
SPOCK	It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
KIRK	Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.

KIRK	Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
SPOCK	A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
KIRK	Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?

KIRK	Where are you going?!
SPOCK	To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.

KIRK	Spock...?
SPOCK	As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
KIRK	Whales?

KIRK	Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
SPOCK	The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
KIRK	Is there any other planet where this species exists?
SPOCK	The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
KIRK	That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
SPOCK	That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
KIRK	But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
SPOCK	There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.

KIRK	Mr. Spock, your computations?
SPOCK	In progress, Admiral.
KIRK	Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.

SPOCK	Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
KIRK	What is our target in time?
SPOCK	The late 20th Century.
KIRK	Surely you can be more specific...
SPOCK	Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
KIRK	What are the variables...?
SPOCK	Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
KIRK	You've programmed that from memory...?
SPOCK	I have.

KIRK	Earth... But when?... Spock?
SPOCK	Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
KIRK	Well done, Mr. Spock.

KIRK	Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
SPOCK	Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
KIRK	Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!

SPOCK	There is a 20th Century possibility.
KIRK	Explain.
SPOCK	If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
KIRK	But you said toxic.
SPOCK	We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
KIRK	Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
SPOCK	Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...

SPOCK	Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
KIRK	And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?

KIRK	Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
SPOCK	Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.

KIRK	I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
SPOCK	How do you know this...?
KIRK	... Simple logic.

SPOCK	As you observed, a primitive Culture.
KIRK	Yes.
SPOCK	Admiral, may I ask you a question?
KIRK	Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
SPOCK	Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
KIRK	You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
SPOCK	For example?

KIRK	Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
SPOCK	Ah... The giants.

KIRK	Come on, fellah -- speak up!
SPOCK	Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.

KIRK	Spock...
SPOCK	Yes?
KIRK	About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
SPOCK	Why not?
KIRK	Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
SPOCK	I see.
KIRK	And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
SPOCK	I cannot tell a lie.
KIRK	You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
SPOCK	Exaggerate.
KIRK	You've done it before. Can't you remember?
SPOCK	The hell I can't
KIRK	What else did you learn from your mind meld?
SPOCK	They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
KIRK	They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
SPOCK	I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
KIRK	... I see.

KIRK	It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
SPOCK	How will playing cards help?

SPOCK	I meant --
KIRK	He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.

KIRK	Status?
SPOCK	The tank will be finished by morning...
KIRK	That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
SPOCK	No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
KIRK	Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
SPOCK	In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
KIRK	Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!

SPOCK	Admiral. Full power is restored.
KIRK	Thank you, Spock.

SPOCK	Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
KIRK	Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
SPOCK	No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
KIRK	Right.  Will you help us?

KIRK	Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
SPOCK	Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.

KIRK	Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
SPOCK	Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
KIRK	<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.

KIRK	Can we make breakaway speed!?
SPOCK	Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.

KIRK	Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
SPOCK	They did, Admiral.
KIRK	Then... Where the hell are we?

KIRK	Spock: Condition report!
SPOCK	No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.

KIRK	You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
SPOCK	I will, Admiral.

SULU	Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
KIRK	Weapons systems?

SULU	Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
KIRK	Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?

SULU	Warp two... three...
KIRK	Steady as she goes...

SULU	Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
KIRK	Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
SULU	Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
KIRK	Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!

KIRK	Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
SULU	... Aye sir...?
KIRK	What is our condition?
SULU	Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
KIRK	Picture, please.

SULU	Aye, sir. Descending.
KIRK	We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.

SULU	Ready sir.
KIRK	Go, Mr. Sulu.

SULU	Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
KIRK	Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
SULU	Three-one-zero, aye!
KIRK	Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!

SULU	10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
KIRK	Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
SULU	Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.

SULU	10 seconds, sir!
KIRK	Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...

SULU	I have no control, sir!
KIRK	Picture, Uhura!

SULU	Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
KIRK	Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --

KIRK	Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
SULU	Aye, sir!

KIRK	Systems report.  Communications?
UHURA	Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
KIRK	Mr. Sulu?

KIRK	What is it?
UHURA	Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
KIRK	On screen!

KIRK	Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
UHURA	Yes, sir.

UHURA	Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
KIRK	On speakers.

UHURA	Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
KIRK	From a city? That doesn't make sense....

UHURA	I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
KIRK	Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.

KIRK	We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
UHURA	283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
KIRK	Everyone remember where we parked.

KIRK	Any luck...?
UHURA	Nothing... I should never have left him...
KIRK	Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...

UHURA	I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
KIRK	Uhura!... Where!
UHURA	Mercy Hospital.

KIRK	Bearing!
UHURA	Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
KIRK	Put them on screen!

UHURA	Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
KIRK	On screen.

KIRK	Estimate range, ship to whales!
UHURA	Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.

UHURA	Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
KIRK	Mr. Scott -- how soon?

UHURA	I can't, sir -- Nothing!
KIRK	Out of control, and blind as a bat!

KIRK	Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
SCOTTY	Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.

SCOTTY	We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
KIRK	Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.

KIRK	Scotty, how long is this bay?
SCOTTY	About 60 feet, Admiral.
KIRK	That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
SCOTTY	I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?

KIRK	Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
SCOTTY	Humpbacked - people.?
KIRK	Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
SCOTTY	Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
KIRK	You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
SCOTTY	Two?
KIRK	It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.

SCOTTY	They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
KIRK	Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
SCOTTY	Oh, twenty-four hours, give or take, staying cloaked. After that, Admiral, we'll be visible -- and dead in the water. In any case, we won't have enough to break out of the Earth's gravity, to say nothing of getting back home.

KIRK	I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
SCOTTY	Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.

KIRK	What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
SCOTTY	Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
KIRK	Oh I see --  Tell Them phasers on stun. Good luck. Kirk out.

SCOTTY	It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
KIRK	Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
SCOTTY	I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.

SCOTTY	I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
KIRK	Mr. Sulu?

KIRK	Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
SCOTTY	Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.

SCOTTY	Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
KIRK	How long, Scotty?
SCOTTY	10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.

SCOTTY	Admiral! There be whales here!
KIRK	Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
SCOTTY	I'll have to re-energize.
KIRK	Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.

SCOTTY	Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
KIRK	Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
SCOTTY	Full power, sir.
KIRK	Mr. Sulu, if you please.

KIRK	Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
SCOTTY	The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.

SCOTTY	You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
KIRK	On my way...!

KIRK	The whales...?!
SCOTTY	No power to the bay doors.
KIRK	The explosive override -- ?
SCOTTY	It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
KIRK	Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
SCOTTY	Admiral, you'll be trapped!

SCOTTY	Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
KIRK	Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.

SAAVIK	Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
KIRK	Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
SAAVIK	And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
KIRK	Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
SAAVIK	I am well, Admiral.
KIRK	You will be in good hands here.

KIRK	Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
SAAVIK	Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.

KLINGON AMBASSADOR	Even as the Federation negotiated a peace treaty with us, Kirk was secretly developing the Genesis torpedo! Conceived by Kirk's son and test detonated by the Admiral himself!  The result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "The Genesis Planet..." A secret base from which to launch the. annihilation of the Klingon people!  We demand the extradition of Kirk! We demand justice!
SAREK	Klingon justice is a unique point of view, Mr. President.

SAREK	Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
KLINGON AMBASSADOR	Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
SAREK	Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
KLINGON AMBASSADOR	We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
SAREK	Do you have the right to murder?

SCOTTY	Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
NICHOLS	Millions?

NICHOLS	Professor Scott, if you'll --
SCOTTY	I demand to see the owners! I demand --

NICHOLS	With pleasure.
SCOTTY	Well, that's different.
NICHOLS	If you'll follow me, Professor --
SCOTTY	I will. Can my assistant come, too?
NICHOLS	Of course.

SCOTTY	Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
NICHOLS	... Yes?
SCOTTY	I notice you're still working with polymers.
NICHOLS	Sill? What else would I be working with?
SCOTTY	Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
NICHOLS	That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
SCOTTY	Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
NICHOLS	... Are you joking?

SCOTTY	Hello? Computer...?
NICHOLS	Just use the keyboard...
SCOTTY	The keyboard... How quaint.

NICHOLS	Transparent aluminum?
SCOTTY	That's the ticket, laddie.
NICHOLS	... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!

PILOT	Hi.
SULU	Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
PILOT	Right on. You fly?
SULU	Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
PILOT	All right, then this is old stuff to you.
SULU	Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?

SPOCK	Father...?
SAREK	I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
SPOCK	It is kind of you to make this effort.
SAREK	It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
SPOCK	Most kind, Father.

SAREK	As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
SPOCK	They are my friends.
SAREK	Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
SPOCK	Tell her I feel fine...

THE BOY	Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
SULU	Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
THE BOY	Ah, chigaau hito da. Hanashi kata ga okashii.  Yes, this must be true. You talk funny.

SULU	Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
THE BOY	Sulu Hikaru.
SULU	Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
THE BOY	Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.

ALAN	Just passing through Santa Carla?
SAM	No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?

SAM	I don't like horror comics.
ALAN	This one could save your life.

ALAN	How do you like Santa Carla?
SAM	It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.

ALAN	Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
SAM	This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.

ALAN	We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
SAM	You better get some fresh air.

SAM	I don't like horror comics.
ALAN	Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
SAM	I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.

SAM	All day.
ALAN	Can't stand light?
SAM	Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.

ALAN	Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
SAM	Yeah.
ALAN	He's a vampire alright.

ALAN	Why not?
SAM	He's my brother.
ALAN	You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy.

ALAN	They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
SAM	Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?

SAM	<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
ALAN	We don't ride with vampires.
SAM	Fine!  Stay here!

SAM	Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
ALAN	We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!

ALAN	They're gaining on us!
SAM	You gotta drive!

SAM	Well... we blew Plan A.
ALAN	Time to activate Plan B.
SAM	What's Plan B?

EDGAR	We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
ALAN	Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
EDGAR	As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.

EDGAR	All together?
ALAN	Zero.

EDGAR	Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
EDGAR	The Prince of Darkness.
ALAN	The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
EDGAR	El Vampiro.

ALAN	Should I run him through?
EDGAR	I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?

EDGAR	Shut up!
ALAN	We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
EDGAR	They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!

EDGAR	They're looking at us.
ALAN	They're gonna book us.

ALAN	Good.
EDGAR	That's just the way we like it.

ALAN	Did you see that sucker burn?!
EDGAR	Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
ALAN	Two down and two to go.
EDGAR	<u>Four</u> to go.
ALAN	Whattaya mean?
EDGAR	Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
ALAN	You know what?  You're absolutely right.

EDGAR	Death to all vampires!
ALAN	Maximum body-count.
EDGAR	We are awesome monster-bashers!
ALAN	The meanest!
EDGAR	The baddest!

MICHAEL	We still going?
DAVID	Honda 250, huh?
MICHAEL	That's right.
DAVID	C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
MICHAEL	Star?...

MICHAEL	I can't beat a Triumph.
DAVID	You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.

MICHAEL	We were gonna grab some food.
DAVID	Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.

DAVID	So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
MICHAEL	What?...
DAVID	You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?

MICHAEL	Don't!  Stop!
DAVID	Why?  They're only noodles.

MICHAEL	I'm my own man.
DAVID	Get your bike.  We're going someplace.

MICHAEL	What's going' on?
DAVID	What's goin' on, Marko?

MICHAEL	Where is she?!
DAVID	Hey, take it easy.
MICHAEL	Where's Star, David?!
DAVID	If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.

MICHAEL	What is this, David?
DAVID	You're one of us, now -- aren't you?

DAVID	Where you going?
STAR	For a ride.
DAVID	With him?
STAR	Yeah.

STAR	C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
DAVID	No.  Stick around.

STAR	Leave him alone.
DAVID	Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.

STAR	Look.
DAVID	You're almost one of us now, Michael.

DAVID	You can't kill me, Star.
STAR	I will, David!
DAVID	No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.

SAM	And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
EDGAR	Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
SAM	Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...

EDGAR	Or a vampire.
SAM	Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
EDGAR	You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.

EDGAR	This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
SAM	Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.

EDGAR	Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
SAM	His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.

EDGAR	Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
SAM	I can't do that!

SAM	I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
EDGAR	That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
SAM	Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'

EDGAR	I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
SAM	How do you know they're not?

EDGAR	He's not glowing.
SAM	Hit the lights again.

SAM	He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
EDGAR	To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.

EDGAR	Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
SAM	Chill out Edgar.

SAM	What's that smell!?
EDGAR	Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.

SAM	I thought they'd be in coffins.
EDGAR	That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.

SAM	Oh, no...
EDGAR	What?
SAM	There's a cop behind us.

SAM	No, Nanook!  Quiet!
EDGAR	Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!

EDGAR	We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
SAM	What happens in tow and a half hours?
EDGAR	The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.

MICHAEL	Of course not!
EDGAR	If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.

MICHAEL	David.
EDGAR	I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
MICHAEL	I'll take you there.

MICHAEL	I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
EDGAR	Okay, okay.

EDGAR	Don't go out there!  Stop him!
MICHAEL	Sam, don't --

GRANDPA	Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
LUCY	A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.

GRANDPA	Ouch, my hair...
LUCY	When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.

LUCY	I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
GRANDPA	Closet monster!?

LUCY	Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
GRANDPA	It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.

GRANDPA	Smells good.  When do we eat?
LUCY	I told Max eight o'clock.
GRANDPA	Max?  You men we're having company again?
LUCY	'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
GRANDPA	Right.  An' now we're having company <u>again</u>.  I'll take mine to go.

GRANDPA	... And stay outta here.
SAM	You have a T.V.?
GRANDPA	No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...

SAM	Thanks, Grandpa...
GRANDPA	Lots more where he came from.

SAM	Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
GRANDPA	Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
SAM	Good!
GRANDPA	Whatcha doin' over here?
SAM	Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
GRANDPA	Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
SAM	Great.  I wanna get some new comics.

GRANDPA	Are we havin' fun or what?
SAM	I thought we were goin' into town.
GRANDPA	I hate goin' into town.  That's about as close to town as I like to get.

SAM	Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
GRANDPA	Did we have a date tonight?
SAM	I guess so.  She said not to be late.
GRANDPA	I better get cleaned up, then.

LADDIE	Hi... I'm Laddie.
STAR	This is Michael.

LADDIE	I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
STAR	Who, Laddie?
LADDIE	I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
STAR	Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
LADDIE	It was a dream, Star.
STAR	No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.

STAR	You didn't tell David?
LADDIE	No.  Just you.
STAR	Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.

LADDIE	You like Michael.
STAR	I like Michael.
LADDIE	You better not like him too much.

LUCY	Still mad at me?
MICHAEL	For what.
LUCY	For everything.

MICHAEL	He looks dead.
LUCY	He's just a deep sleeper.
MICHAEL	He's not breathing, Mom.

MICHAEL	It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
LUCY	Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
MICHAEL	I'll hitch.
LUCY	Oh, no, you won't.

MICHAEL	See you later.
LUCY	I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
MICHAEL	I'll pass.

LUCY	Michael, are you still in bed?
MICHAEL	No.  I'm up.
LUCY	Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
MICHAEL	I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
LUCY	Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.

LUCY	Okay?
MICHAEL	Okay.

MICHAEL	Sure.
LUCY	Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
MICHAEL	We are...
LUCY	Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --

LUCY	-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
MICHAEL	I'm tired now.
LUCY	Wait a minute, kiddo.
MICHAEL	Mom... please.

LUCY	Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
MICHAEL	Can't.  Got plans of my own.
LUCY	There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
MICHAEL	Gotta go, Mom.

MICHAEL	I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
LUCY	Michael!...
MICHAEL	Get out, Mom!  Run!

LUCY	We're getting close...
SAM	What's that smell?
LUCY	Ocean air!
SAM	Smells like something died.
LUCY	Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...

SAM	Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
LUCY	That's the boardwalk, Sam.
SAM	Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.

LUCY	Tell them to get something to eat.
SAM	I thought we were poor.
LUCY	Not that poor.

SAM	When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
LUCY	You've heard this story before?
SAM	So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.

SAM	Help me, Mom.  Help.
LUCY	Soon.

SAM	He met a girl.
LUCY	I guess no one cares what I got a job.
SAM	Can we get a T.V.?

LUCY	Lights out, Sam.
SAM	Soon as I finish this comic.  Okay?

LUCY	Sam.  Is everything all right?
SAM	Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
LUCY	What's wrong?  Tell me.
SAM	We can't talk about it on the phone.

LUCY	Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
SAM	Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...

LUCY	Where's Michael?
SAM	He's already gone to bed.

SAM	Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
LUCY	In here?
SAM	Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
LUCY	Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.

SAM	These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
LUCY	Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
SAM	Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
LUCY	No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...

LUCY	Nanook, stop breathin' on me.
SAM	C'mere, Nanook.

LUCY	Oh, no.  Now what?
SAM	Must be a circuit breaker.

LUCY	What did you say?
SAM	Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
LUCY	Not funny, Sam!
SAM	This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
LUCY	Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
SAM	But, Mom...
LUCY	Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
SAM	No, I'm not...
LUCY	There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
SAM	-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!

LUCY	Ohmygod...
SAM	Mom!
LUCY	What happened?  Is everybody all right?!

MAX	You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
LUCY	Lucy.
MAX	So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
LUCY	I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
MAX	-- a job.
LUCY	Do I look that needy?

MAX	Say hello to Thorn.
LUCY	Hi, Thorn.

LUCY	You're cute, Max.
MAX	I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.

MAX	Not impressed, are you?
LUCY	Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.

MAX	So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
LUCY	You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
MAX	But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
LUCY	I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
MAX	Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
LUCY	I hear this is the decade for cute.

MAX	Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
LUCY	You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
MAX	Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.

MAX	This looks terrific, Lucy.
LUCY	Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!

LUCY	Max!  What's wrong?
MAX	It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...

LUCY	I'm really sorry, Max.
MAX	Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
LUCY	I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
MAX	Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
LUCY	He doesn't walk all over me.
MAX	I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.

MAX	Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
LUCY	I hope so.

MAX	Something the matter?
LUCY	No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
MAX	Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
LUCY	I thought you said they needed discipline?
MAX	Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.

LUCY	Max... what are you talking about?
MAX	It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.

LUCY	Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
MAX	It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.

SAM	How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
MAX	Okay, Sam.  Thanks.

SAM	Does it burn?
MAX	Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!

SAM	I am?
MAX	Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.

SAM	But you passed the test!
MAX	Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
SAM	What?!  Did you know that!?

STAR	Are you following me?
MICHAEL	Well, I...
STAR	Did you want to talk to me?

MICHAEL	Well... yeah.  Sure.
STAR	Okay.  Talk.
MICHAEL	I just wanted to... I, uh...

MICHAEL	Hi...
STAR	If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.

MICHAEL	What's your name?
STAR	Star.
MICHAEL	Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
STAR	What do you mean?
MICHAEL	Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
STAR	Me, too.
MICHAEL	I'm Michael.
STAR	Michael's great.  I like Michael.

STAR	I guess you're new around here.
MICHAEL	Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.

MICHAEL	Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
STAR	Okay.

MICHAEL	Ouch.
STAR	Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.

MICHAEL	I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
STAR	I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
MICHAEL	Now you and David...
STAR	No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
MICHAEL	Let's go see them.
STAR	No... no, everything's different now...

MICHAEL	I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
STAR	Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
MICHAEL	When?
STAR	Tonight.  At the boardwalk...

STAR	I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?
MICHAEL	Okay.

MICHAEL	Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
STAR	Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
MICHAEL	That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
STAR	Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
MICHAEL	Why not?
STAR	Because I love you...
MICHAEL	Then it's not too late for us...
STAR	It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
MICHAEL	I know, I've felt it...
STAR	I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.

STAR	David's looking for me... I have to go.
MICHAEL	You're not going anywhere...  Sam...

MICHAEL	You've got to put this on.
STAR	Take laddie.
MICHAEL	Huh?
STAR	Save Laddie first.

STAR	They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
MICHAEL	They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.

MICHAEL	It's gone.  I feel it!
STAR	So do I!

SAM	What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
MICHAEL	That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.

MICHAEL	This is kind of a cool place.
SAM	I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
MICHAEL	Will you give Mom a break?

SAM	Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
MICHAEL	Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
SAM	Even poor people have T.V.s

MICHAEL	This room is mine.
SAM	I was here first.
MICHAEL	Okay.  I'll flip you for it.

MICHAEL	You're beautiful.
SAM	Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.

SAM	Where are we going?
MICHAEL	Nowhere.
SAM	Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
MICHAEL	Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?

SAM	Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
MICHAEL	Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?

SAM	Do I have to do this?
MICHAEL	Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'

MICHAEL	Go away.
SAM	You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
MICHAEL	Entertain yourself.

SAM	What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
MICHAEL	I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.

SAM	You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
MICHAEL	What would that make Mom?
SAM	You're right... not even to mention you and me.

SAM	Did you spill something?
MICHAEL	No.  Why?
SAM	The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.

MICHAEL	I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
SAM	Wanna go to the comic book store?
MICHAEL	No.

MICHAEL	Mom's home?...
SAM	No.  On the phone.

SAM	I'm making you a sandwich.
MICHAEL	Don't bother.

SAM	Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
MICHAEL	Piss off.
SAM	You have such a great personality, Michael.   You should open your own charm school.

SAM	Michael?
MICHAEL	Don't turn on the light.

SAM	What happened, Michael!?
MICHAEL	Nanook...
SAM	What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
MICHAEL	Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!

SAM	What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
MICHAEL	He was protecting <u>you</u>!

MICHAEL	What??
SAM	Look at your reflection in the mirror!!

MICHAEL	We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
SAM	What about Mom?
MICHAEL	No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
SAM	I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
MICHAEL	Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.

SAM	It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
MICHAEL	I don't know.

MICHAEL	Star.
SAM	Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...

MICHAEL	Who are you calling?
SAM	The Marines.

SAM	Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
MICHAEL	Huh?...

SAM	What's the matter?
MICHAEL	I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?

BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER	Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
TED	What?
BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER	You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
TED	I'll try to be more careful.
BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER	S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
TED	The thing's kind of heavy.
BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER	Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
TED	No, I just meant...
BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER	Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.

TED	Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
DETECTIVE CAVALLO	So you admit it?
TED	Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...

DETECTIVE CAVALLO	Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
TED	Jeez, I didn't catch it.

DETECTIVE CAVALLO	This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
TED	Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?

DETECTIVE CAVALLO	No harm, no foul?
TED	I guess.

DOM	Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
MARY	You sent that?
DOM	Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
MARY	Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
DOM	That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
MARY	That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.

DOM	Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
MARY	Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
DOM	All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.

MARY	I'm asking you to leave.
DOM	Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
DOM	...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
MARY	Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!

MARY	Stop it!
DOM	Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!

DOM	Gay? He said you were gay?
TED	He implied it.
DOM	Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
TED	Yeah, but he was successful.
DOM	Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?

TED	Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
DOM	I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
TED	What's he like?

DOM	You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
TED	Good-looking?
DOM	I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.

TED	What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump.  Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
DOM	Loser? You?

DOM	Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
TED	Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
DOM	I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.

TED	It must be great with a wife like that.
DOM	Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
TED	Nah.
DOM	Never?
TED	Well once. Mary.

DOM	Mary again.
TED	Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
DOM	Whatever happened to Mary?
TED	I told you, her family moved to Miami.
DOM	I mean since then.
TED	I don't know.
DOM	Well why don't you look her up?
TED	Yeah, right.
DOM	Why not?
TED	Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
DOM	What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
TED	I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
DOM	So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
TED	I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
DOM	You're kidding? What did they say?
TED	They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
DOM	I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.

TED	I don't know about this, Dom.
DOM	Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
TED	His mother?
DOM	Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
TED	And you think he could find out her number for me?
DOM	He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.

TED	That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
DOM	Hey, look on the bright side --
TED	What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
DOM	Well... at least now you know.
TED	I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.

TED	What's so funny?
DOM	I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!

TED	Wait a second, I never told you that.
DOM	Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.

TED	Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
DOM	What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
TED	Never met him.
DOM	Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
TED	Amen to that.

TED	Mary's a babe!
DOM	What?
TED	My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
DOM	Huh? But why did Healy?
TED	Well think about it.

DOM	No You mean...?
TED	Uh-huh.
DOM	The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
TED	That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.

DOM	Well then you've got to call her, man.
TED	Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.

DOM	You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
TED	I am?
DOM	Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
TED	Yeah feels like it.

TED	How the hell did you get here anyway?
DOM	Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.

TED	Shoot.
DOM	Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
TED	And this adversely affects me how...?
DOM	Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!

TED	Fuck me.  Let's go home.
DOM	No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.

DOM	Well? What are you waiting for?
TED	I don't know what to say.
DOM	Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
TED	Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.

TED	Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
DOM	Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
TED	Got cash.
DOM	Car clean? Plenty of gas?
TED	Check.
DOM	Mints?
TED	Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.

DOM	Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
TED	Hm?
DOM	You know, clean the pipes.
TED	Pipes? What are you talking about?
DOM	You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.

DOM	Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
TED	No.

DOM	Why's that?
TED	I'm usually too tired to be.

DOM	Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
TED	Huh.
DOM	The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
TED	Jesus Christ you're right.
DOM	You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
TED	Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
DOM	People get hurt that way.

TED	Dom? What are you?
DOM	You stole her from me. Now I want her back.

DOM	Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
TED	But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
DOM	If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.

DR. LALONDE	So... I see you made the news.
TED	It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
DR. LALONDE	Uh-huh. Where was he?
TED	Out getting coffee.
DR. LALONDE	Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...

TED	Bob, do you remember Mary?
DR. LALONDE	Who?
TED	Mary.
DR. LALONDE	From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.

TED	A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
DR. LALONDE	I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.

FRIEND #1	Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?
TED	Who?

TED	Who?
FRIEND #1	Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.

TED	Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
FRIEND #1	Loser? Woogie was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class.

FRIEND #1	I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
TED	Oh come on, why would I lie?
FRIEND #1	Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.

MAGDA	This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
HEALY	Call you back.

MAGDA	You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
HEALY	'That right?
MAGDA	He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
HEALY	Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'

MAGDA	Would you like a glass of tea or something?
HEALY	You got a brew?

MAGDA	Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
HEALY	No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!

HEALY	We're in love with your roommate.
MAGDA	Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.

SULLY	Healy you dog!
HEALY	Fucking Sully! Look at you!
SULLY	You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.

SULLY	Here's the info you asked for.
HEALY	Thanks.
SULLY	You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
HEALY	Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
SULLY	Stalker, huh?
HEALY	Big time.

HEALY	Very nice.
SULLY	I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.

HEALY	Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
SULLY	What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
HEALY	Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
SULLY	Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
HEALY	Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?

SULLY	Take it easy, that's Bill.
HEALY	Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
SULLY	Relax, he just ate.

SULLY	Nineteen months I been sober.
HEALY	What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
SULLY	Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
HEALY	Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.

HEALY	Here, just have one of these then.
SULLY	Healy, what I just tell you?
HEALY	This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
SULLY	No I can't.

HEALY	I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
SULLY	Am I?
HEALY	Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.

SULLY	Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
HEALY	Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?

HEALY	Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
SULLY	Who the fuck is it to you?
HEALY	Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?

HEALY	Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
SULLY	You found my car?!

SULLY	So where the hell are you, Healy?
HEALY	Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
SULLY	The sawbones?
HEALY	Yep.

HEALY	Oh yeah.
SULLY	Dumbshit.

SULLY	Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
HEALY	I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.

SULLY	But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
HEALY	Ahh.

HEALY	The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
SULLY	Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
HEALY	You said it, mister.  I gotta go.

MARY	I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
HEALY	A girl after your own heart, Ted.

MARY	Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
HEALY	Thanks.

HEALY	I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
MARY	No thanks.

HEALY	Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
MARY	Nepal? Have you been?
HEALY	Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
MARY	You own a home there?
HEALY	Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
MARY	Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
HEALY	Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.

HEALY	Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
MARY	Thanks.

MARY	Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
HEALY	Same here again.
MARY	By the way, what's your name?
HEALY	Pat Healy.

MARY	Don't you want to know my name?
HEALY	I already know it, Mary.
MARY	How'd you know that?
HEALY	It's right there on your golf bag.

MARY	What are you doing with all these blueprints?
HEALY	Some buildings I'm working on.
MARY	Are you... an architect?
HEALY	Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

HEALY	I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
MARY	What's that?
HEALY	I work with retards.
MARY	I beg your pardon?
HEALY	You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
MARY	Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
HEALY	The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
MARY	No, I mean
HEALY	-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
MARY	-- He's in a cage?!
HEALY	Well it's more of an enclosure really.
MARY	They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
HEALY	That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
MARY	That sounds like fun.
HEALY	Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
MARY	Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.

HEALY	Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
MARY	Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.

MARY	Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
HEALY	Great.

HEALY	Fine. Fine.
MARY	Here you go.  What's that smell?

HEALY	The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
MARY	We will, but first I have a surprise.
HEALY	A surprise?
MARY	The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.

MARY	I know he's around here someplace.
HEALY	What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
MARY	We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?

MARY	Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
HEALY	Deco.
MARY	Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
HEALY	That...? Vestibule.
MARY	How about -- ?
HEALY	When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.

HEALY	That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
MARY	Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
HEALY	And it doesn't cramp your style?
MARY	Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
HEALY	Lint?
MARY	Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...

HEALY	You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
MARY	Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?

HEALY	Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
MARY	You're a movie buff?
HEALY	Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
MARY	Have you seen it?
HEALY	No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
MARY	A fucking moron.
HEALY	Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.

MARY	Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
HEALY	Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
MARY	Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
HEALY	-- Love story of our time.

MARY	Yeah.
HEALY	Wow. I thought I was the only one.

MARY	So...
HEALY	Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
MARY	I guess.
HEALY	Well, I'll see ya.

HEALY	Mary ah, forget it.
MARY	What?
HEALY	No, forget it, it was stupid.
MARY	Come on, what were you going to say?
HEALY	Nah, really, it was moronic.

HEALY	Fuck!!
MARY	Huh... that's strange.

MARY	Turn it up, Magda.
HEALY	Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.

MARY	All set.
HEALY	You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?

HEALY	How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
MARY	Forget it. It was... fun.

HEALY	Urrggghh...
MARY	Warren!

MARY	Are you okay?
HEALY	Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
MARY	Sure.

HEALY	No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MARY	We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.

HEALY	Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
MARY	Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.

MARY	Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
HEALY	Who the hell's Woogie?

HEALY	I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
MARY	Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.

HEALY	So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
TED	Uh-huh.
HEALY	Any idea where I might start looking?
TED	She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
HEALY	All you want is a phone number?
TED	Well, I know you're busy...
HEALY	Don't play games with me, Ted.
TED	I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
HEALY	I don't buy it.
TED	You don't buy what?

HEALY	Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
TED	No.
HEALY	She's blackmailing you, right?
TED	No.
HEALY	You want her dead, don't you?
TED	You can't be serious.
HEALY	Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
TED	I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
HEALY	Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
TED	Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
HEALY	I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
TED	You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.

HEALY	I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
TED	Really?  Very, very?

HEALY	I think your life's about to change.
TED	So you found Mary?
HEALY	Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
TED	So she hasn't changed?
HEALY	That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
TED	No, not at all.
HEALY	Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.

TED	Mary's a little chubby, huh?
HEALY	I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.

HEALY	But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
TED	So she's married?
HEALY	Nope. Never been.
TED	Huh?
HEALY	Four kids, three different guys.
TED	Three different guys?
HEALY	Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
TED	Oh my.
HEALY	Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
TED	She's in a wheelchair?!

HEALY	Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
TED	It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
HEALY	Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.

TED	Thanks, Healy. Good work.
HEALY	Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
TED	Uh, that's okay.
HEALY	You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!

TED	What are you doing?
HEALY	Oh, uh, I resigned.

TED	Miami?
HEALY	Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
TED	Jai alai?
HEALY	Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.

TED	Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
HEALY	Good good.
TED	Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
HEALY	Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
TED	But you said she was a sparkplug...?
HEALY	I said buttplug. She's heinous.

TED	All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
HEALY	It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
TED	Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.

HEALY	Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
TED	Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
HEALY	You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.

TED	Mary's a mail-order bride?
HEALY	Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.

HEALY	Hey, hey, hey!
TED	Surprised?

TED	You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
HEALY	What do you mean 'why'?
TED	Answer the question, shitball.

HEALY	Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
TED	Do what?
HEALY	Turn her over to a stalker.
TED	What?! You're calling me a stalker?
HEALY	That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!

HEALY	Oh Christ... poor dog.
TED	You're a sick man, you know that?
HEALY	Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
TED	Your turn?
HEALY	That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.

TED	Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
HEALY	I don't know what you're talking about.
TED	I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
HEALY	What?

TED	Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
HEALY	Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.

TUCKER	Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
HEALY	Same here.

HEALY	Mainly I work out of Boston.
TUCKER	Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
HEALY	Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
TUCKER	Harvard?
HEALY	You bet.
TUCKER	Did you study under Kim Greene?
HEALY	Among others.
TUCKER	Kim and I are close friends!
HEALY	Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
TUCKER	You mean him.

TUCKER	Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
HEALY	Nice smokescreen, isn't it?

HEALY	Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
TUCKER	Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
HEALY	Do you know the... soccer stadium?
TUCKER	Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
HEALY	No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
TUCKER	I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
HEALY	Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.

TUCKER	You know, I really should take your card.
HEALY	Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?

TUCKER	Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
HEALY	Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!

TUCKER	Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
HEALY	Maybe this'll jog your memory.

HEALY	That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
TUCKER	Who?

HEALY	You what?
TUCKER	You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.

TUCKER	I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
HEALY	What do you mean?
TUCKER	I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
HEALY	But... but you knew people at Harvard.
TUCKER	I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
HEALY	Bullshit!

TUCKER	...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
HEALY	And you met Mary how?
TUCKER	Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
HEALY	How'd you manage that one?
TUCKER	Friend. Baseball bat.
HEALY	Nice.
TUCKER	Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
HEALY	Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
TUCKER	What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
HEALY	Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
TUCKER	Why you son of a --

TUCKER	That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
HEALY	Fucking sickening.

HEALY	How many is that?
TUCKER	Four.
HEALY	That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
TUCKER	I never said that.

HEALY	Ho-ly shit.
TUCKER	Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
HEALY	Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!

HEALY	You little fuck.
TUCKER	What?
HEALY	You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.  You crossed the line, man.

TUCKER	I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
HEALY	Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
TUCKER	Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
HEALY	You were following us?
TUCKER	Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?

HEALY	Oh... Sully.
TUCKER	Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?

HITCHHIKER	Thanks for picking me up.
TED	No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
HITCHHIKER	I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
TED	That must make it tough.
HITCHHIKER	Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
TED	Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
HITCHHIKER	Oh. Well I am.
TED	Hm?
HITCHHIKER	A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
TED	'That right? Good for you.
HITCHHIKER	Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea -- it's a home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute Abs?
TED	The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
HITCHHIKER	Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.

TED	I see where you're going.
HITCHHIKER	Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
TED	I'd go with the seven.
HITCHHIKER	Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
TED	How do you guarantee that?
HITCHHIKER	Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
TED	Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.

JOANIE	No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
MARY	Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.

JOANIE	I can live with those reflections.
MARY	I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
JOANIE	Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
MARY	But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.

JOANIE	Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
MARY	What's that supposed to mean?
JOANIE	It means you're too hard on guys.
MARY	No I'm not.
JOANIE	Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.

MARY	Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
JOANIE	All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.

MARY	I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
JOANIE	Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
MARY	Ah, she's okay.

JOANIE	What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
MARY	I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.

MARY	Have you been up all night again?
MAGDA	Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
MARY	Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
MAGDA	These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
MARY	Meaning?
MAGDA	Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
MARY	You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
MAGDA	I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.

MARY	Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
MAGDA	That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
MARY	Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.

MAGDA	Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
MARY	No time, Magda, my show's starting.

MAGDA	So who's the lucky guy?
MARY	Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
MAGDA	Good lookin'?
MARY	He's no Steve Young.

MAGDA	What's he like?
MARY	I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
MAGDA	What's a mook?
MARY	You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
MAGDA	Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
MARY	Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
MAGDA	I don't watch the new ones.
MARY	This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
MAGDA	That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?

MARY	The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
MAGDA	Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.

MARY	Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
MAGDA	Oh, yeah, of course, dear.

MAGDA	Bundt cake?
MARY	Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.

MAGDA	Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
MARY	Healy.

MAGDA	I'm buying bananas tonight.
MARY	Why?
MAGDA	Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
MARY	Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.

MAGDA	Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
MARY	So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
MAGDA	Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
MARY	Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
MAGDA	Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.

MAGDA	An old flame?
MARY	Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.

MAGDA	You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
MARY	I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.

MARY	Holy shit...
MAGDA	Puffy, get over here.

MARY	Magda!
MAGDA	The little shit lied to me about that guy!

MAGDA	Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
MARY	Where's Puffy?
MAGDA	Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.

MARY	Pat's an architect, too.
TUCKER	Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?

MARY	Pat does projects all over the world.
TUCKER	Where would I have seen your work?

TUCKER	What's up, Doc?
MARY	Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?

TUCKER	You don't think they're too big?
MARY	No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.

MARY	He's a nice guy, isn't he?
TUCKER	Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?

MARY	Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
TUCKER	That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
MARY	I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
TUCKER	Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.

TUCKER	I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
MARY	No no no, Tucker, thank you.
TUCKER	I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
MARY	I appreciate you looking out for me.

MARY	Can I pour you one?
TUCKER	Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.

MARY	What's up?
TUCKER	Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.

TUCKER	I think you'd better sit down.
MARY	Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
TUCKER	Mary, the man's a killer.

MARY	What...?
TUCKER	I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.

MARY	I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
TUCKER	Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.

MARY	Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
TUCKER	Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
MARY	Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.

TUCKER	Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
MARY	You mean he's not a criminal?

TUCKER	Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
MARY	Oh Jesus...

TED	Oh yeah. Fine.
MARY	Thanks a lot, Ted.

MARY	Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
TED	No, it's an old football injury.
MARY	Oh, are you on the team?
TED	No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.

MARY	Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
TED	A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?

MARY	So who you taking to the prom?
TED	Huh?
MARY	The prom -- you going?
TED	Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
MARY	'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
TED	I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.

MARY	Hi, Ted.
TED	Hi, Mary.

MARY	I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
TED	Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
MARY	Are you all right?
TED	Oh yeah.

MARY	Ted, are you okay?
TED	Just a minute.

MARY	Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
TED	You betcha!

TED	You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
MARY	Who's that?

MARY	Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
TED	Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
MARY	And did everything -- ?
TED	Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

MARY	I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
TED	Really? I never got a message.
MARY	That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.

MARY	By the way, how's he doing?
TED	He's dead.
MARY	Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
TED	No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.

MARY	Oh. So... what brings you down here?
TED	Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.

MARY	Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
TED	Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
MARY	Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
TED	Oh... are you... ?
MARY	Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
TED	Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?

MARY	I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
TED	Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.

TED	Hey.
MARY	Hi, Ted.
TED	You look great.
MARY	Thanks.

MARY	What's that?
TED	Hm?
MARY	On your ear, you've got something.

TED	Sure.
MARY	Oh great, I ran out.

TED	Now by killer, you mean...?
MARY	I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
TED	Jeez, Mary... I'm...
MARY	Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.

MARY	You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
TED	No short game.

MARY	We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
TED	What are you?
MARY	Twenty-two.
TED	Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.

MARY	Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
TED	That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.

MARY	Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
TED	I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
MARY	I agree there should be more.

TED	You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
MARY	I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
TED	Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.

MARY	It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
TED	Yeah?
MARY	We've got a lot in common.

TED	Well... why don't you move back?
MARY	Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?

MARY	So you're a writer?
TED	Trying to be.
MARY	Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
TED	We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
MARY	That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
TED	What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
MARY	I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.

MARY	...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
TED	Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
MARY	Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
TED	Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.

MARY	Ted... you're not that far ahead.
TED	Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
MARY	Why not?
TED	Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.

MARY	That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
TED	All right, let's go.

MARY	Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
TED	Yeah, sure.

TED	Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
MARY	Toy poodle!

MARY	Get out.
TED	Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
MARY	That you put a murderer on my trail?
TED	Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
MARY	What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?

TED	Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
MARY	Then what the fuck did you do it for?
TED	I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.

MARY	Please leave.
TED	Mary, come on...
MARY	Go!
TED	Okay.

MARY	Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
TED	You're Woogie?

TED	What what are you doing here?
MARY	You forgot your keys!

MARY	Ted...?
TED	I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
MARY	But I think I'd be happiest... with you.

TED	But but what about Steve?
MARY	Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

MARY	Get over here.
TED	Really?
MARY	Really.

MARY'S DAD	Yeah? What do you want?
TED	Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
MARY'S DAD	Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.

MARY'S DAD	Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
TED	I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.

MARY'S DAD	What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
TED	I wish.

TED	I, uh... I got it stuck.
MARY'S DAD	You got what stuck?
TED	It.
MARY'S DAD	It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.

MARY'S DAD	OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
TED	Shhhhhh!
MARY'S DAD	Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
TED	What?! No please, sir --
MARY'S DAD	She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do.

MARY'S DAD	Is it the frank or the beans?
TED	I think a little of both.

TED	One guess.
MARY'S DAD	How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
TED	I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.

MARY'S DAD	You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
TED	No, that's really unneces --

MARY'S MOM	Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.
TED	Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.

MARY'S MOM	Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
TED	Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
MARY'S MOM	Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
TED	What do you mean?
MARY'S MOM	I mean is it... is it...?

TED	No, no, please!
MARY'S MOM	Teddy, be brave.

POLICE OFFICER	Ho there.
TED	Oh God.
POLICE OFFICER	Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.

POLICE OFFICER	Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
TED	I wasn't trying --
POLICE OFFICER	Is that bubble what I think it is?

POLICE OFFICER	Well, there's only one thing to do.
TED	No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
POLICE OFFICER	Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.

TED	No! I was pissing!
POLICE OFFICER	Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.

RENISE	Hey.
TED	So what's up?
RENISE	Eh.
TED	Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.

TED	It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
RENISE	See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
TED	Uh-huh.
RENISE	Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.

TED	Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
RENISE	I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.

WARREN	Piggyback ride.
TED	I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.

TED	We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
WARREN	Giddy-up.

WARREN	Franks and beans!
TED	Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.

TED	How are you doing, Warren?
WARREN	Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
TED	I'm gonna take a rain check.

TED	See you, Warren.
WARREN	Huh...?

TED	See you, Warren.
WARREN	Bye, Ted.

EARL	Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
BURT	Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."

EARL	Or a big mother slug maybe?
BURT	Some kind of mutation...?

BURT	You guys all set?
EARL	Ready as we'll ever be.
BURT	Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.

BURT	You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
EARL	One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.

EARL	Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
BURT	No problem.
EARL	Good.  You've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  So, here's the plan: You and Heather go for help. Get to the mountains...

EARL	Yeah, like they got a plan...
BURT	Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
EARL	Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.

BURT	Yeah, still got one poking around.
EARL	That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
BURT	Roger that.

BURT	What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
EARL	You can't fight'em that way...
BURT	You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?

BURT	How much you think?
EARL	I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?

EARL	What the hell is that, anyway?
BURT	Cannon fuse.
EARL	What do <u>you</u> use it for?
BURT	My cannon.

BURT	Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
HEATHER	Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.

HEATHER	I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
BURT	Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?

HEATHER	You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
BURT	Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.

HEATHER	Knock it off, Burt!
BURT	I think I scared it!

BURT	What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
HEATHER	I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.

BURT	A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
VAL	We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!

BURT	What the hell you doing back already?
VAL	You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...

BURT	Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
VAL	Burt, can you hear me now?
BURT	Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.

VAL	Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
BURT	Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
VAL	Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
BURT	What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
VAL	Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!

VAL	Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
BURT	In a minute.

BURT	That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
VAL	Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!

VAL	Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BURT	Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?

BURT	She's got my vote.
VAL	Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.

VAL	BACK OFF, BURT...!
BURT	Well, who put you two in charge?

EARL	Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
RHONDA	Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
EARL	No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.

EARL	Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
RHONDA	I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
EARL	I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
RHONDA	Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.

EARL	Well, at least the bastard can't climb.  Pardon my French.
RHONDA	Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.

RHONDA	There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
EARL	I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.

RHONDA	I might have an idea...
EARL	We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
RHONDA	Well, I was wondering if we could...

EARL	I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
RHONDA	Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
EARL	You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.

EARL	You know, up the jeep trail.
RHONDA	The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.

RHONDA	Well, we can take my truck then.
EARL	No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.

RHONDA	Oh my God.
EARL	Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...

EARL	He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
RHONDA	VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!

RHONDA	We're not going over there, right?
EARL	No.  We go straight.

EARL	So...now what?
RHONDA	Could we make it to the mountains?

EARL	Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
RHONDA	Nope, there!  That's one.

RHONDA	Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
EARL	Howdy, Rhonda.
RHONDA	You're really leaving, huh?
EARL	You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
RHONDA	Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.

EARL	You didn't cook breakfast?
VAL	Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
EARL	No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
VAL	Hell you did.  Your turn.

VAL	How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
EARL	I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.

VAL	If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
EARL	I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
VAL	Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
EARL	Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.

VAL	Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
EARL	Has a lot of rain.

EARL	You're gonna get us hung up.
VAL	Do not talk to the driver.

EARL	Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
VAL	Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
EARL	Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?

VAL	Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
EARL	Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
VAL	The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!

EARL	You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
VAL	What the hell do we know about seismographs?
EARL	Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
VAL	Why?
EARL	Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
VAL	Well, sure.
EARL	...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...

VAL	Tammy Lynn Baxter.
EARL	Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
VAL	Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
EARL	I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.

EARL	Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
VAL	Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.

VAL	Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
EARL	You gotta ask <u>that</u>?

VAL	So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
EARL	We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
VAL	So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
EARL	Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
VAL	Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.

VAL	Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
EARL	Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!

VAL	What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
EARL	In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
VAL	I'll call that little bluff.  How close?

EARL	Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
VAL	Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.

EARL	She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
VAL	That's the plan.

EARL	We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
VAL	Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!

VAL	So long, cactus!
EARL	Adios, bridge!

VAL	Jeez, look at that guy.
EARL	One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
VAL	Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.

EARL	You're full of shit.
VAL	He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.

EARL	Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
VAL	If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
EARL	Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
VAL	Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
EARL	Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?

VAL	Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
EARL	You got that right.

VAL	Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
EARL	Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
VAL	I'll go with that plan.

EARL	Oh, Jesus!!
VAL	What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!

VAL	Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
EARL	Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.

VAL	Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
EARL	Val!  Val!

VAL	Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
EARL	You're hung up again.
VAL	I am not!

VAL	Fuck you!
EARL	Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!

EARL	It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
VAL	Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!

EARL	Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
VAL	Fifteen lousy bucks.
EARL	A man who plans ahead.

VAL	Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
EARL	Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
VAL	Screw you.  For all you know they could <u>fly</u>.

EARL	You want the rifle or the Smith?
VAL	The rifle.

EARL	That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
VAL	Great.  Thank you.

EARL	Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
VAL	Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?

EARL	Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
VAL	That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
EARL	<u>Why</u> would they do it?

EARL	Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
VAL	Oh shit!

EARL	What the hell are they?
VAL	Sons of bitches!

EARL	This is one big mother!
VAL	So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?

EARL	Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
VAL	Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them.  We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  We're really <u>in</u> on something here!

EARL	Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
VAL	You got <u>that</u> right!

EARL	Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
VAL	Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.

VAL	We'll take your word for it.
EARL	Yeah.  Where's your truck?

EARL	Prairie dog burrow...
VAL	Little sons of bitches.

VAL	God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
EARL	Okay, now, how far's your truck?

VAL	I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
EARL	I think we wait right here.

EARL	Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
VAL	Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
EARL	Fuck you, too.  Pardon my French.

VAL	Son of a bitch!
EARL	Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
VAL	It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...

EARL	You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
VAL	Me, too.

EARL	Well, folks, what's the plan?
VAL	First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.

EARL	Don't he have a home to go to?
VAL	Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.

EARL	Run for it?  Running's not a plan. Running is what you do when the plan fails.  You're not even trying to come up with a plan!
VAL	Well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...

EARL	You go north, I'll go south.
VAL	Right.

EARL	You're right, don't matter where they come from.
VAL	Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.

EARL	I'm gonna kick his ass!
VAL	I'm gonna help you.

EARL	Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
VAL	Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.

VAL	How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
EARL	Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
VAL	We need another plan.

EARL	Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
VAL	Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
EARL	Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.

VAL	But...we could pull something!  We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
EARL	A car, huh?  Like a big armored car?  Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
VAL	Its tires are flat...
EARL	Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
VAL	Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
EARL	We got a plan!

VAL	<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
EARL	Like hell you are.
VAL	Get real.  I'm faster than you.
EARL	<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
VAL	Only if something happens to me.

VAL	Watch your ass, shithead.
EARL	Don't worry about me, jerkoff.

VAL	Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
EARL	I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.

VAL	Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
EARL	Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.

EARL	Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
VAL	Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.

VAL	Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
EARL	Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...

VAL	They're...they're trying to make us move!
EARL	Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
VAL	It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.

EARL	Use the fucking bomb!
VAL	So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
EARL	I want to live for the three days.

EARL	What the hell are you doing?!!
VAL	I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!

EARL	Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
VAL	Not yet, not yet...

EARL	Road's in!
VAL	Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
EARL	<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
VAL	Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
EARL	Yeah...but no ties.
VAL	No ties.

EARL	Christ, Val, maybe she's not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
VAL	Civil?  I'm civil.
EARL	You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.

VAL	Somebody paying you to do this?
EARL	She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!

EARL	Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
VAL	What?
EARL	She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
VAL	You are so full of shit...
EARL	Oh yeah?  Think about this:  She ain't as narrow-minded as you. I'll lay odds she's looking for character in a man.  For my part, I'd be proud to have her.  I'd goddamn worship her.

OLD FRED	How's she doing?
EDGAR	She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.

OLD FRED	Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
EDGAR	Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
OLD FRED	Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
EDGAR	If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.

OLD FRED	We playing cards tonight?
EDGAR	I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
OLD FRED	I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
EDGAR	You bet.

HEATHER	Hi, guys, what you been up to?
VAL	Ran into the new college student, Rona.

HEATHER	Down, honey, down.
VAL	Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.

VAL	Burt!  Heather!
HEATHER	Yeah, Val.
VAL	We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.

HEATHER	We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
VAL	They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!

HEATHER	Val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...
VAL	Yeah, Heather, we got you.

JIM	I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
MEGAN	We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
JIM	The con...!  Oh my God.
MEGAN	Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
JIM	What?
MEGAN	That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
JIM	Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.

MEGAN	Well, what's wrong with it?
JIM	It's...gone...!

MEGAN	You sure this is where it was?
JIM	Am I sure?!  It was right there.  There's the cord.

MEGAN	Come on.  Get away from it!
JIM	God, what a stink!

PHAM VAN	Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
VAL	Could be.

PHAM VAN	And I appreciate it.
VAL	You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.

VAL	I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
PHAM VAN	I didn't do it!  What's going on?

VAL	Twenty.
PHAM VAN	Okay, ten dollars.

PHAM VAN	I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
VAL	Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!

RHONDA	Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
VAL	Yeah, geography.
RHONDA	Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.

RHONDA	Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
VAL	Around here?  Why would they?
RHONDA	Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
VAL	Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
RHONDA	Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.

RHONDA	Darn it!
VAL	You okay?
RHONDA	Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.

VAL	Think it's still following us?
RHONDA	Let's assume that it is.

RHONDA	Ready?
VAL	Yeah.  One, two, three...

VAL	Rhonda's got an idea about that.
RHONDA	Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.

VAL	You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
RHONDA	It does.

VAL	What's it doing?
RHONDA	Why do you all keep asking me?

RHONDA	Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
VAL	They're working together, too.

VAL	What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
RHONDA	You guys do all the odd jobs.

RHONDA	Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
VAL	Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!

RHONDA	Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
VAL	Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.

VAL	I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
RHONDA	Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
VAL	Good point.

RHONDA	It worked!  There they go!
VAL	LET'S DO IT!

CHOIR TEACHER	What the hell was that?
OZ	Sorry.
CHOIR TEACHER	No, it was good.
OZ	Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
CHOIR TEACHER	Well then keep it coming.  Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.

OZ	I'll do it.
CHOIR TEACHER	Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?

COACH MARSHALL	Good work, Ostreicher.
OZ	Thanks coach.
COACH MARSHALL	You're a killer, Ozzy!
OZ	-- Thanks, coach --

COACH MARSHALL	Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
OZ	Sorry, coach.
COACH MARSHALL	What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?

OZ	Great evening, isn't it?
COLLEGE CHICK	Sure.
OZ	There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.

COLLEGE CHICK	What did you just say?
OZ	Suck me...beautiful?

OZ	Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
COLLEGE CHICK	You need some work, buddy!

COLLEGE CHICK	Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
OZ	Like what?

COLLEGE CHICK	Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
OZ	...okay...
COLLEGE CHICK	You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
OZ	I'm not good in math.

FINCH	Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
JIM	Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
FINCH	This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.

FINCH	Good morning gentleman.
JIM	Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
FINCH	I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.

JIM	You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
FINCH	Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.

JIM	Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
FINCH	When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?

FINCH	Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
STIFLER'S MOM	As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
FINCH	I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
STIFLER'S MOM	I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
FINCH	Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
STIFLER'S MOM	Pardon me?

FINCH	...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
STIFLER'S MOM	I believe the kegs are upstairs.
FINCH	No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.

STIFLER'S MOM	All right, I got some scotch.
FINCH	Single malt?
STIFLER'S MOM	Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.

FINCH	So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
STIFLER'S MOM	Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
FINCH	Yes ma'am, I am.

STIFLER'S MOM	I had no idea you'd be this good!
FINCH	Neither did I!

KEVIN	This is your plan, Finch?
FINCH	Yep.

KEVIN	This.  Right now.
FINCH	Uh-huh.

KEVIN	Of course, Finch.  What?
FINCH	Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
KEVIN	What are we gonna hear?
FINCH	You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.

KEVIN	You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
FINCH	Seduce her.

FINCH	What do you suppose they're saying?
KEVIN	No idea.

KEVIN	Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
FINCH	Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
KEVIN	Just go!
FINCH	Why is this?
KEVIN	You're gonna shit your pants!
FINCH	Charming.
KEVIN	Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
FINCH	First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!

FINCH	Me too.  For the most part.
KEVIN	Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.

FINCH	I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
KEVIN	So Oz, you almost made it, huh?

HEATHER	Not bad, Chris.
OZ	Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
HEATHER	Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
OZ	Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
HEATHER	Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?

OZ	Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
HEATHER	Of course, I didn't --
OZ	I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
HEATHER	You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."

OZ	Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
HEATHER	Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
OZ	I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
HEATHER	Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.

OZ	Hey, what're you doing here?
HEATHER	Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."

HEATHER	Um...Chris --
OZ	You can call me Oz.
HEATHER	Do I have to?
OZ	You can call me Ostreicher.
HEATHER	What's your middle name?
OZ	Forget it.
HEATHER	Come on!  I won't tell.
OZ	Neither will I.
HEATHER	Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --

OZ	Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
HEATHER	Yeah, me too, okay, cool.

OZ	Nice car.
HEATHER	I'm glad you think so.
OZ	You don't like it?
HEATHER	No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.

OZ	What?!
HEATHER	Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
OZ	What?  No I'm not.
HEATHER	I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
OZ	I wasn't making fun of you.
HEATHER	Give me a break, you're so full of it.

HEATHER	Why are you doing this?
OZ	Because I want to.
HEATHER	Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.

HEATHER	Hi...
OZ	How did you know I was here?
HEATHER	Stifler told me.
OZ	You talked to Stifler?
HEATHER	Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
OZ	...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.

OZ	Uh...my dad's the manager.
HEATHER	Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
OZ	Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.

OZ	My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
HEATHER	That's nice.
OZ	So you're going to Michigan?
HEATHER	Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
OZ	Onions?
HEATHER	What?
OZ	You want onions?
HEATHER	Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
OZ	Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
HEATHER	Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
OZ	Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
HEATHER	Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
OZ	Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
HEATHER	Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
OZ	I know.  Salt and pepper?
HEATHER	Sure.

HEATHER	So we're gonna be close next year?
OZ	You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
HEATHER	...yeah.

OZ	...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
HEATHER	You can't sing at the competition.
OZ	I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
HEATHER	...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
OZ	Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  So I guess...I'll see you later.

HEATHER	What about the game?!
OZ	I'm not playing.
HEATHER	You're missing the game for us?!
OZ	No.  I'm missing the game for you.

OZ	There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
HEATHER	What's that?
OZ	It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.

HEATHER	This isn't the best way to proposition me.
OZ	No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
HEATHER	This isn't any better, Chris.
OZ	No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --

HEATHER	Oz, it's okay, I know.
OZ	You called me Oz.
HEATHER	Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.

HEATHER	Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
OZ	I know, it sucks!

OZ	I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
HEATHER	Then don't.

VICKY	Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
JESSICA	Yeah right.
VICKY	What?  We both have cars.
JESSICA	Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
VICKY	That's not why we're going out.
JESSICA	What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
VICKY	Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
JESSICA	Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
VICKY	Please.

VICKY	He likes it.
JESSICA	Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
VICKY	I think I've had one.
JESSICA	Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
VICKY	...I've never tried it.
JESSICA	Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?

VICKY	Jessica, can you drive me home?
JESSICA	Sure.

JESSICA	Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
KEVIN	What?
JESSICA	I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
KEVIN	You mean...and orgasm?
JESSICA	You got it, stud.
KEVIN	Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
JESSICA	No you haven't.
KEVIN	But that one time --
JESSICA	No.
KEVIN	Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
JESSICA	Do you?
KEVIN	Of course.
JESSICA	Do you love her?

KEVIN	I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
JESSICA	Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
KEVIN	I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
JESSICA	Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.

JESSICA	No comment.
KEVIN	No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
JESSICA	Thanks.  It was my idea.
KEVIN	Did you guys hook up or something?
JESSICA	Are you kidding?  No.
KEVIN	Then what the hell are you talking about?
JESSICA	Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
KEVIN	I don't get it, that really works?
JESSICA	Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK	Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
JIM	Yeah, I'm the best, baby.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK	Give it to me!  Yes!
JIM	Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK	Don't you love my sexy body?!
JIM	I do, baby, I do.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK	You're so big!
JIM	Yeah, that's right.

PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK	Fuck me!  Yes!
JIM	Uh...

JIM	And you said...
KEVIN	Nothing, I just hugged her back.
JIM	You think she was serious?
KEVIN	I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."

JIM	There's our man.
KEVIN	Finch, you got the Latin homework?

KEVIN	Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
JIM	No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.

KEVIN	Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
JIM	You can crash at Stifler's?
KEVIN	It's all good.  Breath check.

KEVIN	At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
JIM	So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?

JIM	What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
KEVIN	You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?

KEVIN	Gotta go.
JIM	But --

KEVIN	Ow, what the hell?
JIM	Sorry, I thought you were dead.

JIM	Like a bet?
KEVIN	No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.

KEVIN	That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
JIM	Pontificated.
KEVIN	Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
JIM	Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!

JIM	Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
KEVIN	Right.  That gives us...
JIM	Exactly three weeks to the day.

JIM	I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
KEVIN	No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
JIM	Yeah, enormous.

JIM	Hey, where's Finch?
KEVIN	Went home to shit.
JIM	I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?

KEVIN	You can send me the address too.
JIM	Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
KEVIN	I'll save you a seat.

JIM	Did I miss anything?!
KEVIN	Just in time.

JIM	But, but -- what would I do?
KEVIN	Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
JIM	That's stupid.
KEVIN	No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
JIM	Oh...oh...oh, shit!

JIM	Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
KEVIN	Come on, Jim.  Where are you?

JIM	Please, God.  Let this be it.
KEVIN	He's going in!

JIM	Holy shit.
KEVIN	Holy shit!

KEVIN	Hey, minuteman.
JIM	Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.

KEVIN	How do you know that?
JIM	She's already on a plane back home.

KEVIN	Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
JIM	Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.

JIM	Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
KEVIN	You fuckin' rule!

KEVIN	Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
JIM	My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
KEVIN	Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?

JIM	Back out?  You don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  You afraid or something?
KEVIN	No, but come on guys, we made a pact!

JIM	Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
KEVIN	I'm not going.

JIM	No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
KEVIN	Yeah.

JIM'S DAD	What the heck is this?
JIM	Nothing!

JIM'S DAD	Can I come in?
JIM	Yeah, sure.
JIM'S DAD	You're not...busy?
JIM	Dad, come in.

JIM	Okay.
JIM'S DAD	These are for you.  From father to son.

JIM	I know, Dad.
JIM'S DAD	Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.

JIM	Dad!  I know!
JIM'S DAD	Do you know about the clitoris?
JIM	Yes dad.
JIM'S DAD	Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
JIM	Thank you, dad, I got it.
JIM'S DAD	Okay, well that about covers it.

JIM'S DAD	Jim?
JIM	It's not what it looks like!

JIM	Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
JIM'S DAD	Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
JIM	Yes.
JIM'S DAD	That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.

JIM'S DAD	Son.  This lady's here for you.
JIM	I know.  Hey Nadia.

JIM	Dad.
JIM'S DAD	Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
JIM	Dad!!
JIM'S DAD	Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.

JIM	Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
MICHELLE	Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
JIM	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
MICHELLE	I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
JIM	What was your name again?
MICHELLE	Michelle.
JIM	Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
MICHELLE	Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
JIM	Yes.  Seriously.
MICHELLE	Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
JIM	Whatever you want.
MICHELLE	Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...

MICHELLE	You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
JIM	Highly, highly overrated.

JIM	Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
MICHELLE	It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
JIM	Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
MICHELLE	Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
JIM	Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...

MICHELLE	That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
JIM	I told you.
MICHELLE	You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.

JIM	Yeah, bring it on!
MICHELLE	Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...

JIM	So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
MICHELLE	Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
JIM	Okay, I get it.
MICHELLE	Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.

JIM	...excuse me?!
MICHELLE	What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!

JIM	This'll do.
MICHELLE	Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
JIM	Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
MICHELLE	Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!

JIM	Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
MICHELLE	Don't you want me to?
JIM	Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
MICHELLE	Okay!

OZ	Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
JIM	Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
OZ	She's a mermaid, dude.
JIM	Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
OZ	She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
JIM	A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
OZ	Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
JIM	C-Span?

OZ	You guys got the Latin homework?
JIM	No -- Kevin, you?

JIM	Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
OZ	Fun loving -- insane.

JIM	This was remade?  Into what?
OZ	Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...

OZ	Who cares?
JIM	Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?

OZ	Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
JIM	So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?

OZ	Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
JIM	Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?

JIM	Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
OZ	Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.

OZ	Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
JIM	Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.

OZ	You can do that?
JIM	Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.

OZ	You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
JIM	No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.

OZ	I still think you're okay.
JIM	So do I, Kev.

JIM	There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
OZ	Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.

OZ	I'll just say that we had a great night together.
JIM	Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
OZ	I know.

OZ	It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
JIM	After getting laid?
OZ	After high school.

SHERMAN	What's up, fellas?
JIM	Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
SHERMAN	Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
JIM	You've got something going?
SHERMAN	Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?

JIM	You did it.
SHERMAN	Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.

JIM	Yes.
NADIA	I thought so.

JIM	No...you...go...ahead.
NADIA	Okay.

NADIA	You are very good in the world history class, yes?
JIM	Me?

JIM	Yes.  No.  Yes.
NADIA	Perhaps you can help me with my studies?

JIM	Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
NADIA	Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
JIM	I suppose that would be okay.

JIM	So you need to change, right?
NADIA	Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.

NADIA	James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
JIM	Well...uh...
NADIA	Shame on you!
JIM	Uh...yeah...sorry.
NADIA	Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
JIM	Strip?
NADIA	Yes, slowly.

JIM	You mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
NADIA	For me?

JIM	Uh...
NADIA	Move with the music.
JIM	Um...okay...

NADIA	No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
JIM	Nadia, I can't --
NADIA	Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.

NADIA	Jim...
JIM	Oh no.

NADIA	You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
JIM	No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.

JIM	Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
NADIA	Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
JIM	Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.

JIM	No, not again.
NADIA	I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
JIM	No!  I've got...reserve reserves!

KEVIN	Stifler, you're such an asshole.
STIFLER	Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.

STIFLER	SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
KEVIN	God dammit, Stifler!
STIFLER	Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.

KEVIN	Ho-lee shit.
STIFLER	This just got a hell of a lot better.

STIFLER	Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
KEVIN	Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
STIFLER	Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.

KEVIN	It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
VICKY	You think so?

KEVIN	Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are.
VICKY	Kevin, this is serious!
KEVIN	You got in.

VICKY	Oh, Kev.
KEVIN	Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
VICKY	Tonight?
KEVIN	Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?

VICKY	Let me know.
KEVIN	Okay, don't stop.

KEVIN	Vicky, wait.
VICKY	Not for you.

KEVIN	I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
VICKY	I think "shithead" really says it.
KEVIN	Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!

KEVIN	And I want to try to make it up to you.
VICKY	How?

VICKY	Oh...ungghhhhh!
KEVIN	Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.

VICKY	Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
KEVIN	Just a second!

KEVIN	You're not doing the extra credit problems.
VICKY	No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
KEVIN	That's my trick!
VICKY	It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.

KEVIN	We've come a long way since Homecoming.
VICKY	Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
KEVIN	Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.

VICKY	Like how?
KEVIN	Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
VICKY	I think you're so right, Kevin.
KEVIN	You want to do it?
VICKY	Yes --

VICKY	Kevin?  Do you not love me?
KEVIN	No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
VICKY	But you don't love me.
KEVIN	I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."

VICKY	Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
KEVIN	I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
VICKY	Okay.

KEVIN	Hey...
VICKY	Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
KEVIN	It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.

KEVIN	About the other day...I've been thinking.
VICKY	So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.

VICKY	And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
KEVIN	Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
VICKY	Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.

KEVIN	Now?!
VICKY	No...I know the perfect time...

KEVIN	See -- this is the nicest room.
VICKY	Wow, Kev...it's perfect.

KEVIN	You comfortable?
VICKY	Yeah, are you?
KEVIN	Yeah.

VICKY	You sure you're comfortable?
KEVIN	Yeah.  Are you sure?
VICKY	Yeah.
KEVIN	Me too.
VICKY	Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
KEVIN	Yeah, right here.

KEVIN	So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
VICKY	I don't know.  How do you?
KEVIN	Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
VICKY	Okay.

KEVIN	Yeah Vick?
VICKY	I want to hear you say it.
KEVIN	Okay.

KEVIN	Victoria...I love you.
VICKY	I love you.

KEVIN	That was a great night.
VICKY	Yeah.

KEVIN	I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
VICKY	Yeah, the time went by so fast.
KEVIN	It did.

VICKY	Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
KEVIN	Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
VICKY	No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.

KEVIN	Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
VICKY	I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
KEVIN	What?
VICKY	Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!

KEVIN'S BROTHER	You called me to ask me how to get laid?
KEVIN	What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
KEVIN'S BROTHER	Just dial 976-Asshole.
KEVIN	Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
KEVIN'S BROTHER	Have you ever heard of the bible?
KEVIN	What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
KEVIN'S BROTHER	Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
KEVIN	Does it tell me how to get laid?
KEVIN'S BROTHER	You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
KEVIN	Ready for what?
KEVIN'S BROTHER	Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.

KEVIN'S BROTHER	Say that again, Kevin?
KEVIN	Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...

KEVIN'S BROTHER	Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
KEVIN	What?!  How do I do that?
KEVIN'S BROTHER	Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
KEVIN	Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
KEVIN'S BROTHER	That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
KEVIN	Qualify for what?
KEVIN'S BROTHER	You've just inherited The Bible.

KEVIN	Hey.  I got another question for you.
KEVIN'S BROTHER	What's that?

KEVIN	Then she said -- she loves me.
OZ	Oh shit dude, the L-word!

KEVIN	You ever hear of something called The Bible?
OZ	Once, in church, dude.

OZ	Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
KEVIN	You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?

OZ	And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
KEVIN	How the hell do you know all these random songs?
OZ	It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.

OZ	Contact, dude.
KEVIN	Then where does a blowjob figure in?

KEVIN	Feeling better, Oz?
OZ	I'm such a loser.
KEVIN	That's the spirit.

KEVIN	I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
OZ	No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?

OZ	Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
KEVIN	This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.

OZ	The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
KEVIN	Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --

KEVIN	So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
OZ	Dude, prom sucks.
KEVIN	I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.

OZ	So does your tongue cramp up?
KEVIN	Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.

OZ	What reputation?
KEVIN	Observe.

OZ	Okay, explain.
KEVIN	I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.

OZ	Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
KEVIN	Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!

OZ	Kevin, it was just a --
KEVIN	<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --

OZ	...Guess what?
KEVIN	I don't care.

OZ	And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
KEVIN	He didn't?

KEVIN	I guess we'll call you two-ply.
OZ	Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?

KEVIN	Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
OZ	I think we're falling in love.

KEVIN	Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
OZ	Fuck yeah we will.

STIFLER	NOVA!!
OZ	Stifler!!

STIFLER	You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
OZ	Depends if my date wants to stop by.
STIFLER	That junior chick?
OZ	Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
STIFLER	Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
OZ	Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
STIFLER	Bullshit.  From where?
OZ	She works part-time at my dad's store.
STIFLER	Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
OZ	Dude, he does not.

STIFLER	You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
OZ	Shut the fuck up.

STIFLER	I think you need your balls reattached.
OZ	Keep it down, dude.
STIFLER	What the fuck are you doing here?
OZ	This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.

STIFLER	You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
OZ	Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.

OZ	<u>Yeah</u>!
STIFLER	Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
OZ	Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.

OZ	Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
STIFLER	I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?

STIFLER	Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
OZ	Come on, you know the words, sing along.
STIFLER	No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.

OZ	Our last game is this Saturday.
STIFLER	No shit.

SOPHOMORE CHICK	God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
STIFLER	Yep.

STIFLER	Here, babe.
SOPHOMORE CHICK	Thanks.

SOPHOMORE CHICK	Really?
STIFLER	Uh huh.

SOPHOMORE CHICK	I don't know if I want to be doing this.
STIFLER	Doing what?

SOPHOMORE CHICK	You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
STIFLER	No way.

RYAN	How long have you worked for the Therrians?
AMERICA	A long time.
RYAN	So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
AMERICA	Oh yes.
RYAN	Did you know the contractor?
AMERICA	Very well.
RYAN	Was it a contractor?
AMERICA	It's the way they do things.
RYAN	To code?

RYAN	Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
AMERICA	You should talk to Mr. Joe.

ASTRID	So who won?
SALLY	A triumph.  When did you get here?
ASTRID	Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
SALLY	Why didn't you come in?
ASTRID	I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.

ASTRID	You're not upset that I brought the dog?
SALLY	Would it make a difference?
ASTRID	Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
SALLY	You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
ASTRID	Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
SALLY	You're fucking desperate.
ASTRID	Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
SALLY	One guess.

JOE	Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
CAL	Absolutely.
JOE	Had a little help?
CAL	Absolutely not.
JOE	It has your ring.
CAL	I'm not that good.

CAL	What's that?
JOE	The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?

JOE	Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
CAL	Why last?

CAL	It's going.  It's going.
JOE	And how's the diva doing?

JOE	Isn't Skye amazing?
CAL	She's got great tits.
JOE	She's a constant surprise.
CAL	And you've only just met.
JOE	Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
CAL	Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
JOE	Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
CAL	The camera loves her.  A great actress.
JOE	With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.

CAL	Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
JOE	No, what?
CAL	The movie.
JOE	Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
CAL	I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
JOE	Who, Sally?
CAL	And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
JOE	I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
CAL	Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
JOE	What?
CAL	Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
JOE	Leo?
CAL	Any thoughts on casting yet?
JOE	Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
CAL	Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
JOE	October-ish.
CAL	I have a small window of time.
JOE	Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
CAL	Scratch the two, write in a four.
JOE	Scratch the two, write in a four.
CAL	You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
JOE	Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?

MAC	She already has.
CLAIR	It's alright, isn't it?

CLAIR	So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
MAC	It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.

CLAIR	Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
MAC	I'm in mourning.
CLAIR	You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
MAC	Not this time.
CLAIR	It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.

MAC	You don't have any clothes on.
CLAIR	How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
MAC	Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
CLAIR	Things always look much worse in the morning.
MAC	I don't know how to make her funny.
CLAIR	You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
MAC	What what's about?
CLAIR	I...wait, what are you talking about?

CLAIR	Honey?
MAC	I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.

CLAIR	What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
SALLY	Of course.

CLAIR	I'm not.
SALLY	This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.

SALLY	Why didn't you bring him?
CLAIR	What?
SALLY	Why didn't you bring him?
CLAIR	He's allergic.
SALLY	Oh.
CLAIR	To dander.  Otis.
SALLY	Oh.
CLAIR	Didn't I say?
SALLY	Well, probably.
CLAIR	They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
SALLY	Oh.

CLAIR	It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
SALLY	Borrow whatever you like.
CLAIR	I'll change back before we leave.
SALLY	Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
CLAIR	I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
SALLY	I'd say it was down.
CLAIR	And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
SALLY	You want a Tylenol, or something?
CLAIR	I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
SALLY	Why would she care?
CLAIR	You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
SALLY	You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
CLAIR	Just don't fucking tell her.
SALLY	It's not going to come up.

SALLY	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
CLAIR	My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.

SOPHIA	You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
CLAIR	You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
SOPHIA	I'm glad that's all over for me.
CLAIR	Don't you miss it?
SOPHIA	Never.
CLAIR	Really.
SOPHIA	Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
CLAIR	Really?
SOPHIA	So where is young Jonah?
CLAIR	With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.

SOPHIA	What is that thing?
CLAIR	So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
SOPHIA	You should have brought him.
CLAIR	Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
SOPHIA	Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
CLAIR	Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
SOPHIA	Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
CLAIR	I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.

SOPHIA	Let's get the kids.
CLAIR	Oh my God, the sitter.

SALLY	Thanks for coming.
GINA	Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?

SALLY	Would you leave us alone right now?
GINA	I love her too, Joe.

GINA	He's gonna miss his flight.
SALLY	Yeah.

GINA	Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
SALLY	He's not going tonight.
GINA	I told his father he'd be on that flight.
SALLY	Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
GINA	Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
SALLY	And you're not the wife.
GINA	It's not a contest.
SALLY	Damn straight.

GINA	Take good care of it.
SALLY	Count on it.

GINA	I'm the hired help.
JOE	Fuck you.
GINA	I never put myself in harm's way.
JOE	Anymore.
GINA	No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.

JOE	That for us?
GINA	What a nose.  You missed your calling.
JOE	Can I open it?
GINA	Sally?
JOE	Please?

GINA	Directing suits you.
JOE	I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
GINA	It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
JOE	Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
GINA	Just did.  Jealous?
JOE	When does he graduate high school?
GINA	Oh, very jealous.

GINA	I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
JOE	Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
GINA	In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
JOE	I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
GINA	Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
JOE	You really need to be fucked.

GINA	Escape hatch.
JOE	Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...

JOE	So?
GINA	I love you, Joe Therrian.

JOE	What is it?
GINA	Let's go upstairs, okay?

JOE	The suspense is killing me.
GINA	Harry called.
JOE	And?
GINA	Lucy overdosed.
JOE	But she's alright.
GINA	She's in ICU.

JOE	Stupid tart.
GINA	She left a note.
JOE	Fuck you.

GINA	You need to call your dad.
JOE	Leave us alone right now.
GINA	I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.

JEFFREY	Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
MONICA	Monica.
JEFFREY	And you know our friends, how?
MONICA	We live next door.
JEFFREY	Oh.  You're them.
MONICA	Excuse me?
JEFFREY	We've heard lots about you.
MONICA	You have?

JUDY	I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
JERRY	You have to sign your taxes anyway.

JERRY	Cal, my wife Judy.
JUDY	Nice to meet you.

JERRY	Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
JUDY	Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
JERRY	Well it's fucking time.

JUDY	There's a test, you know.
JERRY	Forget it, Judy.

JUDY	Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
JERRY	You're crazy baby.  I love you.
JUDY	Are you my big hard hero?
JERRY	Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
JUDY	Oh yeah...
JERRY	Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
JUDY	Oh yeah?
JERRY	Let me heal you, baby.
JUDY	Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.

JERRY	I call that a perfect day.
JUDY	A perfect night.
JERRY	Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
JUDY	Hm.  We should do it again.
JERRY	Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
JUDY	Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
JERRY	Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
JUDY	Not as a rule.
JERRY	They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!

MAC	Go.
JERRY	Hey!  Would you?
MAC	It was fifteen seconds.
JERRY	I don't think so.
MAC	Are you always this much fun?

JERRY	He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
MAC	Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.

MAC	I'm fine, babe.
JERRY	Give him a minute, Clair.
MAC	Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
JERRY	Anytime, sport.
MAC	Yeah, thanks pal.

MAC	I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
JERRY	Probably not.
MAC	So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?

JERRY	We closed.
SALLY	Fantastic.  Out here.

JERRY	Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
SALLY	I love you, you're a genius.

JERRY	I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
SALLY	I adore him.
JERRY	The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
SALLY	I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
JERRY	What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
SALLY	We've only been over this how many times?
JERRY	You only made half your quote this year.
SALLY	Well, you're a tower of support.
JERRY	I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
SALLY	We couldn't be on more solid ground.
JERRY	Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.

JERRY	Not millions.
SALLY	He's directing now.
JERRY	They're paying him scale.

SALLY	He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
JERRY	There's still time to undo this.
SALLY	We'll be fine.
JERRY	Did you invite them?
SALLY	The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
JERRY	That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
SALLY	Whatever you say.
JERRY	Did you tell Joe to behave?
SALLY	Yes.
JERRY	Did he promise?
SALLY	Scout's honor.
JERRY	Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.

SALLY	You're out of your mind.
JERRY	Just do what I say, alright?
SALLY	How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
JERRY	Beats a lawsuit.

SALLY	Take your time, Jer.
JERRY	I'm ready.

JERRY	What was it?  What the fuck was it?
SALLY	Ryan's novel.
JERRY	Ryan's novel?

SALLY	No luck.
JOE	Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?

SALLY	Happy anniversary, baby.
JOE	Happy anniversary.

JOE	I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
SALLY	Hardly...
JOE	Accept a compliment.
SALLY	I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.

JOE	What did you get me?
SALLY	In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.

JOE	Kiss the back of my knees.
SALLY	Through the sweats or not?
JOE	Not.

SALLY	What?
JOE	You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?

SALLY	No.  Did you?
JOE	No.  I missed that.
SALLY	I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
JOE	We're great.
SALLY	I mean, you're really back.
JOE	For good.

JOE	Don't get it.
SALLY	Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
JOE	What?
SALLY	They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
JOE	Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
SALLY	You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
JOE	She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
SALLY	No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
JOE	You want me to uninvite her?
SALLY	No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?

SALLY	And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
JOE	Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.

JOE	I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
SALLY	I'm going to throw up.
JOE	I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
SALLY	Really?

SALLY	Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
JOE	I'll say as little as possible.

SALLY	Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
JOE	You can never be too early or too thin.

JOE	Otis!  No barking!
SALLY	And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.

SALLY	In the kitchen.
JOE	Who'd like to go and find Otis?

SALLY	Yes.
JOE	Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.

SALLY	Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
JOE	It's taken care of.

JOE	Two minutes.
SALLY	It's alright.  Be our guests.

SALLY	Still champions.
JOE	Panes is not on your team anymore.

JOE	It's an unfair advantage.
SALLY	You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
JOE	Okay, knock it off.
SALLY	Truce?
JOE	Truce.
SALLY	Dinner.  Don't be angry.
JOE	I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.

SALLY	Not properly watered.
JOE	Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...

JOE	Dolphins.  Great.
SALLY	It's ecstasy, Sal.

JOE	I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
SALLY	I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.

SALLY	Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
JOE	Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.

SALLY	Don't be so sure.
JOE	Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
SALLY	She left the fucking gate open.
JOE	Well he can't have gone far.
SALLY	Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
JOE	He'll find his way back.
SALLY	There are fucking coyotes out there.
JOE	Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.

SALLY	Fuck you.
JOE	Or shitty!!  Otis!!

SALLY	Otis!!!!
JOE	Otis!!!!
SALLY	Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
JOE	This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
SALLY	It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
JOE	Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
SALLY	Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
JOE	Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
SALLY	Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
JOE	Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
SALLY	What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
JOE	Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
SALLY	Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
JOE	Otis!
SALLY	I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
JOE	Love?
SALLY	You walked out on a five year marriage.
JOE	That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
SALLY	It's not like this all the time.
JOE	DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
SALLY	And how hard it hit?
JOE	Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
SALLY	You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
JOE	Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
SALLY	You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
JOE	That is not true.
SALLY	It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
JOE	Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
SALLY	Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?

SALLY	And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
JOE	It's a novel.
SALLY	About me!
JOE	Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
SALLY	What are you saying?
JOE	Hello?  Last birthday was?
SALLY	I don't look my age, Joe.
JOE	Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
SALLY	It's a shit novel anyway.
JOE	Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
SALLY	Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
JOE	Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
SALLY	Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
JOE	Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
SALLY	Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?

SALLY	Cal, too?
JOE	Sally, for Christ's sake.
SALLY	Anyone else?
JOE	This is insanity.  Sally...
SALLY	Don't.
JOE	Don't push me away.
SALLY	I had an abortion two weeks ago.
JOE	Don't do this.
SALLY	I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
JOE	Don't do this!
SALLY	I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
JOE	You changed your mind.
SALLY	I wanted you back.

SALLY	You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
JOE	What?!  You aborted our child?!
SALLY	I'm a monster.  Exactly.
JOE	You're not ready.
SALLY	Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
JOE	I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
SALLY	Yes.
JOE	I'll never forgive you.
SALLY	I know.
JOE	I have no idea who you are.

JOE	Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
SALLY	Everybody hates the messenger.

JOE	I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
SALLY	I'll be with you.
JOE	I don't want to go tonight.
SALLY	You don't have to.

JOE	No.
SALLY	Okay.
JOE	Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
SALLY	I guess.
JOE	Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
SALLY	Me too.
JOE	That's under lock and key.
SALLY	Me too.

JOE	Happy anniversary.
SALLY	It's a Calder.
JOE	I know.
SALLY	He's my favorite.
JOE	I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
SALLY	Ah...

SALLY	They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
JOE	Oh, Sally Mae...

SALLY	I know.
JOE	Will you make love with me?
SALLY	Sure.

JOE	Panes!  How are you?
PANES	Oh, you know, I am.
JOE	Has she called?
PANES	She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?

PANES	What's a sign for that?
JOE	Come on, Panes...

PANES	Coffee?
JOE	Sure.
PANES	I'll do it.

JUDY	We have a gift?
JOE	Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
JUDY	Lovely.

JOE	I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
JUDY	Nothing that can't be exchanged.
JOE	Oh.  Well.  Good.
JUDY	Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
JOE	The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
JUDY	Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
JOE	Yes, she is.
JUDY	But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
JOE	It's a novel.
JUDY	Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
JOE	Yes.
JUDY	I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
JOE	No.
JUDY	It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
JOE	Yes I did.
JUDY	Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
JOE	Don't I find what?
JUDY	I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
JOE	Not long.
JUDY	Don't be silly.
JOE	Joking.
JUDY	Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
JOE	Do I put you off?
JUDY	You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
JOE	And I you.
JUDY	But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
JOE	Ah.
JUDY	And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
JOE	Mmm hmmm.

JUDY	The infamous dog?
JOE	He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
JUDY	Ours.
JOE	It's Jerry's worst idea.

MAC	You lose this?
JOE	Ah there's our snookums now.

MAC	You got your DP?
JOE	What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
MAC	And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
JOE	Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
MAC	Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
JOE	Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
MAC	Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
JOE	God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?

MAC	Well, you know...good days, bad days.
JOE	I meant Sally.
MAC	I meant Sally.
JOE	Oh.  You're serious.
MAC	No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
JOE	Oh don't.  Everyone says that.

MONICA	Please, Ryan.
JOE	No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?

MONICA	Something soft.
JOE	Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?

MONICA	Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
JOE	You're an interior decorator, right?
MONICA	Sally did all this herself?
JOE	In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
MONICA	Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
JOE	Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
MONICA	Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
JOE	Uh-huh.
MONICA	I'm a little nervous, so...
JOE	Oh.
MONICA	A little out of my element.
JOE	No you're not.
MONICA	Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
JOE	Hm.
MONICA	I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
JOE	Very well put.
MONICA	I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
JOE	What?
MONICA	But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
JOE	Elitism?
MONICA	The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
JOE	And you know, he really does not.
MONICA	And Ryan works at home.
JOE	And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.

JOE	Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
MONICA	Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
JOE	Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis.

JOE	Easy tiger.
MONICA	Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
JOE	Scout's honor.
MONICA	I'll be your best friend.

MONICA	Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
JOE	We're way past inappropriate.

JOE	I need to leave you now.
MONICA	I will treasure this.
JOE	Sally!!!!

JOE	Are you okay?
MONICA	I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
JOE	Let's go for a walk.

MONICA	I've never done this before.
JOE	Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl.
MONICA	I'm a little in the puke zone.
JOE	Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
MONICA	What am I, five?
JOE	You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
MONICA	Okay.

JOE	Lemon or raspberry?
MONICA	Lemon.
JOE	Lemon it is.

MONICA	Ryan's really angry with me.
JOE	I think he's really angry with me too.
MONICA	It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
JOE	I'm sorry.
MONICA	Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
JOE	That's a lot of those.
MONICA	Medallions.
JOE	A lot of cakes.
MONICA	Yes.
JOE	And he doesn't smoke?
MONICA	He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
JOE	How long have you been married?
MONICA	Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
JOE	You must have been a baby.
MONICA	Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
JOE	Come here.

MONICA	That's very nice.
JOE	I like you.
MONICA	I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
JOE	Sorry?
MONICA	I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
JOE	Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
MONICA	I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.

JOE	Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
MONICA	I'm so sorry.
JOE	It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis.

JOE	How do you do, Skye?
SKYE	Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
JOE	Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
SKYE	When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
JOE	I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
SKYE	You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.

SKYE	I think there are sixteen there.
JOE	This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.

SALLY	Of course it's alright.
MAC	Clair is a hovering mother.

MAC	What?
SALLY	Trust him.

SALLY	I didn't say a word.
MAC	Time!

SALLY	I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
MAC	No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.

MAC	Jesus Christ.
SALLY	Well...wow...

MAC	How's he doing?
SALLY	Not good.

MONICA	Ryan.
RYAN	I'm sure you understand.

RYAN	Well, yes, actually.
MONICA	He always has two or three going...

MONICA	I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
RYAN	You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
MONICA	Do you want to go home, Ryan?
RYAN	Yes.
MONICA	I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
RYAN	I'm not going to leave you alone.
MONICA	They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
RYAN	They're nothing like us.
MONICA	I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...

RYAN	Are you making an ass of yourself?
MONICA	There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
RYAN	I don't need a drug.
MONICA	You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.

RYAN	Ready to go?
MONICA	I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  Ryan, you're a great man.

MONICA	Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
RYAN	You're not serious.
MONICA	I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
RYAN	God willing.
MONICA	We have to find the dog, Ryan.
RYAN	Why?
MONICA	Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
RYAN	Excuse me?
MONICA	All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.

RYAN	Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
MONICA	Don't go in, Ryan.
RYAN	What?
MONICA	Let's just go home, okay?

SALLY	Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
MONICA	Sally?
SALLY	Yes.  And you've met Joe.

MONICA	We could hardly say no.
SALLY	Oh?

MONICA	Ryan!
SALLY	Are you working on a new book?

SALLY	Hors d'oeuvres or something?
MONICA	Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
SALLY	Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
MONICA	Yes.
SALLY	I so wish I'd known.
MONICA	Well, whoever did this is amazing.
SALLY	I did it.

MONICA	I'm sorry.
SALLY	There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
MONICA	I'm so sorry.
SALLY	You fucking cow, can't you read?!
MONICA	I...
SALLY	How long ago was it?

PANES	Come on in.
SKYE	I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.

SKYE	And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
PANES	Not at all.
SKYE	Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
PANES	No, never.

PANES	Is there space here?
SKYE	Yes.
PANES	Do you need anything else?
SKYE	No, no thanks.

PANES	I was impressed.
SKYE	Oh?
PANES	The charades.
SKYE	Thank you.
PANES	That was my clue.
SKYE	Oh?
PANES	The Shostakovich.
SKYE	Really??
PANES	Oh yes, indeed.  That was my clue, you see.

PANES	Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
SKYE	Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
PANES	Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
SKYE	Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
PANES	I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
SKYE	Do Peter Sellers again.
PANES	Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
SKYE	I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
PANES	Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
SKYE	Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
PANES	Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
SKYE	Yeah.
PANES	Would you, like, marry him?
SKYE	If he were still alive, maybe.
PANES	How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
SKYE	Are you asking me to marry you?
PANES	No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
SKYE	Very.
PANES	Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
SKYE	Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.

SALLY	Good, you brought your violin.  I want you to play.
PANES	It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
SALLY	Are you lovesick?
PANES	Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
SALLY	Will champagne help?
PANES	Not enough.

SALLY	Panes is here!
PANES	Oh great.

PANES	She's even better looking in the flesh.
SALLY	Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.

SALLY	Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
PANES	You don't know she's a bitch.
SALLY	She's all over him, are you blind?
PANES	It could be worse.
SALLY	How?
PANES	She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
SALLY	Fuck you, Panes.
PANES	You see, that's worse.
SALLY	I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
PANES	Like your business managers?
SALLY	They're not just our business managers, Panes.
PANES	Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
SALLY	Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
PANES	It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
SALLY	I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
PANES	How are you really doing, Panes? "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
SALLY	Like the last time.
PANES	No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
SALLY	Like the last time.
PANES	I wasn't finished.
SALLY	Okay.
PANES	We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while? "I'd love to, thanks."
SALLY	It's our anniversary, Panes.
PANES	I didn't hear me say tonight.
SALLY	We're just feeling our way back.
PANES	Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here.
SALLY	You know it's true.

SALLY	Everyday.
PANES	I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.

SALLY	Shit!
PANES	I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
SALLY	Shit.  It's my Galiano.
PANES	What does that mean?
SALLY	About five thousand dollars.  With my discount.

SALLY	So how are you really doing, Panes?
PANES	Why don't you go fuck yourself?
SALLY	No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
PANES	I'm worried about your Galiano.
SALLY	You're a shit.
PANES	No, really, five thousand with your discount.

PANES	How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
SALLY	Yes.  Fine.
PANES	That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
SALLY	I don't want to talk about it.
PANES	Why not?
SALLY	I never like to talk about my work.
PANES	Alright.  Well, that's something new.
SALLY	No.  Not something new.
PANES	Well, something's wrong.
SALLY	Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
PANES	Um.  Happy for you.
SALLY	Thanks.
PANES	So tell me, how's it going?
SALLY	Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
PANES	You're my best friend.
SALLY	That's not an answer, is it?
PANES	Yes, you're a monster.

SALLY	Thank you, Panes.
PANES	You don't need to thank me.
SALLY	We're going to have to go back out there.
PANES	I guess.

SALLY	Panes?
PANES	From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...

PANES	What did I do?
SALLY	Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.

RYAN	Yes.
SALLY	Well, so glad you decided to come.

SALLY	Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
RYAN	At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
SALLY	You're keeping a record, are you?
RYAN	It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.

SALLY	Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
RYAN	Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.

SALLY	Monica and Ryan.
RYAN	Rose.

RYAN	I didn't know you had this.
SALLY	Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
RYAN	Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?

SKYE	Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
SALLY	I'll be right out.

SALLY	I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
SKYE	Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.

SKYE	Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
SALLY	What are they?

SALLY	You don't need to do that.
SKYE	I don't mind...
SALLY	Relax.  You've done enough.

SALLY	Enough about me.
SOPHIA	Evie has a little something for you.

SOPHIA	Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
SALLY	And here they are!
SOPHIA	And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.

SALLY	He's a novelist.
SOPHIA	Ah.
SALLY	Like Joe.
SOPHIA	Hmm.  Where are my kids?
SALLY	In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
SOPHIA	I hope they're watercolors!
SALLY	Nevermind.
SOPHIA	Would you like to meet my husband?

SALLY	Isn't this a fabulous picture?
SOPHIA	Yes.
SALLY	She's such a great photographer.
SOPHIA	Hm.
SALLY	So where should I put it?
SOPHIA	I thought it was okay where it was.
SALLY	It's much more personal in here.
SOPHIA	A notch above the storage room.
SALLY	We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
SOPHIA	The both of you.
SALLY	But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
SOPHIA	So how much do you hate her?
SALLY	Big time.

SOPHIA	Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
SALLY	She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
SOPHIA	I trust you.
SALLY	Oh Soph...
SOPHIA	You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
SALLY	And the food sucks, I know.
SOPHIA	You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
SALLY	Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
SOPHIA	Well good.  Thank God.
SALLY	Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
SOPHIA	Oh honey, let's.

SALLY	What do you mean, thank God?
SOPHIA	Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
SALLY	No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
SOPHIA	Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
SALLY	Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
SOPHIA	He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
SALLY	Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.

SOPHIA	Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
SALLY	And Cal's this massive adult?
SOPHIA	Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
SALLY	You weren't exactly horrified.
SOPHIA	I don't have a drug problem.
SALLY	Neither does Joe.
SOPHIA	His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article.

SOPHIA	You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
SALLY	We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
SOPHIA	Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
SALLY	Not nice.  Not kind.
SOPHIA	Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
SALLY	Why are you doing this?
SOPHIA	His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
SALLY	But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
SOPHIA	No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.

Z	Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
AZTECA	Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
Z	The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
AZTECA	No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Z	Thank goodness.  Breaktime.

AZTECA	Break's over.
Z	This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
AZTECA	Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.

AZTECA	Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
WEAVER	I'm new...I was born yesterday.
AZTECA	Tell me about it.
WEAVER	Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
AZTECA	Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...

AZTECA	I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
WEAVER	Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
AZTECA	Are you asking me out to dinner?
WEAVER	No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
AZTECA	I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.

AZTECA	Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
WEAVER	Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!

WEAVER	You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
AZTECA	That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!

WEAVER	Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
AZTECA	Invisible!
WEAVER	No -- an <u>individual</u>!

AZTECA	Someone who follows his heart!
WEAVER	Right...because every ant's important!

BALA	General -- we have to talk sometime!
FORMICA	Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?

BALA	So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
FORMICA	Well...  I declared war!
BALA	Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...

BALA	He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
FORMICA	It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
BALA	Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
FORMICA	You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
BALA	Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.

Z	What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
BALA	Wanna dance?

Z	So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
BALA	I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Z	The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
BALA	<u>What</u>?

BALA	Are you sure this is a real dance?
Z	Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
BALA	Really?
Z	Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
BALA	You're right!
Z	You -- you think I'm right?
BALA	Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!

BALA	You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Z	Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
BALA	Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?

BALA	Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
Z	Wait!  When can I see you again?
BALA	Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!

BALA	You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
Z	Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.

Z	And you are...?
BALA	I'm Princess Bala.
Z	Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
BALA	Yes.
Z	Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.

BALA	No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Z	Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --

BALA	You dance...
Z	Divinely?
BALA	No weirdly...You remind me of someone...

BALA	He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Z	No...as a matter of fact...
BALA	OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!

Z	Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
BALA	I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Z	That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
BALA	Quiet -- sshhh!!
Z	-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
BALA	SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!

BALA	What <u>was</u> that thing?
Z	How should <u>I know</u>?
BALA	I order you to find out where we are!
Z	Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.

Z	Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
BALA	Climb up that tree and get a better view!

BALA	I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Z	Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
BALA	How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!

Z	Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
BALA	Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Z	But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
BALA	No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Z	Look around, sweetheart.

BALA	I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Z	Well I guess that makes us even.
BALA	Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Z	Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
BALA	I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Z	Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
BALA	I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?

BALA	Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Z	Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
BALA	<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Z	Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
BALA	Worker!  Come back here now!
Z	I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
BALA	That's not a name!  That's just a letter!

BALA	Water...water...
Z	Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
BALA	My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Z	<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.

BALA	We're going to die!
Z	Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?

BALA	Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Z	Want a list?
BALA	Wait, I hear something!

Z	This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
BALA	Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Z	Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --

BALA	Out here I'm just what?
Z	Hlllllllp!
BALA	Stop fooling around in there.

Z	Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
BALA	General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Z	Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
BALA	Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Z	And only you can become a Queen?
BALA	Well...no, but --
Z	So what makes you so special?
BALA	Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.

BALA	Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Z	Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
BALA	What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...

Z	We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
BALA	You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
Z	Let's dig in!

BALA	Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Z	Yes?
BALA	<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!

BALA	Come on, Z.
Z	Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".

Z	So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
BALA	Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Z	Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.

Z	Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
BALA	You held onto this all that time?
Z	Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.

Z	Why do they have you tied up here?
BALA	There's something going on, Z --

Z	Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
BALA	Oh no...

BALA	Z!  what are you doing?
Z	I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.

Z	I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
BALA	A <u>few</u>?

BALA	The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
HANDMAIDEN #2	There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
BALA	The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!

HANDMAIDEN #2	We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
BALA	I'm the Princess, aren't I?
HANDMAIDEN #2	Of course --
BALA	And do Princesses do improper things?
HANDMAIDEN #2	Of course not --
BALA	Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.

QUEEN	Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
BALA	It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?

QUEEN	I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
BALA	You did?
QUEEN	Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
BALA	Yes...he's wonderful...

BALA	Who is that idiot?
QUEEN	Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!

QUEEN	Bala!
BALA	Mom!

BARBATUS	You new, kid?
Z	I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
BARBATUS	Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.

BARBATUS	You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Z	Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
BARBATUS	No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Z	Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!

Z	Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
BARBATUS	Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!

Z	So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
BARBATUS	Superior numbers, kid!

BARBATUS	Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Z	Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.

Z	BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
BARBATUS	Don't get all sappy about it!

BARBATUS	Z!  Over here!
Z	Barbatus?

Z	Barbatus!
BARBATUS	Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Z	No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
BARBATUS	No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Z	Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
BARBATUS	I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Z	Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
BARBATUS	Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...

CARPENTER	Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
FORMICA	Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?

CARPENTER	Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
FORMICA	Outstanding.  Princess...?

CARPENTER	Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
FORMICA	Duty calls!

FORMICA	Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
CARPENTER	I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!

FORMICA	Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
CARPENTER	Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
FORMICA	No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.

FORMICA	What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
CARPENTER	Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
FORMICA	Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
CARPENTER	Ant Team Six...

FORMICA	What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
CARPENTER	Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...

FORMICA	So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
WEAVER	Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
FORMICA	Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
WEAVER	Oh, no, sir!
FORMICA	Good.  You're a good soldier.
WEAVER	Thank you, sir.

FORMICA	So tell me.  Where's Z?
WEAVER	I...I have no idea, sir.
FORMICA	Okay, son.

FORMICA	We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
WEAVER	That's correct, sir!
FORMICA	Not that one.  Or that one.
WEAVER	No, sir!

Z	Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
FORMICA	Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Z	Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
FORMICA	Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.

Z	No -- you -- you don't understand!
FORMICA	Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Z	Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
FORMICA	Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Z	ONE TO NOTHING!

FORMICA	Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
Z	Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
FORMICA	Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Z	Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
FORMICA	Affirmative.
Z	So...you two are in love?
FORMICA	In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.

Z	Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
FORMICA	Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Z	...Not enough food?
FORMICA	Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.

Z	Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
FORMICA	I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Z	Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.

FORMICA	May I cut in?
Z	Oh, of course --

FORMICA	What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
Z	Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
FORMICA	ARREST HIM!
Z	Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --

QUEEN	General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
FORMICA	We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
QUEEN	Yes, what else?
FORMICA	Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.

QUEEN	No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
FORMICA	I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
QUEEN	Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.

FORMICA	Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
QUEEN	Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
FORMICA	I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --

QUEEN	All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
FORMICA	They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.

FORMICA	Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
QUEEN	But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
FORMICA	'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
QUEEN	Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
FORMICA	Alright, let's move out!

Z	I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!

Z	...I should?
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Ask me why we're so successful.
Z	Why are we so successful?
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	I'm glad you asked me that question!

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	What do you see out there?
Z	...Ants...
MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR	You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Z	But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.

Z	We declared war again?  Are you scared?
WEAVER	I'll be back.

Z	Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
WEAVER	I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Z	Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
WEAVER	Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.

Z	Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
WEAVER	Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Z	I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
WEAVER	Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Z	Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
WEAVER	And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Z	Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.

Z	Hey, did you hear what he said?!
WEAVER	Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.

WEAVER	Time to cut a rug, Z!
Z	I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
WEAVER	Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.

WEAVER	Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Z	Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
WEAVER	It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Z	What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!

Z	You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
WEAVER	I can't think of any.
Z	Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
WEAVER	Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Z	You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
WEAVER	Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...

WEAVER	Wear this.
Z	You're a real buddy.
WEAVER	Yeah, I know.
Z	What do I do?
WEAVER	Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!

Z	Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
WEAVER	You heard the ant -- DIG!!!

NEW JERSEY	So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
BILLY	Who're you?

BILLY	All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
NEW JERSEY	New Jersey?
BILLY	Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.

NEW JERSEY	November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
BILLY	You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
NEW JERSEY	Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
BILLY	Then that's it!

CASPER LINDLEY	Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.

CASPER LINDLEY	She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	You wanna take the chance, Casper?
CASPER LINDLEY	Not me. No way.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	There's another one we owe 'em.
CASPER LINDLEY	They're stealing my chopper!

BUCKAROO BANZAI	See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
PROF. HIKITA	The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
PROF. HIKITA	Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.

PROF. HIKITA	Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.

PROF. HIKITA	We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?

PROF. HIKITA	Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
PROF. HIKITA	What?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
PROF. HIKITA	It's your hand, Buckaroo.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.

PROF. HIKITA	Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
PROF. HIKITA	Planet 10?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-

BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm starving...somebody, help.
RAWHIDE	Got a half a tuna sandwich.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Same one you had yesterday?

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Then what?
RAWHIDE	Vanished. Thin air.

RAWHIDE	Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Have you warned Professor Hikita?
RAWHIDE	First thing I did.

RAWHIDE	The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
RAWHIDE	He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
RAWHIDE	And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
RAWHIDE	Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
BUCKAROO BANZAI	The deuce you say.  That crate!

RAWHIDE	What crate?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
RAWHIDE	Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?

BUCKAROO BANZAI	You okay?
RAWHIDE	Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...

RAWHIDE	You're a welcome sight...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Just 'grazed' you, huh?

RAWHIDE	Apache?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Arachtoid.
RAWHIDE	So I was right.  That's nice to know...

BUCKAROO BANZAI	We will, old fried, we will.
RAWHIDE	Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Anybody we know?
PERFECT TOMMY	Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?

PERFECT TOMMY	Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Not really.  This is pretty important.
PERFECT TOMMY	She wants a picture.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
PERFECT TOMMY	I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.

PERFECT TOMMY	Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

PERFECT TOMMY	Running a little late, Buckaroo.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Let her out. In my custody.
PERFECT TOMMY	Let her out?  She's a killer.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
PERFECT TOMMY	Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...

PERFECT TOMMY	It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	It?  Who does?

PERFECT TOMMY	Buckaroo--! Sorry--
BUCKAROO BANZAI	What is it, Tommy?
PERFECT TOMMY	Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Dead.  Damnit!
PERFECT TOMMY	Where's the professor?

PERFECT TOMMY	It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?

BUCKAROO BANZAI	All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
PERFECT TOMMY	New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
JOHN PARKER	They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	What is this thing?  A fighter?
JOHN PARKER	Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.

JOHN PARKER	We're going down!  Onto the runway!
BUCKAROO BANZAI	The door's locked.

JOHN PARKER	I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
JOHN PARKER	Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
JOHN PARKER	Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Now!

RENO	And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?

RENO	They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
BUCKAROO BANZAI	What? How do you know that?

RENO	...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?

RENO	...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?

RENO	Where're you goin'?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	To get my guns.

RENO	And they got Penny!  Look!
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Don't shoot!

RENO	They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Got a casualty list?
RENO	Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Raise your hand...where?
PENNY PRIDDY	This is so embarrassing...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
PENNY PRIDDY	Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Did you say..."Peggy"?
PENNY PRIDDY	My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
PENNY PRIDDY	Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	He offered you money?
PENNY PRIDDY	Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
PENNY PRIDDY	My name's, Penny!  But who cares?

PENNY PRIDDY	Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Everybody okay up here?

PENNY PRIDDY	What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
PENNY PRIDDY	Go away.  Let me rot?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Who were you really trying to kill last night?
PENNY PRIDDY	You.  Like the papers all say.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Pretty terrible shot.

PENNY PRIDDY	Was she pretty?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Who?
PENNY PRIDDY	The girl I remind you of.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
PENNY PRIDDY	It's kinda hard this way.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
PENNY PRIDDY	The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
PENNY PRIDDY	No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	No, I don't.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
PENNY PRIDDY	Which?  The one in my throat.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
PENNY PRIDDY	I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Another 'you'?
PENNY PRIDDY	Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
PENNY PRIDDY	What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...

BUCKAROO BANZAI	You keep an eye on it.
PENNY PRIDDY	Any time.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Open up or I'll shoot it off.
PENNY PRIDDY	I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.

PENNY PRIDDY	She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	She was killed, Penny.
PENNY PRIDDY	Oh, my.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.

PENNY PRIDDY	Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
PENNY PRIDDY	How did she die?  I wanna know.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	You don't wanna know.
PENNY PRIDDY	Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
PENNY PRIDDY	Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
BUCKAROO BANZAI	I wish he was.  He's real enough.

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Never.
PENNY PRIDDY	I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
PENNY PRIDDY	Go where?  Where're you going?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
PENNY PRIDDY	What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
PENNY PRIDDY	Believe in Penny Priddy?
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Absolutely.

PENNY PRIDDY	You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
BUCKAROO BANZAI	It's too dangerous.
PENNY PRIDDY	That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...

BUCKAROO BANZAI	Stay here, I'll be back.
PENNY PRIDDY	Sure.  I won't hold my breath.

PENNY PRIDDY	I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
BUCKAROO BANZAI	Penny--?!  Are you all right?

PRESIDENT WIDMARK	World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
PRESIDENT WIDMARK	That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
PRESIDENT WIDMARK	You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT WIDMARK	A what?
BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV	A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
PRESIDENT WIDMARK	You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.

JOHN O'CONNOR	What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ	A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ	Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
JOHN O'CONNOR	I have a radio fix...

JOHN O'CONNOR	Not here!  No Overthruster!
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ	John Whorfin will kill us!
JOHN O'CONNOR	You look!  It's not here!

JOHN O'CONNOR	But John Whorfin said kill her.
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ	Damn John Whorfin--!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK	Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
NATIONAL SECURITY MAN	No, sir.  I think the flint...
PRESIDENT WIDMARK	What's happening with my call to SAC?
NATIONAL SECURITY MAN	Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
PRESIDENT WIDMARK	Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
NATIONAL SECURITY MAN	Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
PRESIDENT WIDMARK	Should we be on Code Red?

PENNY PRIDDY	How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
RENO	Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
PENNY PRIDDY	What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
RENO	Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
PENNY PRIDDY	Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
RENO	Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.

PENNY PRIDDY	What's his problem?
RENO	Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
PENNY PRIDDY	Better than him.

PERFECT TOMMY	Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
RENO	Why me?

PERFECT TOMMY	Pick those up, Reno.
RENO	I didn't drop 'em.

PERFECT TOMMY	It's a spittin' image.
RENO	Doesn't look anything like her to me.
PERFECT TOMMY	Pictures don't lie.
RENO	Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
PERFECT TOMMY	It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?

PERFECT TOMMY	Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
RENO	You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
PERFECT TOMMY	Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.

RENO	The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
PERFECT TOMMY	Where do you hail from, Doc?

PERFECT TOMMY	Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
RENO	Why me?
PERFECT TOMMY	Cause Buckaroo needs me here.

PERFECT TOMMY	Any sign of Buckaroo?
RENO	No!  Ditto the professor-

RENO	We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
PERFECT TOMMY	Asshole probably got lost.

TV ANCHORWOMAN	So where's Buckaroo?
PERFECT TOMMY	Whadda you need Buckaroo for?

PERFECT TOMMY	Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
TV ANCHORWOMAN	Flying to Cambodia.

PERFECT TOMMY	That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
TV ANCHORWOMAN	Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
PERFECT TOMMY	Bet I do.

TV ANCHORWOMAN	Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
PERFECT TOMMY	She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.

MUDDY	Yer late.

BEAVIS	Beavis.

BEAVIS	Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
MUDDY	Just make sure it looks like an accident...

MARTHA	Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
BEAVIS	Yeah, we're gonna score.
MARTHA	I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
BEAVIS	Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
MARTHA	Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
BEAVIS	Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.

BEAVIS	Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
MARTHA	Oh, that's nice.

BEAVIS	I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
MARTHA	You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
BEAVIS	Really? I poop too much.
MARTHA	Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
BEAVIS	Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
MARTHA	Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.

MARTHA	They perk me right up.
BEAVIS	Heh heh, thanks.

BEAVIS	Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
MARTHA	Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
BEAVIS	Uh, we didn't score yet.
MARTHA	Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.

MARTHA	Does that say Xanax?
BEAVIS	Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.

FLEMMING	This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
FLEMMING	We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.

BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
FLEMMING	He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
FLEMMING	OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...

FLEMMING	...Two...
BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO	...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
FLEMMING	Thrr...

BORK	We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
FLEMMING	Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!

FLEMMING	Talk ta me, Bork.
BORK	Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
FLEMMING	Did you give him a full cavity search?
BORK	Ah, the witness?
FLEMMING	Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
BORK	Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.

BORK	They look like a couple of kids chief.
FLEMMING	Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?

FLEMMING	You see what I see, Bork?
BORK	I see it. I don't get it.
FLEMMING	You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
BORK	Cut the power!
FLEMMING	Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
BORK	Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...

FLEMMING	Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
BORK	It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.

BORK	Cavity search...?
FLEMMING	Deep and hard.

BORK	Chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
FLEMMING	Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
BORK	Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
FLEMMING	That's better. Yes?
BORK	We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 

FLEMMING	Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
BORK	Where did these guys come from?

FLEMMING	What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
BORK	D.C., Chief.
FLEMMING	Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!

FLEMMING	Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
BORK	Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
FLEMMING	Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.

BORK	Not on him, Chief.
FLEMMING	Agent Hurley...

BORK	Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
FLEMMING	Not now Bork.

BORK	We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
FLEMMING	Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.

BORK	Chief, look!
FLEMMING	Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.

FLEMMING	OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
BORK	Where are his pants?
FLEMMING	Who knows?

MUDDY	Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
BUTT-HEAD	Uh, Butt-Head.

BUTT-HEAD	Do her? Huh huh.
MUDDY	That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?

MUDDY	Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
BUTT-HEAD	Whoa, huh huh. Cool.

MUDDY	She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
BUTT-HEAD	Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.

MUDDY	One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
BUTT-HEAD	Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
MUDDY	She sure does.
BUTT-HEAD	This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.

MUDDY	Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
BUTT-HEAD	Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.

BUTT-HEAD	Cool. Huh huh huh.
MARTHA	It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.

BUTT-HEAD	Cool, huh huh huh.
MARTHA	That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.

MARTHA	This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
BUTT-HEAD	Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.

MARTHA	Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
BUTT-HEAD	Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD	Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
MARTHA	Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!

DUMB GUY	Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
BUTT-HEAD	Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.

BUTT-HEAD	You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
DUMB GUY	Yup. Huh huh.

BUTT-HEAD	Really? That's where we're from.
DUMB GUY	Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
BUTT-HEAD	You scored with two chicks?!
DUMB GUY	Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.

DUMB GUY	Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
BUTT-HEAD	Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
DUMB GUY	Hey, you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.

DALLAS	You got two seconds!
BUTT-HEAD	Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?

DALLAS	Who sent ya?
BUTT-HEAD	Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
DALLAS	Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
BUTT-HEAD	Uh, ten uh...
DALLAS	Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
BUTT-HEAD	Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.

JANE	Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
ADAM	No, Jane.
JANE	You'll be rich!
ADAM	We're rich in what really matters.
JANE	Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
ADAM	So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
JANE	Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  You don't have to answer now.  He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  You take your vacation, Adam.  Say 'bye!

JANE	Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
ADAM	I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!

ADAM	She's ready.
BARBARA	Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
ADAM	Almost.

ADAM	Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
BARBARA	Helen got it for me in Oslo.
ADAM	God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!

ADAM	Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
BARBARA	Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
ADAM	God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.

BARBARA	Oh no.
ADAM	It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.

BARBARA	Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
ADAM	Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.

ADAM	We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
BARBARA	I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
ADAM	Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.

BARBARA	Wave at the lion.
ADAM	Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
BARBARA	Adam!

BARBARA	Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
ADAM	Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
BARBARA	You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
ADAM	Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
BARBARA	Oh... I'm sorry...

BARBARA	This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
ADAM	How's your arm?
BARBARA	I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.

ADAM	You'd better sit down, hon.
BARBARA	I am sitting.
ADAM	I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
BARBARA	Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.

ADAM	You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
BARBARA	Two hours.
ADAM	What?
BARBARA	That's how long you were gone.
ADAM	... Hmmm?

ADAM	Anything happen while I was away?
BARBARA	Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.

ADAM	Handbook for the recently diseased.
BARBARA	De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
ADAM	Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.

BARBARA	I don't think we survived the crash.
ADAM	This is going to take some time.

BARBARA	I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
ADAM	This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
BARBARA	There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
ADAM	I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.

ADAM	Cabin fever, hon?
BARBARA	I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
ADAM	Maybe this is heaven.
BARBARA	In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
ADAM	Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
BARBARA	Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
ADAM	But I'm not hungry, are you?

ADAM	God, it's Jane Butterfield!
BARBARA	What's she doing here?
ADAM	I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!

BARBARA	She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
ADAM	Won't?  Or can't?
BARBARA	Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
ADAM	Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
BARBARA	At least we won't have to worry about her.

BARBARA	I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
ADAM	That's my girl!

BARBARA	Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
ADAM	They make gypsies look good.
BARBARA	Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
ADAM	I don't know if there's anything we can do.
BARBARA	We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.

ADAM	Oh, honey, we may need that.
BARBARA	No, I'm not putting up with this.

ADAM	Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
BARBARA	Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.

BARBARA	Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
ADAM	<u>You</u> left me.
BARBARA	I know.  I'm sorry.

BARBARA	We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
ADAM	You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
BARBARA	Death didn't improve your sense of humor.

BARBARA	Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
ADAM	Not really...  what's this?

BARBARA	That's it?  No number, or instructions?
ADAM	Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...

BARBARA	That little girl saw us.
ADAM	She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
BARBARA	But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
ADAM	That's all we need.

ADAM	There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
BARBARA	We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
ADAM	What about this Beetle guy?
BARBARA	We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
ADAM	Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
BARBARA	I don't know... what are you looking up?
ADAM	We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
BARBARA	Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.

BARBARA	Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
ADAM	Wait.

ADAM	... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
BARBARA	No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.

ADAM	My God, we're back where we started.
BARBARA	Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
ADAM	How long do you suppose we were waiting?

ADAM	We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
BARBARA	We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --

BARBARA	That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
ADAM	Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.

BARBARA	God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
ADAM	Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.

BARBARA	I feel really stupid.
ADAM	It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!

BARBARA	Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
ADAM	Where are your skulls and bones?
BARBARA	You know you're really a pretty girl.

BARBARA	Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
ADAM	She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
BARBARA	Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
ADAM	This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.

BARBARA	Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
ADAM	Of course I did.
BARBARA	Then it should be here.

BARBARA	Here's something.
ADAM	I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
BARBARA	... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...

ADAM	Go ahead... third time's a charm.
BARBARA	<u>Betelgeuse</u>!

BARBARA	What happened?
ADAM	Three times.  Powerful number.
BARBARA	Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.

ADAM	Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
BARBARA	Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.

ADAM	I guess we open it.
BARBARA	Maybe we should knock first?

BARBARA	She's only fourteen...
ADAM	... acts like she's thirty-five.

BARBARA	Honey.  Let's go.
ADAM	Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
BARBARA	No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.

ADAM	Honey, I think that was a mistake.
BARBARA	I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
ADAM	But <u>we</u> let him out.
BARBARA	I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.

ADAM	And your sushi was remarkable.
BARBARA	The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
ADAM	N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
BARBARA	Who did the sushi?

ADAM	Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
BARBARA	He might have hurt somebody.
ADAM	But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.

BARBARA	<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
ADAM	I didn't --

BARBARA	Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
ADAM	... we wouldn't have had our little accident.

BARBARA	You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
ADAM	Little black party dresses?
BARBARA	Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
ADAM	Let's see if she can get my model back.
BARBARA	You can build another one... with her.

BARBARA	We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
ADAM	What makes you think she likes me?

ADAM	What...?
BARBARA	Just a hunch.

ADAM	What time is it?
BARBARA	3:30 I guess.
ADAM	Give or take a year.

BARBARA	Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
ADAM	All right.

LYDIA	A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
ADAM	We're ghosts.

ADAM	Aren't you scared?
LYDIA	I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
ADAM	What?
LYDIA	<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.

ADAM	You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
LYDIA	Is this like a trick question?

ADAM	Nobody else can.
LYDIA	I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.

LYDIA	Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
ADAM	We were trying to scare your mother.
LYDIA	Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.

LYDIA	<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
ADAM	I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
LYDIA	And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
ADAM	We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
LYDIA	You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?

ADAM	We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
LYDIA	God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?

ADAM	You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
LYDIA	Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?

ADAM	What is going on?
LYDIA	Really.  I don't know.

ADAM	Did you get the paint?
LYDIA	I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.

ADAM	We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
LYDIA	I got an A!

LYDIA	So can I?
ADAM	Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
LYDIA	Oh puh-leeze!

RECEPTIONIST	You don't have an appointment, do you?
ADAM	W... We didn't know how to make one.

ADAM	Nine months?  What difference does that make?
RECEPTIONIST	Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
ADAM	Help vouchers?
RECEPTIONIST	D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.

ADAM	Wait for who?
RECEPTIONIST	For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.

ADAM	Aren't you dead?
BETELGEUSE	Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
ADAM	You don't kill anyone.

BETELGEUSE	<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
ADAM	But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
BETELGEUSE	You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
ADAM	Can you scare them off?

ADAM	Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
BETELGEUSE	Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!

ADAM	This is <u>my</u> town.
BETELGEUSE	You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.

ADAM	<u>Barbara</u>?!!
BETELGEUSE	Now, let's get rolling!

ADAM	Are you available?
JUNO	No.  What's wrong?

JUNO	Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
ADAM	We tried.
JUNO	The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.

JUNO	I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
ADAM	We have to start simpler, is that it?
JUNO	Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?

JUNO	<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
ADAM	And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?

ADAM	Handbook?  When...?
JUNO	<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
ADAM	Well, we didn't know --

JUNO	Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
ADAM	<u>Out</u>.

BETELGEUSE	All right.  Who are you?
BARBARA	We're...
BETELGEUSE	You're the dead.

BARBARA	Just get some people out of our house.
BETELGEUSE	Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
BARBARA	Just one daughter.
BETELGEUSE	Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.

BETELGEUSE	Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
BARBARA	Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!

BARBARA	I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
BETELGEUSE	Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.

BETELGEUSE	You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
BARBARA	I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?

JUNO	I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
BARBARA	Are you Juno, our case worker?
JUNO	Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
BARBARA	We need help.  We deserve help.

BARBARA	We're very unhappy.
JUNO	What do you expect?  You're dead.

JUNO	-- Like you used to be?
BARBARA	Yes.

BARBARA	No.
JUNO	Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.

BARBARA	If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
JUNO	No.  You don't want his help.

JUNO	No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
BARBARA	What do you mean?  What's he do?
JUNO	He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
BARBARA	Our cemetery?
JUNO	Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.

JUNO	The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
BARBARA	About what?
JUNO	You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.

BARBARA	What about Betelgeuse?
JUNO	Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.

BARBARA	If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
LYDIA	You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
BARBARA	We're practicing.

BARBARA	Tell the truth.
LYDIA	I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.

BARBARA	We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
LYDIA	Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?

LYDIA	I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
BARBARA	Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.

LYDIA	I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
BARBARA	No, wait!

LYDIA	He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
BARBARA	No, Lydia, we're dead.
LYDIA	I want to be dead too.
BARBARA	No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
LYDIA	Life is just... too awful.

BARBARA	So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
LYDIA	Step... mother.

BARBARA	How'd you do on the science test?
LYDIA	It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.

JANE	Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
BARBARA	That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
JANE	Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
BARBARA	No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
JANE	Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
BARBARA	Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
JANE	You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
BARBARA	And live in what, our station wagon?
JANE	Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.

JANE	Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
BARBARA	'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.

LYDIA	Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
BETELGEUSE	They're dead.

BETELGEUSE	Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
LYDIA	Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
BETELGEUSE	No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
LYDIA	Where'd they go?
BETELGEUSE	The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
LYDIA	Are you a spirit too?
BETELGEUSE	Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
LYDIA	I want to get in.
BETELGEUSE	You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
LYDIA	I think so.
BETELGEUSE	Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
LYDIA	Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
BETELGEUSE	That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
LYDIA	Yeah.
BETELGEUSE	I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
LYDIA	I... I don't know what your name is.
BETELGEUSE	Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
LYDIA	Yes.
BETELGEUSE	Of course you do.

LYDIA	Three syllables.
BETELGEUSE	No, dummy.  Two.
LYDIA	Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.

LYDIA	I don't know what that signal means.
BETELGEUSE	It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.

LYDIA	Beetle!
BETELGEUSE	Good girrrl!

LYDIA	Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
BETELGEUSE	Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!

LYDIA	I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
BETELGEUSE	That's it!
LYDIA	Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
BETELGEUSE	It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.

LYDIA	God, you're anatomically correct!
BETELGEUSE	Just <u>say</u> it.
LYDIA	You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
BETELGEUSE	You've <u>got</u> to say it!
LYDIA	No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
BETELGEUSE	How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
LYDIA	They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
BETELGEUSE	How'd you like to be married to... the King...?

BETELGEUSE	So... You're ready for me now?
LYDIA	You've got to help them.
BETELGEUSE	Can you help <u>me</u>?
LYDIA	... I will.
BETELGEUSE	Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.

LYDIA	W... What is it?
LYDIA	Your qu...?  But you're...
BETELGEUSE	I'm beeyoo-teeful.

OTHO	Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
CHARLES	That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.

CHARLES	Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
OTHO	He's a cloven-hooved beast!
CHARLES	He's your cousin.
OTHO	I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.

CHARLES	Otho?
OTHO	It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.

DELIA	It's <u>Otho</u>!
CHARLES	Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?

DELIA	I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
CHARLES	There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.

DELIA	Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
CHARLES	We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.

DELIA	I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
CHARLES	At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
DELIA	Otho'll know what to do.
CHARLES	What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
DELIA	Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
CHARLES	Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
DELIA	Just don't tell Lydia.
CHARLES	Why not?
DELIA	I think she's in with them.

CHARLES	They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
DELIA	Not these people!  They are ruthless!

CHARLES	What do you think, honey?
LYDIA	Delia hates it.

CHARLES	Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
LYDIA	My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.

LYDIA	Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
CHARLES	Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.

CHARLES	Where is your mother?
LYDIA	Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
CHARLES	Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.

LYDIA	I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
CHARLES	Let me have it.

CHARLES	Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
LYDIA	Stepmother.
CHARLES	... asked you for something, didn't she?  I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone. Do you understand?  Noise free.

CHARLES	What?
LYDIA	I'm lonely.

CHARLES	Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
LYDIA	Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
CHARLES	Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.

LYDIA	Dad.  Do you believe me?
CHARLES	Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
LYDIA	Stepmother's...
CHARLES	... sheets.
LYDIA	Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
CHARLES	Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
LYDIA	<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.

CHARLES	The attic room is locked --
LYDIA	They're ghosts.  They do what they want.

CHARLES	Answer your mother.
LYDIA	Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?

CHARLES	Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
LYDIA	Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.

CHARLES	Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
LYDIA	I cannot believe this.
CHARLES	Delia will cook...

CHARLES	I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
LYDIA	I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
CHARLES	Otho, could you actually... do something with them?

LYDIA	They're... not here anymore.
CHARLES	Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.

CHARLES	Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
MAXIE	Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
CHARLES	No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.

CHARLES	Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody...
MAXIE	No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
CHARLES	Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
MAXIE	Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?

MAXIE	I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
CHARLES	Otho, can you do it?

CHARLES	Are they suffering?
MAXIE	They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.

LYDIA	I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
DELIA	This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?

DELIA	We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
LYDIA	I say let's keep it the way it is.

DELIA	<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
LYDIA	Any particular kind?
DELIA	Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.

DELIA	I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
LYDIA	I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
DELIA	Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.

DELIA	Don't you <u>dare</u>.
LYDIA	I saw some ghosts.

DELIA	Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
LYDIA	It wasn't a joke.
DELIA	Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.

LYDIA	I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
DELIA	Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.

DELIA	All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
LYDIA	Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
DELIA	It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!

DELIA	Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
LYDIA	I'm sorry already.

OTHO	That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
DELIA	I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.

OTHO	Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
DELIA	The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
OTHO	No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.

DELIA	What's wrong?
OTHO	I thought I saw something.

DELIA	Okay?
OTHO	You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
DELIA	<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
OTHO	Gooood!

DELIA	What do you think?
OTHO	Viridian?
DELIA	Viridian?  What is...?

OTHO	Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
DELIA	Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!

DELIA	<u>Oh my God</u>!
OTHO	<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.

DELIA	Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
OTHO	Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!

OTHO	Is there much more of this torture?
DELIA	That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
OTHO	Oh, as long as we're here...

OTHO	'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
DELIA	Attic space.
OTHO	Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.

OTHO	You don't have a key?
DELIA	Maybe Charles does.
OTHO	I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
DELIA	Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.

OTHO	Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
DELIA	<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
OTHO	Oh, Delia, lighten up!
DELIA	She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...

DELIA	It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
OTHO	We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.

OTHO	Look at that <u>detail</u>!
DELIA	Look at the tiny figures.

DELIA	Are they still here, Otho?
OTHO	Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.

DELIA	What's happening to them?
OTHO	I don't know.

JANE	Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
LYDIA	What happened to the people who used to live here?

LYDIA	Is this the key to the attic?
JANE	That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.

JANE	Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
LYDIA	Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
JANE	Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.

JANE	Hellooo!  How's school?
LYDIA	It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
JANE	Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.

OTHO	It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
LYDIA	Hold your breath and we'll pull.

LYDIA	Otho, that's terrible.
OTHO	My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!

LYDIA	They don't want to come down.
OTHO	Why not?

OTHO	All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
LYDIA	The attic.

OTHO	Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
LYDIA	That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!

LYDIA	Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
OTHO	I'll need something personal of theirs.

LYDIA	Their wedding clothes.
OTHO	Their wedding clothes.

LYDIA	<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
OTHO	As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.

AARON	Shit, shit, shit...
TOM	You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.

TOM	Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
AARON	Yeah.

TOM	One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
AARON	You write this?

TOM	...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
AARON	Nice, Jane.

TOM	Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
AARON	Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

TOM	You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
AARON	Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.

TOM	What did I do to you?
AARON	You've made my dreams silly.

AARON	How <u>you</u> doing?
TOM	Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
AARON	Keep it to yourself.
TOM	You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
AARON	Oh, stop it.

AARON	You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
TOM	I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
AARON	You have the job you have...

TOM	Shut up a second...
AARON	Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
TOM	I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
AARON	And the rule was...
TOM	Never to pretend to know more than I did.
AARON	Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
TOM	Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
AARON	We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?

AARON	Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
TOM	Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
AARON	Okay.

TOM	Yes.
AARON	There are only ten.

TOM	You're feeling good, aren't you?
AARON	I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
TOM	Fifty, right?

AARON	I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
TOM	What's wrong with it?
AARON	Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.

AARON	This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
TOM	We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
AARON	It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.

TOM	Wait.
AARON	What?
TOM	Your coat jacket is rising up in back.

AARON	I don't like being handled.
TOM	Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
AARON	Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.

TOM	No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
AARON	It's not loaded.
TOM	I'll find some copy.  Be right back.

TOM	No.  No.
AARON	No?
TOM	Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
AARON	Oh, God, no!
TOM	And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --

TOM	You were smokin' toward the end there.
AARON	The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.

TOM	Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
AARON	Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
TOM	No.  Don't worry about it.
AARON	I'll put her on.

AARON	What did they do with you?
TOM	They booted me out of Washington.
AARON	Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
TOM	Why?  What did they do to you?

TOM	You packing up tonight?
AARON	Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
TOM	London.
AARON	London.  That's a promotion!
TOM	I don't think so.
AARON	It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
TOM	Hold it down, okay?
AARON	Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?

TOM	Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
AARON	No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.

AARON	This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
TOM	I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...

TOM	You know what I...
AARON	No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.

AARON	Hi.
TOM	Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?

AARON	I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
TOM	I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
AARON	Okay.
TOM	I'll see you back at the hotel.

AARON	He excels at gratitude.
TOM	Are you any closer to a decision?

TOM	It's nice to see you.
AARON	Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
TOM	If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
AARON	Why?

AARON	It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
BUDDY	Yes.
AARON	That's your full name?
BUDDY	Yes.
AARON	I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
BUDDY	Yes.
AARON	You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
BUDDY	I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
AARON	Eventually rising to...
BUDDY	Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.

AARON	You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
BUDDY	I don't like the word gay.
AARON	Which would you prefer?
BUDDY	Ravenous homosexual.
AARON	Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out.

AARON	Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
JANE	At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
AARON	Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
JANE	A half hour in the lobby.
AARON	Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].

AARON	Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
JANE	No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.

AARON	He must have been great-looking, right?
JANE	Why do you say that?
AARON	Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.

AARON	Okay.  Let's do me.
JANE	Sure.
AARON	Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
JANE	This conversation is not worthy of you.
AARON	I'd give anything if that were true.
JANE	Good night.
AARON	Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
JANE	Call if you get weird.

AARON	They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
JANE	You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?

JANE	Nine seconds.
AARON	Eleven and a half.
JANE	Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?

AARON	I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
JANE	If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
AARON	Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
JANE	You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.

JANE	Okay.  Great line at the end.
AARON	Did you shoot their boots?
JANE	Of course.
AARON	We can cut back at the end.
JANE	To the pan of the supplies boxes --
AARON	Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.

JANE	I write for you sometimes.
AARON	Not because you have to.

AARON	What happened?
JANE	I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
AARON	Watch? --
JANE	I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.

AARON	I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
JANE	Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.

AARON	Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
JANE	Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
AARON	You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.

JANE	Well, whatever you think.
AARON	I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
JANE	Sounds like you may be on to something.
AARON	Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.

JANE	You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
AARON	Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
JANE	Yes.
AARON	Good.

AARON	Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
JANE	A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?

JANE	Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
AARON	They're not that dumb, after all.

JANE	Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
AARON	I didn't know you were going with him.
JANE	Did you bring your grey suit?
AARON	Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?

JANE	I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
AARON	Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
JANE	It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.

AARON	Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
JANE	As good as humanly possible.
AARON	Yes.
JANE	Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
AARON	Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
JANE	I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
AARON	<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
JANE	Okay, great -- good luck.

AARON	Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
JANE	You too.

JANE	How'd it go?
AARON	You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
JANE	No.
AARON	Then it went well.
JANE	Did it really go well?
AARON	Define your terms.
JANE	Do you feel good about it?
AARON	No.
JANE	Do others feel that you did well?
AARON	No.
JANE	Then what was good about it?
AARON	I lost six pounds...
JANE	Aaron, will you tell me?
AARON	It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
JANE	What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
AARON	People phoned in.
JANE	Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
AARON	I'm not kidding.
JANE	There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
AARON	No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
JANE	If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
AARON	I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
JANE	I have to be somewhere.

JANE	I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
AARON	Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
JANE	I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
AARON	No!!!!!

AARON	Don't go.
JANE	This is important to me.
AARON	Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.

JANE	What?
AARON	Let me think a second.  It's tough.

AARON	Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
JANE	Yes, I guess.  Yes.
AARON	You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
JANE	Yeah -- being a basket case.
AARON	I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
JANE	This isn't friendship.
AARON	What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.

JANE	I think you're the Devil.
AARON	No.  You know that I'm not.
JANE	How?
AARON	Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.

JANE	You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
AARON	Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.

AARON	I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
JANE	Sit down, stop.

JANE	Don't say anything about anything.
AARON	Hi.  Will I ever sing again?

JANE	Bastard, sneak, quitter.
AARON	Speaking.
JANE	I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.

JANE	Why not try it for a few weeks?
AARON	Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
JANE	Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
AARON	Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
JANE	You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.

AARON	Let's go...
JANE	I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
AARON	Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.

JANE	You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
AARON	Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
JANE	Yes.
AARON	I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
JANE	You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
AARON	I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?

JANE	I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
AARON	Really?
JANE	I'm going to take it.

AARON	So who's the guy?
JANE	Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.

JANE	I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
AARON	Well -- my wife got this new job...

AARON	Ready.
CAMERAMAN	Your hair's a little funny.
AARON	It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
CAMERAMAN	In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
AARON	No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.

CAMERAMAN	Okay.
AARON	In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...

AARON	Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
CAMERAMAN	I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
AARON	In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.

ERNIE	I saw the smile -- good piece.
AARON	I'm gonna go look at it again.

ERNIE	I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
AARON	You didn't say anything to her?

AARON	That's it.  I resign as of now.
ERNIE	Stop it.
AARON	I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

ERNIE	Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
AARON	Outside?
ERNIE	Yeah --

ERNIE	I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
AARON	Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
ERNIE	We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
AARON	Wipe me out?

ERNIE	Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
AARON	Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
ERNIE	Upper management thinks you're dull.

ERNIE	Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
AARON	Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
ERNIE	I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
AARON	Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
ERNIE	All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
AARON	Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
ERNIE	I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.

AARON	Do it then.
ERNIE	Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
AARON	Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
ERNIE	It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.

AARON	Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
ERNIE	I understand.  I'll go with you.
AARON	Thanks.

ERNIE	It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
AARON	They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
ERNIE	The cost-efficient reporter.
AARON	So I quit.

AARON	Just a few questions?
J.D.	No.

AARON	We came from Washington.
J.D.	Move away from me.
AARON	How long has it been since you've been home.
J.D.	Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
AARON	It depends on how big a news day it is.

AARON	All this business of war -- do you get scared?
J.D.	Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.

BLAIR	Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
AARON	What is she shooting?
BLAIR	Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
AARON	Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.

AARON	Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
BLAIR	We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.

BLAIR	I was a little nervous there for a minute.
AARON	Oh, come on -- tell us another.

BLAIR	Goodbye, Paul.
AARON	Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
BLAIR	You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
AARON	No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
BLAIR	My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.

BILL	Just when do you start, telling people?
PAUL	Almost immediately.
BILL	I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
PAUL	Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
BILL	If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.

BILL	This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
PAUL	You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.

BILL	Jane?
JANE	Yes.
BILL	Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
JANE	Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.

JANE	But thanks.
BILL	Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.

JANE	Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
BILL	Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
JANE	No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
BILL	I'll speak to you soon

BLAIR	You don't have time.  Not a chance.
JANE	I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

BLAIR	I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
JANE	Yes, there is.

BLAIR	What did he say?
JANE	I'll never tell.

JANE	Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
BLAIR	I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.

JANE	Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
BLAIR	And Bobbie says...
JANE	Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
BLAIR	Yes.

BLAIR	It's Aaron.
JANE	Yes?

BLAIR	Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
JANE	No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

JANE	What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
BLAIR	I spent a fortune on this.

BLAIR	They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
JANE	It's started.

JANE	Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
BOBBIE	We could...
JANE	Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

JANE	Play back the last line...
BOBBIE	He said something about...
JANE	Let me hear it!

JANE	Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
BOBBIE	Should I...
JANE	Just a two-second dissolve.

BOBBIE	Do you want him all the way to the car?
JANE	No stop where he's all besieged.
BOBBIE	Because...
JANE	Right there, Bobbie.

BOBBIE	You know, I like Tom, because hi...
JANE	Bobbie, please.

BUDDY	They're not really going to call security are they?
TOM	No, I don't think so.
BUDDY	How do I get out of here?
TOM	Follow me.
BUDDY	You talked me into it.

TOM	I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
BUDDY	Bad manners.
TOM	Yes.  That's right.
BUDDY	I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
TOM	No...no.
BUDDY	One's enough.

TOM	I really have to go.
BUDDY	Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
TOM	What?
BUDDY	Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
TOM	Yes.  How do you know?
BUDDY	My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.

BUDDY	...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
TOM	Thanks a lot, Buddy.
BUDDY	Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
TOM	Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
BUDDY	I see the change in you -- I see it.

BUDDY	Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
TOM	Nobody else had it.
BUDDY	I wish it were you giving the story.
TOM	That's okay.
BUDDY	What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
TOM	No.  Really...don't worry about it.
BUDDY	Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
TOM	What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.

TOM	Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
BUDDY	Okay.

BUDDY	Is everything all right?
TOM	Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
BUDDY	Anchor?
TOM	Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
BUDDY	I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
TOM	Oh.
BUDDY	Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
TOM	No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

BUDDY	Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
TOM	Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
BUDDY	...good-bye then.
TOM	I'll speak to you.
BUDDY	Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'

WIFE	Ernie, they're calling from work.
ERNIE	Tell me I'm on the way in.
WIFE	It's Paul.

WIFE	What?
ERNIE	They fired me.

WIFE	How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
ERNIE	No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
WIFE	I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.

ERNIE	Bye, sweetie.
WIFE	Okay, sweetie.

JANE	...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
FATHER	Honey?...

FATHER	Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
JANE	I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
FATHER	You don't have to finish tonight.
JANE	Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
FATHER	Finish quickly.  I don't want you getting obsessive about these things.  Good night.

GERALD	I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
TOM	No.  Not even you.
GERALD	Why so glum?
TOM	I don't know.
GERALD	Go ahead.
TOM	No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
GERALD	Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
TOM	No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."

GERALD	You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
TOM	Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
GERALD	As long as that's your only problem you're...
TOM	It's not.

TOM	I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
GERALD	Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
TOM	I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.

TOM	Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
GERALD	Would it help if I got you a tutor?
TOM	That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?

JANE	Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
PAUL	Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
JANE	It's not opinion.
PAUL	You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?

PAUL	It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
JANE	No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

PAUL	I had no idea she was this good.
JANE	Fill for a second.

JANE	Hi.
TOM	I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
JANE	Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
TOM	Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.

JANE	Hi.  I was worried I was early.
TOM	I was a lot earlier.

TOM	I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
JANE	I like "godsend."
TOM	I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.

JANE	If we could just eat first.
TOM	Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
JANE	Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.

JANE	Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
TOM	That actually goes on...
JANE	Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
TOM	Yes, sure.

JANE	Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
TOM	No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.

JANE	I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
JANE	So great -- right?
TOM	Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
JANE	How are you at back rubs?

TOM	Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
JANE	I trust you.
TOM	I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
JANE	What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
TOM	I don't write.

TOM	But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
JANE	Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
TOM	One year...almost one year.
JANE	So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.

JANE	It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
TOM	Uh-huh.
JANE	I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

TOM	Whoa, this was a mistake.
JANE	Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.

TOM	I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
JANE	Hey?
TOM	Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.

TOM	They said it would be okay if...
JANE	We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...

TOM	I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
JANE	You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
TOM	I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
JANE	No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
TOM	I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
JANE	'Really a lot appreciate it...'
TOM	You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --

JANE	I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
TOM	And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?

TOM	Hi.
JANE	How's it going?
TOM	Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
JANE	I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
TOM	Okay.

TOM	So he was indicted?
JANE	Yes.

JANE	Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
TOM	Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.

TOM	I've got another story.
JANE	Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
TOM	The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
JANE	Billion.
TOM	Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.

TOM	It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
JANE	What do you mean clean?
TOM	At work there's always this sort of film over you.
JANE	Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
TOM	You're great at taking the edge off a good time.

TOM	You okay?
JANE	Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.

JANE	Nervous?
TOM	Excited.

JANE	We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
TOM	George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.

TOM	You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
JANE	Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
TOM	Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.

TOM	You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
JANE	I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?

TOM	Jane?
JANE	Yeah?
TOM	I'll wait for you till seven.
JANE	Okay.

TOM	I didn't think you'd make it.
JANE	Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
TOM	There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
JANE	Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
TOM	Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
JANE	Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.

JANE	Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
TOM	I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
JANE	I'll be the judge of that.

JANE	It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
TOM	Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
JANE	I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...

TOM	Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
JANE	Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
TOM	Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...

TOM	I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
JANE	Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
TOM	Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
JANE	What?
TOM	I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
JANE	Well, what is it?
TOM	If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
JANE	Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

TOM	I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
JANE	Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
TOM	Yes.
JANE	I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
TOM	It's not important.
JANE	Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
TOM	What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
JANE	Nooo.  Is it your story?
TOM	No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
JANE	Why, you need me for the story?
TOM	No.  Were you going to you?
JANE	Uh-huh.
TOM	Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
JANE	Oh, good.
TOM	We can go together.

JANE	So you like me, huh?
TOM	I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

TOM	So what did you think?
JANE	It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
TOM	Yeah.

TOM	It's incredible who's here.
JANE	Who?
TOM	Me!

TOM	Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
JANE	Good.  That's it...See you.

TOM	You're not going to take off on me, are you?
JANE	Uh-uh.

TOM	You okay?
JANE	Great.

TOM	Why can't I let go of this woman?
JANE	Well...

JANE	At least kiss me when you do that.
TOM	You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
JANE	This is hysterical.

JANE	I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
TOM	Because you're nuts.
JANE	Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?

TOM	I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
JANE	Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
TOM	What?
JANE	Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
TOM	That's not it.
JANE	Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.

JANE	I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
TOM	I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
JANE	No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.

JANE	What happened?
TOM	Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
JANE	He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
TOM	It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
JANE	Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.

JANE	Hi.  It's me.
TOM	Where are you?
JANE	I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
TOM	Well, when?
JANE	I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
TOM	I know.  I taped it.
JANE	It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
TOM	Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?

JANE	Hi, again.  Sorry about...
TOM	No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
JANE	I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
TOM	I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
JANE	Uh-huh.
TOM	I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

TOM	Hello?
JANE	Yes.
TOM	Okay.  Good night.
JANE	Good night??!
TOM	Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
JANE	Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.

JANE	I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
TOM	He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
JANE	No.  Did he really?
TOM	Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
JANE	What?
TOM	That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
JANE	That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.

TOM	Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
JANE	How can you say that to me?
TOM	Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.

JANE	Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
TOM	That's yes?
JANE	That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'

TOM	Then give me a minute...
JANE	You fucking...

TOM	Why?
JANE	I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.

TOM	I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
JANE	Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
TOM	We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
JANE	Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
TOM	Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
JANE	It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
TOM	I got promoted for things like that.
JANE	Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
TOM	It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
JANE	It just proves that the difference we have are...
TOM	This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
JANE	It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
TOM	I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.

JANE	That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
TOM	You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.

JANE	I don't wan to discuss work.
TOM	Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
JANE	I knew what you meant.
TOM	What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.

JANE	You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
TOM	Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
JANE	It's okay.

JANE	So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
TOM	You want to come?
JANE	It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
TOM	Then you should stay here.
JANE	It's better when you let me say it.

TOM	Take it easy.
JANE	Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.

JANE	Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
TOM	A picnic?
JANE	I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.

TOM	What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
JANE	Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
TOM	Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
JANE	I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
TOM	Okay...It's so good to see you.

JENNIFER	This is very awkward.
JANE	Go ahead -- what?
JENNIFER	Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
JANE	God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
JENNIFER	You're saying stay away from him.
JANE	I can't be.

JENNIFER	I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
JANE	Right back to you.

TOM	So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
JENNIFER	How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
TOM	Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
JENNIFER	Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
TOM	This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
JENNIFER	I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.

JENNIFER	The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
TOM	It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.

TOM	Where's the bathroom?
JENNIFER	Through the closet.

JENNIFER	I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
TOM	I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.

TOM	That's enough.  That's enough.
YOUNG WOMAN	I'm sorry.
TOM	Are you okay?
YOUNG WOMAN	Yes, I'm sorry.
TOM	Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
YOUNG WOMAN	The way you were looking at me, I just went.

TOM	I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
YOUNG WOMAN	Uh-huh.
TOM	...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.

ALICE	Don't you work here?
WALTER	Not anymore!

ALICE	Would you like to do me?
WALTER	I just might.
ALICE	I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.

WALTER	That's not true I am a sculptor!
ALICE	Oh yeah?

ALICE	If you were an artist you could have created something!
WALTER	I'm going home!

ALICE	What are you doing here?
WALTER	I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.

ALICE	Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
WALTER	I didn't finish talking to you!
ALICE	Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
WALTER	I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.

ALICE	Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
WALTER	Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
ALICE	Yeah.

WALTER	Tonight.
ALICE	What, right now?
WALTER	Uh-huh.

ALICE	It's kind of dark -
WALTER	Shh!

ALICE	I'm almost ready -
WALTER	Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.

ALICE	That doesn't look like very much clay.
WALTER	Oh it's enough...
ALICE	Are you nervous, Walter?
WALTER	N-no...

ALICE	Not even a little bit?
WALTER	I already told you I'm not.
ALICE	When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
WALTER	Um...
ALICE	Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...

ALICE	A girl with a body like mine?
WALTER	You're breaking my concentration!

ALICE	Walter can I ask you something?
WALTER	What!
ALICE	Are you a virgin?

ALICE	It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
WALTER	Whaddya mean?
ALICE	Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.

WALTER	Look -  This pose is all wrong!
ALICE	I'll pose any way you want.

ART	Alright we're clear.
LOU	Anything new?
ART	Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
LOU	Is the manager cooperating?
ART	Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
LOU	Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
ART	You know it.  I'm out of here.

LOU	What the hell's going on?
ART	Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
LOU	What did he do?
ART	He made a cat.

LOU	See you later -
ART	Righto.

CARLA	Don't worry about him...what have you got?
WALTER	A thing I made.

CARLA	I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
WALTER	Honest?

WALTER	You really like it?
CARLA	Of course...it's wonderful.

CARLA	Great!  What is it?
WALTER	It's a...full length life-size figure!
CARLA	What's it called?
WALTER	Murdered man.

CARLA	It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
WALTER	Yeah it was all just an accident.

CARLA	Look at the size of it!
WALTER	It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
CARLA	Let's see it.
WALTER	Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
CARLA	You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.

CARLA	Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
WALTER	Me too.

CARLA	How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
WALTER	It wasn't easy.

WALTER	Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
CARLA	Now you're a professional!

CARLA	Hi Walter.
WALTER	Carla...

CARLA	These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
WALTER	Oh...

CARLA	What's up, Walter?
WALTER	I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
CARLA	Oh yeah?
WALTER	Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?

CARLA	Is it murdered man?
WALTER	Better!

WALTER	You think she's better than Murdered Man?
CARLA	Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.

CARLA	More champagne, your majesty?
WALTER	Here here...

CARLA	Where where...
WALTER	There there...

WALTER	May I please have another little kiss?
CARLA	Walter!  Jeez!
WALTER	Sorry...

WALTER	Did you hear what he said?
CARLA	Yes Walter.
WALTER	All about me...

WALTER	It's true, isn't it?
CARLA	Every word...

WALTER	I know what it is to be ignored.
CARLA	Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
WALTER	I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...

WALTER	I mean, you look so pretty.
CARLA	Thank you.
WALTER	Are you ready?
CARLA	Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
WALTER	I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.

CARLA	Goodbye.
WALTER	Bye!

CARLA	Nice night out...
WALTER	Hm...

CARLA	Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
WALTER	Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
CARLA	Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
WALTER	You think I'm creative?
CARLA	Of course I do!
WALTER	That means you like me!

CARLA	I like you very much, Walter.
WALTER	I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!

CARLA	Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
WALTER	Carla -

WALTER	- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
CARLA	What are you trying to say?

CARLA	Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
WALTER	Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.

WALTER	But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
CARLA	Walter, I'm sorry...
WALTER	You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!

CARLA	Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
WALTER	No! I want to talk about it now!
CARLA	Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
WALTER	Why not?!
CARLA	Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
CARLA	Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
WALTER	Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!

WALTER	I'm sorry about what I said before.
CARLA	Forget it.
WALTER	I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
CARLA	Just about anything, Walter.
WALTER	Would you let me make...a statue of you?

CARLA	Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
WALTER	Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?

CARLA	Walter...there's...
WALTER	What?
CARLA	There's...a body inside that statue!

CARLA	Walter...stay away from me!
WALTER	Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.

CARLA	That's word for word.
MAXWELL	Is it?  I've forgotten.

CARLA	Here you go, enjoy.
MAXWELL	I hope this was made with egg whites!
CARLA	It was.
MAXWELL	What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
CARLA	Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
MAXWELL	Hm.

MAXWELL	Put it in the middle of the room!
CARLA	When did you make this, Walter?

CARLA	Walter...I can't believe it.
MAXWELL	I'm honored to know this man.

LEONARD	Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
CARLA	Do you have to be so cold to him?

CARLA	I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
LEONARD	Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...

CARLA	Hi Walter...
LEONARD	What are you doing here so early?

CARLA	Maybe so...
LEONARD	I wouldn't give up your day job.

LEONARD	You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
CARLA	Leonard, what are you doing?

CARLA	Are you trying to be funny?
LEONARD	I'm totally serious!

LEONARD	Murdered...man?...
CARLA	When do we get to see it? WALTER Well...any time, I guess.

CARLA	Are you alright?
LEONARD	Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.

LEONARD	Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
CARLA	Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?

CARLA	What's the matter with you?
LEONARD	Nothing...nothing at all.
CARLA	I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
LEONARD	Don't ask.
CARLA	Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.

CARLA	Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
LEONARD	I admit it.

LEONARD	No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
CARLA	Why not?
LEONARD	Why don't you cover it up, Walter!

CARLA	What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
LEONARD	Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
CARLA	You're right.  We should build a collection first.

LEONARD	It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
CARLA	That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
LEONARD	Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.

LEONARD	Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
CARLA	Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
LEONARD	You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!

LEONARD	Would you pose for me for free?
CARLA	Well, it all depends, Leonard...

CUFF	It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
LINK	I do the research.

LINK	Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
CUFF	Not only that, he copied us!

CUFF	Look at that, man.  Big deal.
LINK	I know.
CUFF	I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
LINK	I know, man.
CUFF	But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
LINK	I know, man.
CUFF	I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
LINK	I know, man.

LINK	I wonder what his deal is.
CUFF	I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!

LINK	Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
CUFF	I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
LINK	Now what kind of statue was that?
CUFF	I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...

CUFF	There's that weird dude again.
LINK	Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...

CUFF	Man look at that get up !
LINK	Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
CUFF	Let's check out the scene.

CUFF	Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
LINK	Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -

LINK	Man this is heavy!
CUFF	Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?

CUFF	What did he say?
LINK	Didn't you hear him?
CUFF	No man I'm on my own plane.

CUFF	Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
LINK	No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
CUFF	Maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  Maybe he started taking it.

CUFF	That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
LINK	Yeah, right outside the door!

LEONARD	Walter, what are you doing?
WALTER	I was just looking at Carla's picture.
LEONARD	Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
WALTER	Well I was uh, just looking...
LEONARD	Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...

WALTER	Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
LEONARD	What is it, your laundry?
WALTER	Huh?

LEONARD	Where'd ya buy that?
WALTER	I didn't buy it I made it.

LEONARD	You...made that?
WALTER	I said I did, didn't I!

WALTER	Dead Cat!
LEONARD	Dead Cat?
WALTER	Yeah.
LEONARD	Well it sure looks dead enough.

WALTER	You want to buy it, put it in the club?
LEONARD	You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.

LEONARD	Well...why did you put a knife in it?
WALTER	I didn't mean to.
LEONARD	Got carried away, huh?

LEONARD	Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
WALTER	Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.

WALTER	All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
LEONARD	Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
WALTER	Sure!

WALTER	People seem to like my cat.
LEONARD	Enough already about it - get to work!

WALTER	Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
LEONARD	Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
WALTER	Well I don't know -

LEONARD	No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
WALTER	Well...
LEONARD	Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
WALTER	I don't have another cat!
LEONARD	Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
WALTER	A parakeet?

LEONARD	Go home.
WALTER	OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
LEONARD	Good night Walter.

WALTER	H-have a seat?
LEONARD	Have a seat -

WALTER	I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
LEONARD	Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
WALTER	They are?

WALTER	Hiya Carla.
LEONARD	What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.

LEONARD	You know what that proves?
WALTER	What, Mr. De Santis?

LEONARD	The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
WALTER	I-I already got a new one!

LEONARD	Well...why murdered man?
WALTER	I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
LEONARD	You didn't mean to what?
WALTER	Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.

LEONARD	It's hot in here...
WALTER	You want me to open a window or something?

WALTER	A show?!  Like this Sunday?
LEONARD	N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...

WALTER	A show..how soon can we go?
LEONARD	These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...

LEONARD	You better hold off on the bubbly.
WALTER	Yeah, why?
LEONARD	You might talk too much.
WALTER	Yeah and what would I say?

WALTER	Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
LEONARD	It was.

LEONARD	What do you have in the box?
WALTER	Just wait till you see this!

WALTER	Whatsamatter Leonard?
LEONARD	You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?

WALTER	Whatsamatter Leonard?
LEONARD	Put it down, Walter.

LEONARD	Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
WALTER	Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
LEONARD	Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
WALTER	Well, w-what did you do?
LEONARD	Never mind...

LEONARD	When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
WALTER	Yeah?
LEONARD	Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...

PLUMP MAN	I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
LEONARD	Excuse me I have to make a call...

PLUMP MAN	I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
LEONARD	I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
PLUMP MAN	What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
LEONARD	I can't talk right now.
PLUMP MAN	What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
LEONARD	No...look I'm busy...
PLUMP MAN	Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
LEONARD	I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
PLUMP MAN	Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
LEONARD	Can't you see I'm busy here?

LOU	How ya doin'?
WALTER	Uh, hi.

LOU	Hello, Walter.
WALTER	Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
LOU	Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
WALTER	Uh, sure.

WALTER	I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
LOU	Hm.
WALTER	Did you see my cat?
LOU	Yeah I did.

LOU	I also saw the girl give you this.
WALTER	Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.

LOU	You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
WALTER	Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
LOU	You can cut the crap.

LOU	Police officer.
WALTER	You're like an undercover guy!
LOU	You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
WALTER	Huh?!!!
LOU	Possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?

LOU	But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
WALTER	C-connection?
LOU	I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
WALTER	Telling you what?
LOU	Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
WALTER	Smack?
LOU	Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
WALTER	Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
LOU	Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
WALTER	Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
LOU	Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.

LOU	Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
WALTER	You are?
LOU	Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me.

WALTER	I- don't know what you're talking about!
LOU	You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
WALTER	Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
LOU	I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
WALTER	I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
LOU	Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
WALTER	Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
LOU	Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
WALTER	I ain't going no place with you!

WALTER	You're gonna shoot me!
LOU	Turn around!

LOU	What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
WALTER	NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
LOU	Relax!

WALTER	YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
LOU	Walter shut up and relax!
WALTER	NO YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON'T SHOOT -

MAXWELL	I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
WALTER	I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
MAXWELL	Well I'm overjoyed.
WALTER	Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -

WALTER	I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
MAXWELL	I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
WALTER	I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 

WALTER	Are you done with these?
MAXWELL	Yes, get rid of them...

MAXWELL	I saw your...cat.
WALTER	Did you like it Mister Brock?
MAXWELL	Call me...Maxwell.

WALTER	Maxwell.
MAXWELL	I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.

MAXWELL	And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
WALTER	Uh, I don't know.

WALTER	Hi.
MAXWELL	Good morning Walter!

MAXWELL	Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
WALTER	No thanks.  Sounds good though.
MAXWELL	Suit yourself.

WALTER	An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
MAXWELL	Here here!

MAXWELL	After that we go no more!
WALTER	Hiya Maxwell.

MAXWELL	I won't say good luck, Walter.
WALTER	Why not?
MAXWELL	It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!

MAXWELL	Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
WALTER	I thought you didn't respect money!
MAXWELL	I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!

MAYOLIA	I get it Walter.  I get it.
WALTER	What do you get?
MAYOLIA	Your work, the layers of irony.

WALTER	Hello Mayolia.
MAYOLIA	Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
WALTER	With Dead Cat?

MAYOLIA	With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
WALTER	Really?

MAYOLIA	It's like...you've turned on.
WALTER	T-turned on?
MAYOLIA	A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
WALTER	That's really nice of you Mayolia.
MAYOLIA	Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
WALTER	I can't.  I gotta go home.

MAYOLIA	Well, I'll go home with you.
WALTER	Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.

WALTER	I don't think so Mayolia.
MAYOLIA	I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
WALTER	You don't have to do anything!
MAYOLIA	Then let me give you something then...

MAYOLIA	I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
WALTER	Gee.  Thanks.
MAYOLIA	Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.

WALTER	Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
MRS. SWICKER	Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
WALTER	Oh, OK.
MRS. SWICKER	Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
WALTER	I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
MRS. SWICKER	If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
WALTER	Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...

WALTER	Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
MRS. SWICKER	What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
WALTER	T-tell him that?
MRS. SWICKER	If you see him.
WALTER	OK Mrs. Swicker.

MRS. SWICKER	Good night Walter...
WALTER	Good night, Mrs. Swicker -

MRS. SWICKER	What's all the noise in here!
WALTER	Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?

MRS. SWICKER	Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
WALTER	I was just straightening up the place.
MRS. SWICKER	Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
WALTER	I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.

MRS. SWICKER	Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
WALTER	Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.

MRS. SWICKER	She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
WALTER	Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!

WALTER	Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
MRS. SWICKER	Well why don't you clean up this dump!

WALTER	I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
MRS. SWICKER	What's the matter with you!

NUKE	You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
ANNIE	I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
NUKE	You said "Crash".
ANNIE	Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
NUKE	You said "Crash".
ANNIE	Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?

NUKE	Yeah maybe you're right.
ANNIE	You see how nice things are when we go slow?

NUKE	Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
ANNIE	You can learn to like it.
NUKE	I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
ANNIE	Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
NUKE	God, I never thought of that.
ANNIE	There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.

ANNIE	I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
NUKE	What?
ANNIE	They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
NUKE	Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
ANNIE	You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
NUKE	Big League pitchers don't use these.
ANNIE	They did when they were in the Carolina League.

NUKE	God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
ANNIE	What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
NUKE	Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
ANNIE	Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
NUKE	Catch?

NUKE	This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
ANNIE	Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
NUKE	Which nostril am I breathing through?

ANNIE	The right nostril.  Good.
NUKE	My right nostril?
ANNIE	There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.

ANNIE	The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
NUKE	I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
ANNIE	The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
NUKE	Switch nostrils?
ANNIE	Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.

ANNIE	You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
NUKE	If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
ANNIE	He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.

NUKE	How was that?
ANNIE	A little better.
NUKE	Gimme the God damn ball!

NUKE	How ya like that?
ANNIE	Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.

NUKE	I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
ANNIE	It's all the same thing.

NUKE	God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
ANNIE	Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.

NUKE	Death is like spring training?
ANNIE	Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?

ANNIE	I'm yours.
NUKE	Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
ANNIE	Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
NUKE	Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
ANNIE	Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?

NUKE	You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
ANNIE	Nuke?!
NUKE	Just till I lose.
ANNIE	Get over here.
NUKE	No.
ANNIE	Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--

ANNIE	I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
NUKE	No, no, it was great.
ANNIE	How 'bout a back rub?
NUKE	No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
ANNIE	I'll tuck you in.
NUKE	You can't seduce me.
ANNIE	I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...

ANNIE	That's my leg.
NUKE	I know what it is.
ANNIE	I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.

NUKE	Fundamentals?
ANNIE	Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.

NUKE	Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
ANNIE	Yes I do...
NUKE	Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
ANNIE	What a nasty thing to say.
NUKE	He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
ANNIE	Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.

NUKE	No!  You're playing with my mind!
ANNIE	I'm trying to play with your body!
NUKE	I knew it--you're seducing me!
ANNIE	Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
NUKE	I think you're real cute.
ANNIE	Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
NUKE	You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.

ANNIE	Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
NUKE	I did.
ANNIE	What'd he say?
NUKE	He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
ANNIE	He did?
NUKE	I'll be back when we lose.

NUKE	We lost.
ANNIE	it's okay..

NUKE	I'd like you to meet my father.
ANNIE	Oh--won't YOU come in?

NUKE	I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
ANNIE	You don't have to...
NUKE	I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
ANNIE	So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--

NUKE	Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
ANNIE	--but you're father's in there!
NUKE	Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--

ANNIE	It's Skip, for you.
NUKE	Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...

NUKE	I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
ANNIE	That's great!
NUKE	How can I possibly thank you?

ANNIE	Well I guess this is it.
NUKE	I won't be needing these anymore.

ANNIE	Neither will I.
NUKE	I think I'm ready for the Show.
ANNIE	Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
NUKE	Don't worry.

ANNIE	--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
MILLIE	I got lured.
ANNIE	You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
MILLIE	I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions.
ANNIE	That's better.  Got the radar ready?

ANNIE	Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
MILLIE	Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place

ANNIE	Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
MILLIE	He's a virgin.

MILLIE	You should be at the game.
ANNIE	No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?

MILLIE	Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
ANNIE	We all deserve to wear white.

CRASH	I'm Crash Davis.
ANNIE	Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
CRASH	I don't dance.
ANNIE	I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.

CRASH	She's dancing with me.
ANNIE	Crash, I didn't think you--
CRASH	I'll learn.  C'mon--

ANNIE	These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
CRASH	Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
ANNIE	Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.

CRASH	After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
ANNIE	What do you believe in?

CRASH	I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
ANNIE	Oh my...  Don't leave...
CRASH	G'night.

ANNIE	Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
CRASH	I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
ANNIE	I'm not interested yet.

ANNIE	See my hips?
CRASH	Yep.
ANNIE	I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
CRASH	When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
ANNIE	But you were pulling your hips last night.
CRASH	So...Wanta make love?

ANNIE	I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
CRASH	What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
ANNIE	Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
CRASH	That's my job too.

ANNIE	Damn.
CRASH	You're pulling your hips out.
ANNIE	But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!

CRASH	Don't tell anybody.
ANNIE	Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
CRASH	247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
ANNIE	Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
CRASH	No.  Please.

ANNIE	Damn.
CRASH	Let me.

CRASH	Your place or mine?
ANNIE	Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
CRASH	Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?

CRASH	Well, Annie, your place or mine?
ANNIE	You got me all confused.
CRASH	A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
ANNIE	I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.

ANNIE	Crash...I want you.
CRASH	Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
ANNIE	He' s confused--
CRASH	Aren't we all?
ANNIE	Don't you think I'm pretty?

CRASH	You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
ANNIE	I want to be had.
CRASH	I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
ANNIE	He won't make love to me anymore.
CRASH	And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
ANNIE	I want you desperately!

CRASH	Who are you?  Do you have a job?
ANNIE	I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
CRASH	And now you wanta teach me?
ANNIE	I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
CRASH	I doubt that.
ANNIE	Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
CRASH	I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
ANNIE	I'm ready for a complicated man.
CRASH	--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
ANNIE	I said when I think about you, I get wet.
CRASH	Annie, I think you should leave.

ANNIE	God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
CRASH	You okay?

CRASH	Why baseball?
ANNIE	I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...

ANNIE	I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
CRASH	Who?
ANNIE	Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
CRASH	What's so great about baseball?
ANNIE	If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!

CRASH	I don't know if I'd go that far.
ANNIE	It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
CRASH	It's possible.
ANNIE	No.
CRASH	Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
ANNIE	Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
CRASH	Why not?
ANNIE	Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!

CRASH	I got released.
ANNIE	I heard already.

ANNIE	...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
CRASH	How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
ANNIE	It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?

ANNIE	What happened?
CRASH	I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.

ANNIE	I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
CRASH	There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
ANNIE	Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
CRASH	Yeah...you a witch?
ANNIE	Not yet.  It takes years of practice...

CRASH	You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
ANNIE	You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
CRASH	Annie---
ANNIE	What?
CRASH	I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
ANNIE	I can do that, too.

ANNIE	Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
JACKSON	Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
ANNIE	Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson

JACKSON	Ninety-five miles an hour.
ANNIE	He looks great, just great!

ANNIE	Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
JACKSON	What's it say?
ANNIE	It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.

ANNIE	Oh dear....easy honey...
JACKSON	Ninety-five miles an hour...

JACKSON	Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
ANNIE	That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.

JACKSON	Ninety-three miles an hour.
ANNIE	He looks wonderful, Jackson...

ANNIE	Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
JACKSON	He'll learn.

NUKE'S FATHER	Ebby's told me a lot about you.
ANNIE	Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?

ANNIE	He's a good student.
NUKE'S FATHER	We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
ANNIE	Praise the Lord, eh?

NUKE'S FATHER	Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
ANNIE	Oh let's not...

NUKE'S FATHER	God bless you.
ANNIE	She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...

EBBY	Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
ANNIE	You got a live arm there.

EBBY	Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
ANNIE	You need a nickname.
EBBY	That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?

ANNIE	Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
EBBY	Which one of us?
ANNIE	Oh both of you, of course...

EBBY	Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
ANNIE	You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.

ANNIE	No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
EBBY	Well shit, then, let's fuck.

ANNIE	No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
EBBY	Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
ANNIE	When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.

ANNIE	No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
EBBY	The socks?  It's cold in here.
ANNIE	You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?

ANNIE	Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
EBBY	Who's he play for?
ANNIE	Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
EBBY	Never heard of 'em.

ANNIE	Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
EBBY	We gonna fuck or what?
ANNIE	Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"

BOBBY	What's that?
JOSE	Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
BOBBY	You a God damn witch?
JOSE	Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
BOBBY	Will that work for me?
JOSE	If you believe in Voodoo.
BOBBY	I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.

JOSE	No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
BOBBY	C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!

CRASH	I got him on the knee!
UMPIRE	You missed him!
CRASH	God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.

UMPIRE	Don't bump me.
CRASH	It was a cocksucking call!
UMPIRE	Did you call me a cocksucker?
CRASH	No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
UMPIRE	You missed the tag!
CRASH	You spit on me!
UMPIRE	I didn't spit on you!
CRASH	You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
UMPIRE	You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
CRASH	You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
UMPIRE	Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
CRASH	Beg me!
UMPIRE	Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
CRASH	Beg me again!
UMPIRE	Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
CRASH	You're a cocksucker!
UMPIRE	You're outta here!

NUKE	Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
CRASH	Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.

CRASH	Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
NUKE	I thought I was--
CRASH	Don't think.

NUKE	Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
CRASH	Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.

CRASH	Why you shaking me off?
NUKE	I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
CRASH	To announce your fucking presence with authority?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
NUKE	But he ain't seen my heat--
CRASH	Awright, meat, give him your heat.

CRASH	Fastball.
NUKE	Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.

CRASH	Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
NUKE	Well, I held it like an egg.
CRASH	An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
NUKE	I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
CRASH	He did know.
NUKE	How?
CRASH	I told him.

NUKE	Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
CRASH	Gimme that.

NUKE	How come you don't like me?
CRASH	'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
NUKE	What do I got?
CRASH	A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.

CRASH	You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
NUKE	I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
CRASH	You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
NUKE	You been in the Majors?
CRASH	Yep.

CRASH	You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
NUKE	God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!

NUKE	This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
CRASH	Naw...
NUKE	Naw?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
CRASH	By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
NUKE	You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
CRASH	I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.

NUKE	You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
CRASH	Go for it.
NUKE	If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
CRASH	I won't have to.

CRASH	Party without me.
NUKE	God--what a Big League move.

NUKE	Can I ask you something?
CRASH	What?
NUKE	What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
CRASH	If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.

NUKE	I was playing naked.
CRASH	I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.

NUKE	Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
CRASH	Annie's a smart lady.

NUKE	I was great, eh?
CRASH	Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
NUKE	Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
CRASH	The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--

NUKE	Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
CRASH	I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
NUKE	Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
CRASH	It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
NUKE	You're the boss.

NUKE	You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
CRASH	Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...

NUKE	I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
CRASH	It's time you started working on your interviews.
NUKE	What do I gotta do?
CRASH	Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.

CRASH	Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
NUKE	Boring.
CRASH	Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
NUKE	Jesus.
CRASH	Write, write--"I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out."

NUKE	...Good Lord willing, things'll work out.
CRASH	Yep.  So how's Annie?

NUKE	She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
CRASH	You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.

CRASH	What's wrong?
NUKE	I'm nervous--my old man's here.

CRASH	Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
NUKE	Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.

NUKE	Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
CRASH	Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...

NUKE	I'm going to the Show.
CRASH	Then go.

NUKE	I'm trying to thank you.
CRASH	Let go of me!

NUKE	Settle what?
CRASH	C ' mon!
NUKE	I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
CRASH	God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.

NUKE	C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
CRASH	You fuck!
NUKE	Why am I a fuck?
CRASH	Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
NUKE	You're a great catcher.
CRASH	Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
NUKE	No.
CRASH	Okay, I'll kick your ass there.

NUKE	I'll take you back to the hotel.
CRASH	You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!

CRASH	Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
NUKE	My right.

CRASH	Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
NUKE	What?
CRASH	If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.

CRASH	Sorry about last night.
NUKE	Forget it.
CRASH	I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
NUKE	No.
CRASH	You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
NUKE	Fear and ignorance.
CRASH	No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
NUKE	I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.

NUKE	Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
CRASH	I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
NUKE	Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.

CRASH	It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
NUKE	Yeah, thanks for everything.

CRASH	Nuke--  Good luck.
NUKE	You too...Meat.

SKIP	Crash Davis?
CRASH	The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.

CRASH	I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
SKIP	'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-

SKIP	We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
CRASH	And where can I go?
SKIP	You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.

CRASH	I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
SKIP	What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?

CRASH	Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
SKIP	Crash, shut the door.

EBBY	Step outside, pal.
CRASH	Love to--

CRASH	I don't believe in fighting.
EBBY	Pussy.
CRASH	Take the first shot at me.
EBBY	I ain't hitting a man first.
CRASH	Hit me in the chest with this...

EBBY	I'd kill ya.
CRASH	From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
EBBY	Don't try me.
CRASH	Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
EBBY	No way.
CRASH	C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--

EBBY	We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
CRASH	Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
EBBY	She's playing with my mind.
CRASH	It's a damn easy thing to play with.

EBBY	Who you calling a "boy"?
CRASH	See ya at the yard, Meat.

NUKE	I gotta go now, Dad.
FATHER	I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
NUKE	No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
FATHER	We'll be praying for you.
NUKE	Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
FATHER	We'll pray anyway.
NUKE	If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--

MILLIE	Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
JIMMY	Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
MILLIE	No.
JIMMY	Can I give you my testimony?
MILLIE	You can do anything you want.  Hop in.

MILLIE	Well tell 'em, honey.
JIMMY	We're getting married.

SKIP	Where's Ebby?
LARRY	Ain't he warning up?
SKIP	No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
LARRY	Better find our bonus baby, eh?

SKIP	Little high.
LARRY	C'mon big 'un, you're okay...

SKIP	He walked eighteen?!
LARRY	It's a league record.
SKIP	Struck out eighteen...
LARRY	League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.

LARRY	Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
SKIP	I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down

LARRY	He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
SKIP	--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
LARRY	But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
SKIP	You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.

LARRY	Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
SKIP	Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.

SKIP	You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
LARRY	We're eight and sixteen.
SKIP	Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?

LARRY	Eight and twenty-four.
SKIP	Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
LARRY	It's a miracle.
SKIP	Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?

SKIP	Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
LARRY	...and one helluva guy.

SKIP	Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
LARRY	I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
SKIP	I'm getting too old for this game.

SKIP	Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
LARRY	He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
SKIP	Okay...

SKIP	What the hell's going on out there?
LARRY	It's a damn convention.
SKIP	Check it out.

SKIP	The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
LARRY	Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
SKIP	I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--

SANDY	What'you want, kid?
NUKE	Jim looking for somebody.
SANDY	Who ain't?
NUKE	Looking for Crash Davis.
SANDY	Ain't here.
NUKE	I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
SANDY	Your breaking ball's getting better but ya need a change up.

TONY	Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
NUKE	Where does he go?
TONY	Well, I'd rather not say.
NUKE	They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.

TONY	Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
NUKE	He goes to a whorehouse every night?
TONY	Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.

AGENT HADLEY	We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
SAMI	So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
AGENT HADLEY	Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.

AGENT HADLEY	Agent Hadley.
SAMI	Do you know who this is?
AGENT HADLEY	Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
SAMI	If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.

SAMI	What are you doing?
AGENT HADLEY	You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
SAMI	Wired?    I ain't wired.

AGENT HADLEY	Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
SAMI	You killed her!
AGENT HADLEY	No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
SAMI	Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
AGENT HADLEY	You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
SAMI	Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
AGENT HADLEY	Where are the tapes?
SAMI	I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
AGENT HADLEY	A pass.
SAMI	A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
AGENT HADLEY	Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
SAMI	They don't have a murder weapon?
AGENT HADLEY	No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?

SAMI	You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
AGENT HADLEY	I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
SAMI	You didn't have to kill Sophie.
AGENT HADLEY	Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
SAMI	What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
AGENT HADLEY	When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
SAMI	And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.

SAMI	What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
AGENT HADLEY	Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?

SAMI	You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
AGENT HADLEY	I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
SAMI	You didn't have to kill Sophie.
AGENT HADLEY	Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.

SOPHIE	Zero.   That's all I know.
AGENT HADLEY	You'll never get out of the city.

AGENT HADLEY	This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
SOPHIE	Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
AGENT HADLEY	I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
SOPHIE	They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
AGENT HADLEY	Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
SOPHIE	I thought you wanted Zammito?
AGENT HADLEY	What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.

AGENT HADLEY	Too many people know about my involvement in this.
SOPHIE	Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.

WAYNE	Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
AGENT HADLEY	Not today.   Where are your friends?
WAYNE	They left about a half hour ago.
AGENT HADLEY	Where did they go?
WAYNE	I dunno.

WAYNE	Hey man, you can't do that!
AGENT HADLEY	What?   This?

WAYNE	Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
AGENT HADLEY	I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
WAYNE	I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.

BASTALDI	Hello?
MARCEL	It's Elvis...
BASTALDI	Who?
MARCEL	It's me...
BASTALDI	Marcel?

MARCEL	Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
BASTALDI	You're there now?
MARCEL	Oui.
BASTALDI	You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
MARCEL	No.
BASTALDI	You're calling me on is phone?
MARCEL	Oui.
BASTALDI	My number's going to show up on his bill!
MARCEL	Should I call you back?

BASTALDI	You've already robbed the safe?
MARCEL	Oui.
BASTALDI	Take what you've got and get out of there.

DANIEL	Where's your brother?
BASTALDI	Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?

BASTALDI	Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
DANIEL	Uh, yeah.
BASTALDI	Good.   I have a job for you in America.

BASTALDI	Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
DANIEL	C'mon, Laurant, America?
BASTALDI	The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.

BASTALDI	I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
DANIEL	What?
BASTALDI	This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
DANIEL	You don't trust me?
BASTALDI	I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.

BASTALDI	Hello?
DANIEL	It's Daniel.
BASTALDI	Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
DANIEL	-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
BASTALDI	A million! I don't have that kind of money.
DANIEL	Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
BASTALDI	I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
DANIEL	Well, you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.

BOBBY BEANS	Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
ZAMMITO	Good.   I'm good.
BOBBY BEANS	Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
ZAMMITO	When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.

ZAMMITO	Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
BOBBY BEANS	No thank you.
ZAMMITO	You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
BOBBY BEANS	I'm good.   Really.
ZAMMITO	Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
BOBBY BEANS	Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
ZAMMITO	-- Super what?
BOBBY BEANS	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
ZAMMITO	Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
BOBBY BEANS	I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
ZAMMITO	Okay.   How much?
BOBBY BEANS	I'm not here to negotiate.
ZAMMITO	Why are you here?
BOBBY BEANS	To tell you that we're interested in the property.
ZAMMITO	You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
BOBBY BEANS	I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
ZAMMITO	Yeah -- you do that.

BONANNO	Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
ZAMMITO	No, I'm good, Angelo.

BONANNO	I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
ZAMMITO	Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
BONANNO	And?
ZAMMITO	And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
BONANNO	He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
ZAMMITO	He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
BONANNO	Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
ZAMMITO	I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.

BONANNO	They're gonna be what?
ZAMMITO	Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
BONANNO	Good word.

ZAMMITO	Someone else coming?
BONANNO	Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
ZAMMITO	Uh, no --
BONANNO	You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
ZAMMITO	You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.

BONANNO	Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
ZAMMITO	He missed three weeks.
BONANNO	Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
ZAMMITO	I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
BONANNO	But you were there?
ZAMMITO	Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.

BONANNO	Why didn't you tell me about this?
ZAMMITO	You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.

BONANNO	They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
ZAMMITO	Yes.
BONANNO	What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
ZAMMITO	Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
BONANNO	We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?

BONANNO	Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
DANIEL	I guess we're going to find out.
BONANNO	You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
DANIEL	Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?

DANIEL	I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
BONANNO	I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
DANIEL	He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
BONANNO	I assume you want something?
DANIEL	We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
BONANNO	You want me to help you get out of the country?

BONANNO	And for my help I would get what?
DANIEL	Half the tapes.
BONANNO	And the other half?
DANIEL	I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
BONANNO	I only have your word for that.
DANIEL	I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
BONANNO	Where are you staying?

BONANNO	I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
DANIEL	How about if I call you?

BONANNO	This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
DANIEL	Thank you.
BONANNO	You have something for me?

DANIEL	Tonight?
SOPHIE	I know they won't be home tonight.

SOPHIE	I don't know.
DANIEL	If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.

DANIEL	For what?
SOPHIE	Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
DANIEL	What kind of business?
SOPHIE	Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.

DANIEL	You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
RAYMOND	You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.

DANIEL	Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
RAYMOND	No problem.

RAYMOND	Yeah.   We just go home.
DANIEL	We can't.
RAYMOND	I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.

RAYMOND	No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
DANIEL	We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.

DANIEL	Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
RAYMOND	She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --

RAYMOND	Why not just steal another one?
DANIEL	Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.

DANIEL	Get that, will you?
RAYMOND	Why do I always have to answer the phone?
DANIEL	Because you're the closest.
RAYMOND	I'm not any closer than you are.

DANIEL	Why is everything an argument with you?
RAYMOND	I'm just setting my boundaries.

DANIEL	Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
RAYMOND	Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
DANIEL	Jesus!

DANIEL	In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
ZERO	Where are you from?

DANIEL	Hopefully no one.
ZERO	No one? Then why is Zero here?

DANIEL	I just want you there in case there's trouble.
ZERO	And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
DANIEL	We'll see.

DANIEL	He said to go fuck yourself.
ZERO	We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.

ZERO	We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
DANIEL	Cops?

DANIEL	Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
ZERO	You want Zero to kill him?
DANIEL	I'm going to kill him myself!
ZERO	What about the money?

DANIEL	Bring me the scissors.
ZERO	And the Vodka.

DANIEL	Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
ZERO	And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.

DANIEL	Turn on the flashlight.
JULIEN	I'm trying.    It doesn't work.

JULIEN	Do they come with batteries?
DANIEL	You didn't buy batteries?
JULIEN	I thought they came with batteries.
DANIEL	I can't believe you didn't check.
JULIEN	I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
DANIEL	Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.

DANIEL	Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
JULIEN	What for?
DANIEL	We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.

JULIEN	That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
DANIEL	We'll think of something.

DANIEL	Besides, we don't know the city and--
MARCEL	Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!

MARCEL	You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
DANIEL	I think he's already figured that out.

DANIEL	That moron.
MARCEL	It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
DANIEL	Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.

MARCEL	The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
DANIEL	You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.

DANIEL	Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
MARCEL	No.
DANIEL	You're sure?
MARCEL	I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.

MARCEL	Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
DANIEL	Do I?
MARCEL	This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.

DANIEL	You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
MARCEL	Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.

MARCEL	I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
DANIEL	What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?

DANIEL	We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
MARCEL	We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
DANIEL	I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.

DANIEL	We still have to get out of here.
MARCEL	Maybe if we gave the tapes back --

DANIEL	This is Zero.
SAMI	Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.

SAMI	After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
DANIEL	Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.

SAMI	We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
DANIEL	Good idea.
SAMI	I'll be Elvis and you--

DANIEL	It's not?
SAMI	That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.

SAMI	How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
DANIEL	I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.

SAMI	What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
DANIEL	You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
SAMI	No.   Chicks dig me.

SAMI	They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
DANIEL	You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
SAMI	We have to find Sophie.

SAMI	It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
DANIEL	I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.

SAMI	All right, knock it off.
DANIEL	All you are is a professional ass-kisser.

SAMI	Hadley --
DANIEL	Has to be.

SAMI	It's not your fault, Daniel.
DANIEL	No?

DANIEL	Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
SAMI	Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.

DANIEL	Hello?
SAMI	Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.

SAMI	What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
DANIEL	He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.

SAMI	Anybody hungry?
DANIEL	What'd you get?
SAMI	Some bread and...

SAMI	What?
DANIEL	Can I trust you, Sami?
SAMI	Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
DANIEL	If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
SAMI	No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
DANIEL	You haven't answered my question.
SAMI	Does it really matter what I say?
DANIEL	I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
SAMI	I will.
DANIEL	You better.

SAMI	Did you have to use that much explosive?
DANIEL	I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.

DANIEL	I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
LAMAR	What do you want now?
DANIEL	Guns.   Can you get them?
LAMAR	Man, I can get anything.
DANIEL	Don't bullshit me.
LAMAR	I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
DANIEL	I've got a way with people.
LAMAR	I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
DANIEL	I'm from Belgium.
LAMAR	Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
DANIEL	Why haven't you turned us in?
LAMAR	I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?

LAMAR	And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
DANIEL	How much?
LAMAR	A thousand dollars?
DANIEL	Fine.

LAMAR	Yeah?
DANIEL	It's me.
LAMAR	Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
DANIEL	-- Did you set it up?
LAMAR	Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
DANIEL	We had a deal.
LAMAR	We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
DANIEL	Fine.     Ten o'clock.

DANIEL	There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
LAMAR	What?
DANIEL	I'll tell you when it's time.

LAMAR	Okay, we're square now, right?
DANIEL	There's just one more thing I need you to do.

HECTOR	Maybe you should call the police.
RAPHAEL	Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
HECTOR	I just thought that--
RAPHAEL	-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.

HECTOR	-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
RAPHAEL	Hector, don't interrupt me.
HECTOR	He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
RAPHAEL	I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?

RAPHAEL	Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
HECTOR	Hard to say.

ZAMMITO	What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
JOEY "TWO TONS"	You said don't do it, boss.
ZAMMITO	That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.

JOEY "TWO TONS"	Hey boss, it's not a science.
ZAMMITO	Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.

ZAMMITO	They were all French guys.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	French guys?    You mean like from France?
ZAMMITO	Yeah, French guys from France.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	What'd they take?
ZAMMITO	Everything.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Everything?
ZAMMITO	Everything.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Boy, you must be pissed.
ZAMMITO	Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
ZAMMITO	You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Okay boss.   Where are they?
ZAMMITO	If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
JOEY "TWO TONS"	You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
ZAMMITO	Just find them!
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Okay boss.

JOEY "TWO TONS"	But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
ZAMMITO	Oh, I'm sorry.

ZAMMITO	Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Good song though.
ZAMMITO	Great fuckin' song.

JOEY "TWO TONS"	What'd you guys find?
UNIFORMED COP	Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	And the other car?
UNIFORMED COP	Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
UNIFORMED COP	No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
UNIFORMED COP	A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.

JOEY "TWO TONS"	What hotel?
UNIFORMED COP	The Holiday Hotel.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	What room number?
UNIFORMED COP	I don't know.     I didn't look.
JOEY "TWO TONS"	Go look.

MARCEL	The map said to go left.
JULIEN	Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
MARCEL	Oh yeah.

MARCEL	There has to be.
JULIEN	I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
MARCEL	There must be half a million dollars here though.

JULIEN	What do we do?
MARCEL	I was told to take what we have and go.
JULIEN	Go where?   The police are outside.

SOPHIE	They don't have a wine list.
JULIEN	Oh, then we will have the house wine.

SOPHIE	There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
JULIEN	I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.

JULIEN	What about transportation?
SOPHIE	You can use my car.

SOPHIE	No, I didn't.
JULIEN	Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
SOPHIE	Yes.
JULIEN	And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
SOPHIE	No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.

SAMI	I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
JULIEN	What is it you do, Sami?
SAMI	You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
JULIEN	I see.   A master criminal.
SAMI	Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.

SAMI	They don't serve wine here.
JULIEN	What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
SAMI	This kind.
JULIEN	Okay.    I will have a beer.

JULIEN	I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
SAMI	C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.

SAMI	No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
JULIEN	This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.

JULIEN	I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
SAMI	Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.

JULIEN	This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
SAMI	Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
JULIEN	Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
SAMI	We've got to get out of here.
JULIEN	That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?

JULIEN	Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
SAMI	It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.

JULIEN	Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
RAYMOND	She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.

RAYMOND	I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
JULIEN	Relax. It will be fine.

JULIEN	I'll drive.
RAYMOND	I'm the driver.
JULIEN	I've never driven a Cadillac before.

JULIEN	This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
RAYMOND	This is the only American car you've ever driven.

RAYMOND	I knew I should have driven.
JULIEN	Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.

JULIEN	When we get to the next corner jump out.
RAYMOND	I'm not going to leave you.
JULIEN	We both know I'm already dead.

RAYMOND	A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
MARCEL	Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
RAYMOND	There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
MARCEL	What the hell is he talking about?
RAYMOND	I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
MARCEL	How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?

MARCEL	No.   How much?
RAYMOND	I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.

MARCEL	How about Canada?
RAYMOND	What are we going to do, take a taxi?

MARCEL	Going somewhere?
SAMI	Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.

MARCEL	Today's your lucky day, Sami.
SAMI	Yeah, I can see that.
MARCEL	Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
SAMI	Me?
MARCEL	You lived there. You know the city.
SAMI	I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.

MARCEL	-- I want to be Elvis.
SAMI	It's my idea.
MARCEL	C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
SAMI	Okay.   You can be Elvis.

SAMI	We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
MARCEL	Mr. Taylor?
SAMI	No, that's not Mr. Taylor.

MARCEL	Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?

SAMI	Vase with twelve Sunflowers.
MARCEL	Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.

SAMI	You guys used to work together?
MARCEL	Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.

SAMI	It's good.
MARCEL	God, I want to go home.
SAMI	Hey, you know you can't this in France.

SAMI	This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
MARCEL	The baseball is mine.
SAMI	No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!

MARCEL	Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
SAMI	No.
MARCEL	Give it to me, Sami.
SAMI	No!

ZAMMITO	How's my brother?
NICKY "THE RAKE"	He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
ZAMMITO	I said a clean break.

NICKY "THE RAKE"	Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
ZAMMITO	Get in the car.
NICKY "THE RAKE"	Just tell me who's closer to the wall?

ZAMMITO	What happened?
NICKY "THE RAKE"	They sort of got away.
ZAMMITO	I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.

RAPHAEL	Anybody know about that car outside?
ZAMMITO	Yeah.   It's mine.
RAPHAEL	No.   It's mine.
ZAMMITO	The hell it is.
RAPHAEL	I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
ZAMMITO	And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
RAPHAEL	Fuck you, grease-ball!
ZAMMITO	Fuck me?   Fuck you!

RAYMOND	Mr. Zammito?
VINNY	Uh huh.
RAYMOND	I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
VINNY	I don't know what you're talking about.
RAYMOND	I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
VINNY	How?
RAYMOND	You see that car?

VINNY	Yeah.
RAYMOND	It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
VINNY	No shit?
RAYMOND	The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.

RAYMOND	I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
WAYNE	No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
RAYMOND	No thank you.

RAYMOND	Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
WAYNE	Yeah, I dig him.
RAYMOND	Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?

RAYMOND	How are we going to do that?
WAYNE	I know where she went.

RAYMOND	I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
WAYNE	Cool.

SAMI	He speaks about himself in the third person?
RAYMOND	Feel free to correct him if you want.

SAMI	I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
RAYMOND	Watch this.

RAYMOND	I think we went the wrong way.
SAMI	Oh, you think?

SAMI	Holy shit.
RAYMOND	What?

RAYMOND	How do we know what room she's in?
SAMI	Wait here.

RAYMOND	The money isn't here.
SAMI	Where is it, Sophie?

SAMI	I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
RAYMOND	It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.

SAMI	You're not helping.
RAYMOND	Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.

SAMI	I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
RAYMOND	He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?

RAYMOND	The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
SAMI	I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
RAYMOND	J&amp;B?
SAMI	Glenmorangie.
RAYMOND	Glenmorangie is very good.

SAMI	Algeria.
ZERO	And you don't speak French?
SAMI	Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
ZERO	-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?

SAMI	You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
ZERO	Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.

SAMI	I can't even hear myself think.
ZERO	How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?

SAMI	They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
ZERO	What does arresting us get them?
SAMI	You wanna tell him?

SAMI	It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
ZERO	We don't know that for sure.

ZERO	And how do we do that?
SAMI	I don't know.

ZERO	They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
SAMI	He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.

SOPHIE	I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
SAMI	Thanks.

SAMI	When do we go?
SOPHIE	Tonight.

SAMI	You ever hear of jet lag?
SOPHIE	Take a nap.

SOPHIE	You like shoes?
SAMI	No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
SOPHIE	It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.

SOPHIE	So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
SAMI	Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
SOPHIE	The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
SAMI	So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
SOPHIE	They're not nice people.

SOPHIE	Casandra. Old girlfriend?
SAMI	Something like that.
SOPHIE	Did she break your heart?
SAMI	Something like that.
SOPHIE	It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
SAMI	You ask a lot of questions.
SOPHIE	That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
SAMI	I don't remember.    I was drunk.
SOPHIE	You got it in a bar?
SAMI	No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
SOPHIE	Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
SAMI	It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
SOPHIE	I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.

SAMI	Who's gonna see it there?
SOPHIE	The lucky ones.

SOPHIE	Can't sleep?
SAMI	No.
SOPHIE	I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
SAMI	It's not your fault.

SOPHIE	What are you doing?
SAMI	I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
SOPHIE	Sounds boring.
SAMI	It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.

SAMI	I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
SOPHIE	After last night I could say the same for you.

SAMI	Who are you waiting for?
SOPHIE	Stick around and find out.

SAMI	Why?
SOPHIE	Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.

VINNY	Frankie, I --
ZAMMITO	-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.

VINNY	Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
ZAMMITO	That's why we're only breaking one arm.

ZAMMITO	She seems pleasant enough.
VINNY	She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
ZAMMITO	That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.

ZAMMITO	So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
VINNY	You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
ZAMMITO	Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
VINNY	Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
ZAMMITO	I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
VINNY	A little?
ZAMMITO	Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
VINNY	You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
ZAMMITO	What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.

ZAMMITO	What's this?
VINNY	A car.
ZAMMITO	Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
VINNY	It's for you.
ZAMMITO	For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
VINNY	I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
ZAMMITO	Okay.    Okay.
VINNY	I'll get you the papers tomorrow.

BOB	You understand what you'll be doing?
DAVE	Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
BOB	Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
DAVE	`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
BOB	Don't say a .
DAVE	Right.

DAVE	Uh --Mr. Alexander?
BOB	What?
DAVE	Is this dangerous or anything?
BOB	No more than the usual.
DAVE	The usual...

BOB	How much do you usually get paid?
DAVE	Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?

DAVE	First Lady...
BOB	Don't worry.  You won't even see her.

BOB	They barely talk anymore.
DAVE	You're kidding?
BOB	It happens.  This is where you'll be sleeping.

DAVE	Holy cow.
BOB	We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
DAVE	Oh... Okay.

BOB	Now, remember -- keep it simple.
DAVE	Don't worry.

DAVE	What's with her?
BOB	Don't worry about it.

BOB	Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
DAVE	And we're going away for a holiday.
BOB	For a month.
DAVE	A month.
BOB	Right and don't embellish.
DAVE	I promise.  I won't.

BOB	First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
DAVE	Great.

BOB	I'm not certain about...
DAVE	Oh, sure.  Remember the convention speech?

BOB	Dave...
DAVE	It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...

BOB	Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
DAVE	... Alright.
BOB	Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
DAVE	`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'

BOB	Mr. President...
DAVE	I mean,  if it's a problem...

BOB	What the hell is this?
DAVE	What the hell is this ?

BOB	The Washington Post.
DAVE	No...

DAVE	That shelter was in this bill.
BOB	Alan
DAVE	Lots of shelters were in this bill.
BOB	) Listen, you little...

BOB	Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
DAVE	Well it's a last minute change.

BOB	.. Nothing.
DAVE	Great.

BOB	Choices???
DAVE	Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,

BOB	What do you think you're doing?!
DAVE	You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
BOB	Share...

BOB	You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
DAVE	I'm... not... nobody...
BOB	You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
DAVE	Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.

BOB	... what?
DAVE	I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.

BOB	Oh... I'm fired?
DAVE	Yeah.

BOB	You're fired.
DAVE	Fine...

BOB	Fine?
DAVE	Fine.

BOB	Die, you pond scum!
DAVE	I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.

REED	They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
BOB	I can't believe he'd do this.
REED	I know.

BOB	Where's the girl?
REED	She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
BOB	Nightmare...
REED	Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
BOB	Don't call the Vice President!
REED	... What?
BOB	Just don't call him, Alan!
REED	The guy's in a coma, Bob.
BOB	I don't give a shit.
REED	Bob...
BOB	This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!

REED	Till what?
BOB	TilT we figure something out.
REED	Bob, the guy had a stroke!

BOB	Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
REED	Like how?
BOB	Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
REED	Mild stroke?
BOB	Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
REED	Up and around?  Soon?
BOB	Soon.

BOB	A condition...
REED	Exactly. A condition.

BOB	We think so.
REED	Yes.

REED	Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
BOB	It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.

REED	You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
BOB	I was a senator, you know.
REED	Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
BOB	What about containment, Alan?

REED	I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
BOB	Is that everybody?
REED	Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
BOB	What about her.
REED	Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
BOB	And...
REED	I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
BOB	Fine.
REED	Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
BOB	I just hope this yutz can pull it off.

REED	Clean.
BOB	What do you mean, he's clean?

REED	I mean I've checked everything. Women.  Liquor... Finances.  I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
BOB	No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
REED	The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.

BOB	What about the wife?
REED	Clean.
BOB	Check his kids.
REED	Clean.
BOB	Nobody's got clean kids.
REED	We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
BOB	If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
REED	You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!

REED	Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
BOB	Are you out of your mind?

REED	Uh, let me get back to you...
BOB	You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
REED	It's a homeless shelter.
BOB	Oh.  Excuse me.
REED	It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
BOB	I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
REED	Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?

BOB	When does it break?
REED	Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
BOB	Alan, we still have to control this guy...
REED	And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
BOB	You're kidding.
REED	How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
BOB	Three years.
REED	I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.

BOB	No!...  WE didn't anything...
REED	Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...

BOB	What's with the cameras?
REED	Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
BOB	Oh.  Fine.

BOB	Do we have anything on the budget today?
REED	I don't think so.

REED	What are you gonna do?
BOB	I'm going to kill him.
REED	You can't kill a President.

BOB	He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
REED	Bob...
BOB	I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
REED	He's only doing what you told him to.
BOB	What I told him to?
REED	I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
BOB	Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
REED	He was only doing his job.

BOB	It's not his job -- It's my job!
REED	Bob...
BOB	Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
REED	Don't do this.
BOB	I'll lock him away for good.
REED	Then we'll all go to jail together.

BOB	What do you mean by that?
REED	Just what you think I mean.
BOB	Are you threatening me?
REED	Sort of... Yeah.

REED	Uh-oh...
BOB	... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
REED	Jesus...

DAVE	So you want to go swimming?
MURRAY	Dave -- I'm working.
DAVE	Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
MURRAY	I was gonna do something with Joan.
DAVE	Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.

MURRAY	I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
DAVE	It's fine.
MURRAY	They could put you in jail.
DAVE	Why would they do that.  They hired me.

DAVE	I don't think so
MURRAY	This is undeclared income.
DAVE	And who's gonna find out?
MURRAY	The government
DAVE	I am the government.

MURRAY	I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
DAVE	I'm not sure.

MURRAY	I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
DAVE	I'm not sure.
MURRAY	I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
DAVE	I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
MURRAY	Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
DAVE	Choices?
MURRAY	You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
DAVE	You could buy it on payments.
MURRAY	Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
DAVE	So what do we do?
MURRAY	Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
DAVE	It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.

DAVE	Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
MURRAY	That'd be great.
DAVE	Well -- take care.

REED	You sure?  A Coke or a Perrier or something?
DAVE	Oh yeah... 1'm fine...

REED	Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
DAVE	Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
REED	We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?

REED	In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
DAVE	Extend things?
REED	Extend them.  C'mere for a second.

DAVE	Oh my God...
REED	I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
DAVE	What happened?
REED	Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...

REED	It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
DAVE	Oh my gosh...

DAVE	Will he be alright?
REED	Oh, yeah... probably...

DAVE	No.
REED	I'm afraid so.
DAVE	Really?   Crazy?

REED	You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
DAVE	I'm not sure... I might have.
REED	Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
DAVE	Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
REED	Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
DAVE	In the car?
REED	In the car.
DAVE	I see what you mean.

REED	Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
DAVE	A teleprompter.
REED	What?

DAVE	The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
REED	I don't think so.
DAVE	Oh.

DAVE	Presence.
REED	Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
DAVE	At a press conference.
REED	What?
DAVE	That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.

REED	Thanks, I wrote it.
DAVE	... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
REED	Dave...
DAVE	'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...

REED	Dave!
DAVE	'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'

DAVE	I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
REED	It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
DAVE	Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
REED	She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.

REED	Fine.
DAVE	Fine.

DAVE	Gimme a quarter.
REED	What?
DAVE	Quick.  Gimme a quarter.

REED	President vetoes works bill?
DAVE	We vetoed that?

REED	Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
DAVE	But we went there.  We saw those kids.

DAVE	Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
REED	Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.

DAVE	What do you mean you made it all up?
REED	We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
DAVE	This is wrong, Alan!
REED	Wrong...
DAVE	Alan...
REED	Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.

DAVE	We've got to fix this.
REED	Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...

REED	`Dave'?
DAVE	She knows.

DAVE	Now he's making stuff up about me.
REED	He's not.

SECRETARY OF COMMERCE	Yes, Mr. President?
DAVE	You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE	And it's proving quite effective...
DAVE	Does it make the cars any better?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE	No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
DAVE	Perceptual?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE	Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
DAVE	Why?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE	Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
DAVE	So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE	Yes, but I wouldn't...
DAVE	Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?

NANCE	This is from the people of Burundi...
DAVE	Oh... Thanks.
NANCE	And these are a gift from the King of To go.

DAVE	What are they?
NANCE	Fertility beads.
DAVE	Ah.

NANCE	Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
DAVE	Certainly.

DAVE	Something like what...
NANCE	Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
DAVE	The Fidelity nonsense...
NANCE	All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
DAVE	They re not my attack dogs.
NANCE	What do you mean?
DAVE	I just fired Bob Alexander.

DAVE	Oh... Hi.
NANCE	Dirty business we're in sometimes.
DAVE	Yeah.
NANCE	He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.

DAVE	... Sometimes they do.
NANCE	Yeah... Sometimes they do.

DAVE	You ever think back to how you started.
NANCE	What?
DAVE	You know.  Your first campaign.

NANCE	One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
DAVE	Really?
NANCE	My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.

NANCE	How'd you get started?
DAVE	Oh... Kinda the same way.

DAVE	Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
DUANE	Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
DAVE	You're not?
DUANE	No.

DUANE	Your government needs your help.
DAVE	What?
DUANE	On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.

DAVE	Really?
DUANE	We'd like to hire you.
DAVE	Really?

DAVE	So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
DUANE	I can't say.
DAVE	You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
DUANE	I can't say.
DAVE	Oh.

DAVE	So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
DUANE	Yeah.
DAVE	You got a gun?
DUANE	Of course.

DAVE	You ever use it?
DUANE	No.
DAVE	Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
DUANE	What about it?
DAVE	Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
DUANE	Certainly.

DAVE	Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
DUANE	But it's ten-thirty at night.

DAVE	I was waiting for that jack.
DUANE	I had a feeling.

DUANE	You mean with you and everything?
DUANE	`Bleed for your king.'
DAVE	What's that?
DUANE	First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
DAVE	You're kidding.
DUANE	No... They don't kid.

DAVE	But Bill was your king, not Bob.
DUANE	Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...

DAVE	Didn't mean to bum you out.
DUANE	That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
DAVE	Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.

DAVE	Who?
DUANE	The Vice-President...
DAVE	Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...

DAVE	Well...
DUANE	Well...

DUANE	You sure you don't want a lift back home?
DAVE	No thanks.  It's not that far.

DUANE	I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
DAVE	Thanks, Duane.

ELLEN	What are you staring at?
DAVE	Uh...

DAVE	Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
ELLEN	Go tuck yourself, Bill.

DAVE	You bet.
ELLEN	I'm outta here.

ELLEN	Don't you have anything to say to me?
DAVE	Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
ELLEN	You don't change, do you, Bill?

DAVE	What?
ELLEN	Since when do you care about the homeless?

DAVE	I care about the homeless.
ELLEN	Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.

DAVE	... How could I what?
ELLEN	Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!

ELLEN	... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
DAVE	I don't understand.
ELLEN	That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
DAVE	What's wrong with a magic trick?
ELLEN	You made their funding disappear!

DAVE	Look.  If there was some mistake...
ELLEN	There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.

DAVE	... . Ellen.
ELLEN	I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
DAVE	Oh... Yeah.
ELLEN	Mind if I sit down?
DAVE	No.

ELLEN	That was quite a thing you did today.
DAVE	Anybody would have done it.
ELLEN	Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.

ELLEN	Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
DAVE	Oh yeah?  Me, too.
ELLEN	You weren't in the state legislature.

ELLEN	I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
DAVE	I don't know.

ELLEN	When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
DAVE	They asked me to help.
ELLEN	I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?

DAVE	You're leaving?
ELLEN	I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
DAVE	Where are you going?
ELLEN	Home.

DAVE	Where's home?
ELLEN	Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.

DAVE	Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
ELLEN	You1re leaving, too?
DAVE	I never wanted to hurt anybody.  In fact... I even thought I was helping.

DAVE	How were you gonna get home?
ELLEN	I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.

ELLEN	You sure this goes somewhere?
DAVE	Truman used it all the time.

ELLEN	You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
DAVE	I don't mind.
ELLEN	Thanks.

DAVE	He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
ELLEN	Oh... Okay.

DAVE	What?
ELLEN	It's just so strange...

ELLEN	I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
DAVE	I'm not Bill Mitchell.

DAVE	In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
ELLEN	He wasn't always like that, anyway.

DAVE	Are you hungry?
ELLEN	What?
DAVE	I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.

ELLEN	I really don't have much of an appetite.
DAVE	Just wait.

DAVE	That's a secret.
ELLEN	You have a lot of secrets.
DAVE	I guess.

ELLEN	So what do you do the rest of the time?
DAVE	You mean when I'm not running the country?
ELLEN	Yes.
DAVE	I run a temp agency.

DAVE	You know, secretaries and stiff.
ELLEN	You find people jobs?
DAVE	Yeah.  Is that funny?
ELLEN	It's just more than anybody else does around here.
DAVE	Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.

ELLEN	You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
DAVE	I know.
ELLEN	But you could go to jail for it.

DAVE	It was okay?
ELLEN	It was inspirational.

DAVE	Well I guess...
ELLEN	Yeah... Bedtime.

DAVE	What?
ELLEN	I can't.
DAVE	I know. I'm sorry...
ELLEN	I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
DAVE	That's okay.

DAVE	What's wrong?
ELLEN	Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.

ELLEN	They're crucifying you out there.
DAVE	Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
ELLEN	You really believe that?
DAVE	Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
ELLEN	I sure fall for some weird guys.

ELLEN	Yeah.   He's a good man.
DAVE	What?

ELLEN	Hi.
DAVE	Hi.
ELLEN	) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
DAVE	It's nice.

DAVE	I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
ELLEN	Yeah, well... It's finally over.

DAVE	I never thought I'd...
ELLEN	I know.
DAVE	I missed...
ELLEN	... Me, too.

ELLEN	So this is it?
DAVE	... Not exactly the Oval Office.
ELLEN	Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.

DAVE	It could be fun.
ELLEN	Yeah... It could be fun.

REED	I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  The `Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet.  We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
MITCHELL	Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...

MITCHELL	The Monroe?
REED	Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...

MITCHELL	Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
REED	We're working on it.
MITCHELL	Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
REED	We're doing our best, sir.

REED	We're all set,  sir.
MITCHELL	What about the intro?
REED	It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
MITCHELL	It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.

MITCHELL	Who's this priest I'm thanking?
REED	Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
MITCHELL	Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
REED	All set.
MITCHELL	Fabulous.

ED	No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
AL	What if--you're vomiting?
ED	What if I'm vomiting?
AL	Do they show it?
ED	I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --

ED	I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
AL	No! Do they show you having sex?
ED	No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
AL	At what point?
ED	At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.

ED	Yeah. I brought you some movies.
AL	Anything good?

ED	No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
ED	Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
AL	She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
ED	Yeah. Ma...

AL	What do you love her or something?
ED	Come on...
AL	Look at your face. I had a car that color.

AL	Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
ED	Who?
AL	Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
ED	Yeah, so... ?
AL	They celebrated the common person.
ED	Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
AL	No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.

AL	Jeanette, you're hurting me.
ED	I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...

AL	Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
ED	No.
AL	Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.

AL	How's your mother?
ED	Al!
AL	Our neighbors gave me a ride.
ED	Al!!
AL	Where is she? Is she all right?

AL	You thought it was me?
ED	Yes!
AL	It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
ED	Went --

ED	Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
AL	I'm moving out.
ED	What?!
AL	I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
ED	Oh, Al ... This is just...
AL	Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.

TAD	Did you see that?
BARRY	What?
TAD	Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
BARRY	You're nuts.
TAD	Okay, I'm nuts.

TAD	I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
BARRY	What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
TAD	You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
BARRY	This is real, Bananahead!
TAD	So?
BARRY	So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.

BARRY	You think she really likes him?
TAD	She doesn't give a shit about him.
BARRY	You know what would be great?
TAD	What?
BARRY	If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.

BARRY	Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
TAD	Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
BARRY	You know it.

CYNTHIA	What did you study?
ED	Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?

CYNTHIA	Ed, can I see you a second.
ED	Excuse me.
CYNTHIA	Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
ED	Cool.
CYNTHIA	I want you to take this.

CYNTHIA	That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
ED	Um, yeah -- thanks.

CYNTHIA	Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
ED	No, uh...
CYNTHIA	I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
ED	Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
CYNTHIA	I do.

CYNTHIA	Yes, Ed.
ED	Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
CYNTHIA	Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?

CYNTHIA	How you doing, Ed?
ED	I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
CYNTHIA	Uh-huh?
ED	And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.

ED	Yeah?
CYNTHIA	Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
ED	Sure.
CYNTHIA	A woman wants to be pursued.

ED	They tore her dress! ...
CYNTHIA	We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
ED	Yeah?!
CYNTHIA	That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
ED	Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.

CYNTHIA	Yeah.
ED	You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
CYNTHIA	Great line.
ED	What if Shari's the dream?
CYNTHIA	Ed, do you want my advice?
ED	Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
CYNTHIA	Leave her be.
ED	You said a woman likes to be pursued.
CYNTHIA	Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.

CYNTHIA	Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
ED	Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
CYNTHIA	Ed --
ED	You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
CYNTHIA	Ed --
ED	No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
CYNTHIA	Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.

CYNTHIA	I don't think so.
ED	Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.

CYNTHIA	He's who we want to go with.
SCHARLACH	This guy.
CYNTHIA	I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
SCHARLACH	I'm not sure about the entire concept.

CYNTHIA	Take him off the air.
SCHARLACH	What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
CYNTHIA	I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.

SCHARLACH	With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
CYNTHIA	Good luck.

CYNTHIA	Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
SCHARLACH	Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.

SCHARLACH	Where are you going?
CYNTHIA	I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.

DR. GELLER	Mr. Pekurny.
ED	Yes?
DR. GELLER	I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
ED	Thank you. Can I see her?
DR. GELLER	Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
ED	Mm...  Oh, man...
ED	What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
DR. GELLER	Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
ED	Really? They were..
DR. GELLER	According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
ED	Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
DR. GELLER	I ... don't know. I ...

ED	I thought -- I thought he was dead.
DR. GELLER	Who?
ED	Al!
DR. GELLER	No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.

ED	What?
JOHN	Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
ED	You said that.
JOHN	We're falling behind.

JOHN	You know who we are?
ED	Tell me.
JOHN	We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
ED	I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
JOHN	I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
ED	So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
JOHN	Your brother's here.

JOHN	Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
ED	Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?

ED	Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
JOHN	Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
ED	Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
JOHN	Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?

ED	Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
JOHN	No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
ED	What?

ED	You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
JOHN	When? Today?
ED	No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
JOHN	Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
ED	Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
JOHN	Right, right...
ED	And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
JOHN	Right.
ED	So he killed himself.
JOHN	Oh.

JEANETTE	Eddie? ...
ED	Yeah?
JEANETTE	Are the TV people with you?
ED	Yeah. The camera guy is here.
JEANETTE	Send him away.
ED	Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
JEANETTE	No.
ED	Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
JEANETTE	No. It's a mess.
ED	Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.

ED	Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
JEANETTE	Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
ED	Hey, he cheated on her.
JEANETTE	He made a mistake.
ED	I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
JEANETTE	No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
ED	No! And that girl has a name.

JEANETTE	I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
ED	No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?

ED	How's Marcia? She all right?
JEANETTE	I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
ED	Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
JEANETTE	Mm.
ED	You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
JEANETTE	Oh my God!
ED	I mean, that worked out.
JEANETTE	Oh my God!!

JEANETTE	I can't believe you're taking his side.
ED	I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.

JEANETTE	I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
ED	So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.

JEANETTE	Yes.
ED	Yes to me or yes to the coil?
JEANETTE	Both.
ED	Holy sh--

JEANETTE	He had girlfriends!
ED	He says --
JEANETTE	I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!

JEANETTE	All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
ED	Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
JEANETTE	He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
ED	But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
JEANETTE	She could've been a nurse.
ED	Could've been a nurse?
JEANETTE	She had white shoes.
ED	So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
JEANETTE	What's the difference?
ED	The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.

ED	Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
JEANETTE	He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.

ED	If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
JEANETTE	And what did he come back now for?
ED	Who?
JEANETTE	Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
ED	What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...

JEANETTE	Eddie...
ED	Mom?
JEANETTE	I'm at the hospital.
ED	What's the matter?!
JEANETTE	He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
ED	Oh God. What hospital?
JEANETTE	St. Joseph's.
ED	I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.

ED	What happened?
JEANETTE	It was horrible. He called me up.
ED	Who?
JEANETTE	Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
ED	So you had sex with him?

JEANETTE	What?
ED	The doctor said you were having sex.
JEANETTE	To you? In front of him?  With the...
ED	Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
JEANETTE	Oh my god! On TV!
ED	Why? How...
JEANETTE	One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
ED	But Al is your husband now!
JEANETTE	Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
ED	Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?

JEANETTE	Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
ED	Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!

JEANETTE	Ed! How did you know I was here?
ED	You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
JEANETTE	Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
ED	Ma...
JEANETTE	I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
ED	And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
JEANETTE	I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!

ED	What's going on over there?
RITA	Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.

ED	Right, yeah --
RITA	She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
ED	No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?

RITA	Hi, Mom. 
ED	Shari, Ray feels --

ED	Hi. Is Shari here?
RITA	No.
ED	What is she, at work?
RITA	She left.
ED	Well, when will she be back?

RITA	She won't.
ED	What are you talking about?
RITA	She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
ED	I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
RITA	She wouldn't tell me.

MR. SCHARLACH	Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
ED	All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!

ED	I can't?
MR. SCHARLACH	Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
ED	Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
MR. SCHARLACH	Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
ED	All right. Let them decide.

ED	No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
MARCIA	They're gonna mock our foibles.
ED	Our what?
MARCIA	Our foibles, our foibles!

MARCIA	What are you doing?
ED	Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?

ED	Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
MARCIA	Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
ED	I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."

ED	Are you asking me?
FELICIA	No, I mean...

ED	What does this mean?
FELICIA	It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
ED	He's just ... trying a little too hard --

ED	How much less?
FELICIA	Never would be plenty.
ED	I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.

LOU	Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
ED	What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
LOU	Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
ED	Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
LOU	I batted!
ED	You batted or you bunted?
LOU	Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
ED	Well, then I'm quitting.
LOU	Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
ED	Who's in it?

ED	Hey, Lou.
LOU	Welcome to work, Ed.

SHARI	Yeah...
ED	I hear the dog really liked him.
SHARI	Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
ED	Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.

SHARI	Are you sure about this?
ED	Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
SHARI	Why do it?
ED	I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
SHARI	Cream rinse?
ED	Dynamite.
SHARI	So?
ED	So maybe this is my dynamite.
SHARI	Dynamite is dangerous.

ED	You do though, you look great.
SHARI	Right.
ED	No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.

SHARI	What do you want?!
ED	Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...

SHARI	Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
ED	I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
SHARI	Ha!
ED	Okay ...
SHARI	I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
ED	Oh... how come?

SHARI	I mean bad.
ED	Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.

SHARI	Really?
ED	Yeah.

SHARI	Oh my God.
ED	It's... okay
SHARI	I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
ED	Well, when you put it that way.
SHARI	Leave. Go.
ED	Can't we just --
SHARI	Go!
ED	All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.

SHARI	Really?
ED	Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
SHARI	Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
ED	Really?
SHARI	Oh God, this is so weird.
ED	Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.

SHARI	What are you doing?
ED	I missed you.

ED	You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
SHARI	Yeah, well...

ED	It's really a tremendous turnoff.
SHARI	You should see the one we wear when it rains.
ED	Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
SHARI	The what?
ED	You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
SHARI	Oh yeah.
ED	It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?

ED	Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
SHARI	That's lucky.
ED	Saturday, I think we should

ED	I wish my stepfather was here.
SHARI	Why?
ED	He could give me some oxygen.

SHARI	Um...
ED	What?

ED	I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
SHARI	I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
ED	So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
SHARI	I know, I ...
ED	Shari, I really like you...
SHARI	I really like you too...
ED	...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
SHARI	... yeah, then, but...
ED	So...?
SHARI	Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.

SHARI	I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
ED	Shari...
SHARI	Everybody hates me!
ED	No. Who?
SHARI	Look at this.

SHARI	Page three of the Post.
ED	Ohh...
SHARI	A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
ED	Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
SHARI	Twenty-nine.
ED	Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
SHARI	There's a list.
ED	Really? 
SHARI	Ed?

SHARI	I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
ED	So?
SHARI	So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
ED	Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
SHARI	I'm sorry.
ED	Come on, let's go.
SHARI	Where?
ED	Somewhere.

SHARI	I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
ED	Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
SHARI	Okay.
ED	Come on...

ED	I need to talk.
SHARI	Are you all right?
ED	She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
SHARI	Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
ED	Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
SHARI	...yeah?

ED	It's not their fault.
SHARI	No. It's your fault.

ED	What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
SHARI	No... Could you?
ED	No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
SHARI	The what?
ED	Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
SHARI	What?

ED	You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
SHARI	Everybody's someone.
ED	Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.

SHARI	This is going right up your ass.
ED	Come on.

ED	Kinda'.
SHARI	It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.

SHARI	You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
ED	What did you do to your hair?
SHARI	My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
ED	It's nice.

ED	Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
SHARI	What do we have to do?
ED	My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.

ED	But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
SHARI	So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.

RAY	What's up?
ED	Where were you?
RAY	I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.

ED	What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
RAY	I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.

RAY	You know, that would be like a great thing.
ED	What?
RAY	That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
ED	What are you drunk?
RAY	Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
ED	What is?!
RAY	Show business.
ED	You're in show business?
RAY	Yeah. I service video equipment.
ED	That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
RAY	I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
ED	Thumbsucker!
RAY	I'm making a tape.
ED	We're excited.

RAY	I got your message. Way to go!
ED	Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.

ED	I ... I'm not gonna do it.
RAY	What?
ED	Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
RAY	Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!

ED	You would do this? You would actually --
RAY	In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
ED	Why do you do that?
RAY	What?
ED	Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
RAY	All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
ED	I'm doing all right.
RAY	Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?

RAY	You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
ED	Screw off.
RAY	How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
ED	I don't know.
RAY	That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
ED	Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
RAY	Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.

ED	All right.
RAY	Yeah?!
ED	Yeah.

ED	Polish acrobat.
RAY	Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.

RAY	Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
ED	See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.

RAY	Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
ED	No. What happened?
RAY	That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.

ED	Ray, maybe this isn't ...
RAY	No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
ED	Marcia's living with a singer?
RAY	Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.

RAY	I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
ED	Ray --
RAY	She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
ED	Oh, Jesus.

RAY	Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
ED	What's the dif --
RAY	Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
ED	She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
RAY	Quick pull off the highway is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.

RAY	What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
ED	Great.
RAY	While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.

RAY	Who is it?
ED	It's me, Ed.

RAY	Hi.
ED	You watching the ballgame?
RAY	Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
ED	Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
RAY	Yeah...

RAY	Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
ED	We'd better go...

ED	What is this? What's going on, who is that?
RAY	It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
ED	Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
RAY	Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.

ED	I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
RAY	No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her

ED	Why me?
RAY	You brought the cameras here!
ED	You brought the girl!
RAY	Please!
ED	If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.

ED	... Ray?
RAY	Yeah.
ED	Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
RAY	I know.
ED	Look, we gotta talk.
RAY	Save it.

ED	What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
RAY	Cassie...

RAY	Good-bye, brother!
ED	Ray, come an--

RAY	Cliff left her, thanks to you.
ED	Me?!
RAY	That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
ED	I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.

RAY	Come on, Ma.
ED	Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
RAY	You know what your problem is?
ED	Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
RAY	I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
ED	Me?! That's you!
RAY	I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.

RAY	And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
ED	A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.

WOMAN	Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
ED	Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
ED	Hi, Shari.
WOMAN	Who's Shari?
ED	Who's --

WOMAN	Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
ED	No problema.  You want a picture?

ED	No -- keep it.
WOMAN	I love you! 1 want to marry you!

HANK	Hello.
ED	Hi.

HANK	You don't recognize me.
ED	No. Am I supposed to?

HANK	Who is it?
ED	It's Ed.

HANK	Quite a shithole, isn't it?
ED	It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
HANK	I was in jail.
ED	The whole time? Eighteen years?
HANK	No. Two times.
ED	What...
HANK	Check forging.
ED	Oh, man! So...
HANK	The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
ED	So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
HANK	I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.

ED	All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
HANK	Ed... I'm sorry.
ED	Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
HANK	What...
ED	The pirate ship.

ED	-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
HANK	Do you still have it?
ED	No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.

JILL	That girl's an idiot.
ED	What?... Why?

JILL	Hi.
ED	Hi.

JILL	I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
ED	Thanks... That's ...

ED	Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
JILL	Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.

ED	Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
JILL	Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.

ED	Oh!!
JILL	We have to stop meeting like this.
ED	Hm?

JILL	Are you busy tomorrow night?
ED	No.
JILL	Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
ED	Sure.

ED	Can I help with anything?
JILL	No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
ED	What is? Oh, dinner!

ED	Mm.
JILL	Good?
ED	Mm.

ED	Ohhh...
JILL	Ed?
ED	Ohh... do you own a cat?
JILL	Yeah. Why?

RAY	Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
MARCIA	What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?

RAY	We don't have foibles.
MARCIA	Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.

MARCIA	Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
RAY	That's the point -- this could change things.
MARCIA	How?
RAY	For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
MARCIA	What does that have to do with... ?
RAY	If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.

SHARI	Sign here, please.
WOMAN	That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
SHARI	By the X.
WOMAN	Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
SHARI	What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
WOMAN	Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
SHARI	By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.

MS. HOY	Yo --
CLASS	pierdo.
MS. HOY	Tu
CLASS	pierdes.
MS. HOY	El/ella -
CLASS	pierde.

JIM	A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
JIM	Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
DAVE	She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.

JIM	You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
DAVE	Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...

JIM	You did it at your house?  Your own house?
DAVE	Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
JIM	In love?
DAVE	Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
JIM	But you haven't written your novel.
DAVE	That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
JIM	Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.

DAVE	You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
JIM	That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
DAVE	I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
JIM	I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.

DAVE	Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
JIM	He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.

TRACY	One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
DAVE	You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...

TRACY	what?
DAVE	Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
TRACY	No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
DAVE	I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
TRACY	What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
DAVE	What kind of person?

DAVE	Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
TRACY	Thank you.
DAVE	And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.

TRACY	It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
DAVE	Here, get down.

JIM	Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
DIANE	Anything wrong?
JIM	Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.

JIM	Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
DIANE	Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
JIM	He likes it.

DIANE	You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
JIM	Yeah, uh, just a minute
DIANE	Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
JIM	Yeah, just --
DIANE	Do it!

DIANE	How'd it go?
JIM	Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
DIANE	You guys have fun?

JIM	Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
DIANE	What?
JIM	Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.

DICK	Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
JO	Dick... Dick,..
DICK	What?
JO	Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
DICK	You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!

DICK	Having a problem with your eye there?
JO	Dick.

DICK	All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
JO	So nice

JIM	What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
LARRY	Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
JIM	Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
LARRY	You have the key, Mr. McAllister.

JIM	I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
LARRY	Okay.  Yeah.  We know
JIM	All right.  I'll be back

JIM	What d'you got?
LARRY	I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
JIM	You're kidding, right?
LARRY	I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
JIM	Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.

LARRY	Mr. M.?
JIM	Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.

JIM	Larry?
LARRY	Yeah?
JIM	I think we've got a problem.

JIM	Mostly Tammy fans
LARRY	See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
JIM	He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
LARRY	But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
JIM	It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
LARRY	I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down

JIM	Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
LARRY	But, Mr. M. -

TRACY	Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
JIM	Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
TRACY	You know what they say about the early bird.
JIM	Yes, I do.

JIM	Well, good luck there, Tracy
TRACY	Thanks, Mr. M.

JIM	Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
TRACY	I know.
JIM	Tracy.
TRACY	Ethics are...

JIM	Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
TRACY	...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
JIM	Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.

TRACY	I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
JIM	Hey, that's super
TRACY	Here they are.
JIM	You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
TRACY	Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
JIM	Right

JIM	Looks good to me.
TRACY	Aren't you supposed to keep them?
JIM	NO, that's fine
TRACY	I thought you were supposed to keep them.
JIM	Okay, fine. Sure

TRACY	Thanks for everything.
JIM	You bet.

TRACY	I can't wait to start campaigning.
JIM	Should be easy.  So far no competition.
TRACY	Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
JIM	Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy

TRACY	You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
JIM	Sure
TRACY	Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
JIM	Good luck, Tracy.

TRACY	Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
JIM	So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.

TRACY	You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
JIM	Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
TRACY	Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
JIM	As far as I know, they--

TRACY	These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
JIM	Looks like Tim Kobza.

TRACY	Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
JIM	Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.

JIM	I guess you know why you're here
TRACY	If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
JIM	A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
TRACY	Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!

TRACY	Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
JIM	Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
TRACY	I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
JIM	6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
TRACY	I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
JIM	Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
TRACY	well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.

JIM	You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
TRACY	Why are you lecturing me?
JIM	This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
TRACY	I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
JIM	I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
TRACY	And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.

TRACY	Yes?
JIM	Looks like today's your lucky day

TRACY	What do you mean?
JIM	You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.

TRACY	I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
JIM	That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?

TRACY	Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
JIM	That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.

TRACY	Hello, Mr. M.
JIM	Hello, Tracy.

JIM	So what brings you here?
TRACY	I'm looking at new cars.
JIM	Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
TRACY	My mother's buying me a new car for college.
JIM	Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
TRACY	Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
JIM	Good for you.  Good for you

JIM	So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
TRACY	Sporty.

TRACY	Where to?
JIM	Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.

JIM	Handles pretty good, don't you think?
TRACY	Yeah.
JIM	Plenty of pep, too.
TRACY	Uh-huh.
JIM	And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
TRACY	That sounds good.

JIM	So Tracy?
TRACY	Yes?
JIM	Why are you doing this?
TRACY	Doing what?
JIM	Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
TRACY	Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?

JIM	Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
TRACY	I've got an idea.

JIM	What's this?
TRACY	My house.

TRACY	I want you to do something for me.
JIM	Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
TRACY	I just have to get something. I'll be right back.

JIM	Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
TRACY	Would you sign it for me?

JIM	What a surprise.
TRACY	Take as much room as you want

TRACY	I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
JIM	You'll be fine.
TRACY	I hope so
JIM	You will.

WALT	That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
JIM	Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
WALT	Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.

WALT	Jim, where the hell have you been?
JIM	Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
WALT	Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.

WALT	Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
JIM	Oh yeah, you bet.

JIM	Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
MISS BEEDER	Uh, Jim?
JIM	Hmm?
MISS BEEDER	Walt needs to see you.
JIM	Oh.  Okay.

JIM	Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
MISS BEEDER	Okay, Jim. I understand.
JIM	Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.

TAMMY	You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?
JIM	Just wait outside. Tammy.
TAMMY	Okay.  But is this about the posters?
JIM	Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
TAMMY	Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.

JIM	So... what do you have to tell me?
TAMMY	Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
JIM	What is it. Tammy?
TAMMY	I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
JIM	Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
TAMMY	I did it.
JIM	And when did you do it?
TAMMY	This weekend.
JIM	Exactly when?
TAMMY	I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
JIM	And how did you get in the school?
TAMMY	Door was open.
JIM	Which door?
TAMMY	I don't know. All I know is I did it I
JIM	I don't believe you.
TAMMY	I have proof.

JIM	After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
SHERRY	Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?

SHERRY	Could you get this? I can't
JIM	Sure.

JIM	Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
JIM	Here?
SHERRY	More this way.
JIM	Okay.  Give me the drill.

SHERRY	I can't afford this stuff right now.
JIM	Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
SHERRY	You sure?

JIM	So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
SHERRY	Should we get a what?
JIM	points at the motel.
SHERRY	Oh.

JIM	Shall we give it a name?
SHERRY	Dave.

SHERRY	Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
JIM	No, I... uh, didn't know that
SHERRY	All his life.  He's tried everything.
JIM	Still clear?
SHERRY	Yep.
JIM	We'll let it run awhile

SHERRY	Hey Yeah?
SHERRY	Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
JIM	Right now?
SHERRY	Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
JIM	Three twenty-five.
SHERRY	Three twenty-five.

SHERRY	What do you want, Jim?
JIM	You're there.
SHERRY	Yeah.  I'm here.
JIM	Sherry... I love you.
SHERRY	Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
JIM	It's the only true thing I know anymore.
SHERRY	We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
JIM	A mistake?  That was no mistake.
SHERRY	I was lonely.  You took advantage
JIM	Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --

JIM	Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
PAUL	I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
JIM	I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
PAUL	Yeah.
JIM	But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
PAUL	What do you mean?
JIM	Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?

PAUL	Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
JIM	Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
PAUL	And she's super-nice
JIM	Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
JIM	Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
PAUL	Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
JIM	takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
JIM	Okay, let's say
PAUL	No, wait -- apples.  Apples.

JIM	Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
PAUL	I also like bananas.
JIM	Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.

JIM	Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
PAUL	Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.

PAUL	And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
JIM	Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
PAUL	Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.

PAUL	Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
JIM	Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.

WALT	253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
LARRY	No way I It doesn't make sense.
WALT	Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
LARRY	And 290 "disregards," right?
WALT	If you say so.

WALT	Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
LARRY	I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.

LARRY	You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
WALT	Larry, you just take it easy

TAMMY	What?
LISA	I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?

TAMMY	Where 're you going?
LISA	I'm not like you.
TAMMY	What...?
LISA	I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.

LISA	Are you crazy?
TAMMY	What?
LISA	People can see this.
TAMMY	So?
LISA	These are private -- these are for us.
TAMMY	I know.
LISA	But other people can see them too.
TAMMY	I don't care.
LISA	Well, I do.

PAUL	Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
LISA	Sorry.

PAUL	We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
LISA	It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.

LISA	She's doing this to get back at me
PAUL	For what?
LISA	I mean at you.
PAUL	For what?
LISA	I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.

PAUL	We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
LISA	It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
PAUL	Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...

TRACY	Who put you up to this?
PAUL	Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy

TRACY	Who put you up to this?
PAUL	What do you mean?
TRACY	You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
PAUL	No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
TRACY	Thought what?
PAUL	Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
TRACY	So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
PAUL	Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
TRACY	Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.

PAUL	Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
TRACY	Yeah.
PAUL	Hell, good luck!
TRACY	Good luck to you too, Paul.
PAUL	Thanks!

TRACY	Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
PAUL	Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
TRACY	Yeah.
PAUL	You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.

TRACY	Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
PAUL	Sure, Tracy.

TRACY	Can I sign yours too?
PAUL	Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*

TRACY	Yes, Paul?
PAUL	Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
TRACY	Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.

PAUL	Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
TAMMY	Don't you fucking knock?
PAUL	Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
TAMMY	Paul, get out!
PAUL	So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --

TAMMY	You dumbshit!
PAUL	What'd I do?
TAMMY	You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.

TAMMY	What do you want?
PAUL	Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.

PAUL	I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
TAMMY	Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.

TAMMY	Now could you leave me alone?
PAUL	Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
TAMMY	Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
PAUL	Okay.  Great.  I feel good.

JACK	You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
ADELLE	You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.

ADELLE	Oh, and Oxxford called...
JACK	Ooh, my suits are ready...

JACK	Kate Reynolds...
ADELLE	Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.

JACK	Her assistant?
ADELLE	Yeah Jack, her assistant...
JACK	Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
ADELLE	You?  Married?
JACK	Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
ADELLE	Excuse me?
JACK	She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
ADELLE	So you left her?  Just like that?
JACK	God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
ADELLE	Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
JACK	I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
ADELLE	And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...

JACK	No...
ADELLE	No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
JACK	She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.

JACK	I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
ADELLE	That'll be a nice little holiday treat.

JACK	Hello?
ADELLE	Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
JACK	Adelle?
ADELLE	You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...

ALAN	Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
JACK	Is that tonight?

JACK	You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
ALAN	I don't know.  Maybe...

ALAN	You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
JACK	I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
ALAN	Why Jack?
JACK	Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...

JACK	Mr. Mintz.
ALAN	Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
JACK	I can see that, Alan.

ALAN	You have kids, Jack?
JACK	Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.

JACK	I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
ALAN	A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
JACK	Thats right. And auto supply...
ALAN	Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.

JACK	Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
ALAN	Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
JACK	We did one point seven million in total revenue...
ALAN	Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?

JACK	Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
ALAN	Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?

JACK	Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
ALAN	Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
JACK	Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  Its just people...

JACK	And I know people.
ALAN	Im sure you do...

JACK	Take you, for instance...
ALAN	What about me?
JACK	You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...

ALAN	...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
JACK	Seven.  Really.

JACK	Good for you. Why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
ALAN	I dont think youre hearing me.
JACK	Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.

ALAN	Jack, are you okay?
JACK	Whats going on here?
ALAN	Its not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. Were not sure which one, Julias on it right now. Word is theyre willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we shouldve been prepared for this.  Were in trouble here, Jack...

ALAN	Excuse me?
JACK	But I think I like you better this way...
ALAN	Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?

JACK	No.
ALAN	So what are we gonna do, Jack?

ANNIE	Rise...and...shine...!
KATE	Youre jumping, sweetheart...

ANNIE	Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
KATE	Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...

KATE	Were almost done here...
ANNIE	Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
KATE	Thats right.  Okay, lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Ill run into the linen store...

KATE	Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
ANNIE	Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...

JACK	This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
ANNIE	Wheres my real dad?
JACK	I dont know...

ANNIE	They did a pretty good job.
JACK	Who did?
ANNIE	The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
JACK	Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?

ANNIE	Do you like kids?
JACK	On a case by case basis...
ANNIE	You know how to make chocolate milk?
JACK	I think I could figure it out.
ANNIE	You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
JACK	Sure.

ANNIE	This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
JACK	Check...

ANNIE	I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
JACK	Five thirty.  Okay.
ANNIE	Try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
JACK	Got it.  Good tip.
ANNIE	Bye...

JACK	Where do I go now?
ANNIE	Big Eds.
JACK	Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
ANNIE	Thats where you work.

ANNIE	Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
JACK	Like what?
ANNIE	One year he had a solar system named after her...
JACK	Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
ANNIE	Mom liked it.

JACK	Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
ANNIE	Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
JACK	Right.  Thats a major oversight...  So if Im Kate...I cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, Im trapped in suburbia...

JACK	Very nice. What is it?
ANNIE	Mary Had A Little Lamb.
JACK	Ah. A classic...

JACK	What are you doing?
ANNIE	Ringing my bell...

ANNIE	Is it morning yet?
JACK	No, honey. Go back to sleep.

ARNIE	I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  Its throwin everybody off.  What do you think?
JACK	Great room...

JACK	Were friends, arent we?
ARNIE	Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...

JACK	Im having kind of a bad day.
ARNIE	I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...

ARNIE	What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?
JACK	Is it...?
ARNIE	Trouble at work?
JACK	I dont think so.
ARNIE	Its not Kate, is it?

ARNIE	You see, its like were in each others heads...
JACK	Kates my wife...

ARNIE	Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have...
JACK	Its just two kids, right?

JACK	Damn...
ARNIE	Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!

ARNIE	Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
JACK	Hey, Im doing the best I can...  Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
ARNIE	Youre right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...

ARNIE	Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
JACK	I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
ARNIE	She is relentless.
JACK	She wants to have an affair with me.
ARNIE	She said that?
JACK	Pretty much.
ARNIE	Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
JACK	So could you write down her exact address?
ARNIE	Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
JACK	It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
ARNIE	Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
JACK	Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn.
ARNIE	Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.

ARNIE	Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
JACK	Hey, is that really necessary?
ARNIE	All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...

ARNIE	So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
JACK	Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?

ARNIE	Hey, you cant park that thing here.
JACK	Its me, Jack...
ARNIE	I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
JACK	Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
ARNIE	Howd you know my name?
JACK	We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
ARNIE	I never won anything in bowling.

ARNIE	Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
JACK	Yes...Jack Campbell...
ARNIE	Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
JACK	Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together.
ARNIE	You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
JACK	Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...

JACK	Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
BIG ED	What the hell are you talking about?  Whats he talking about?
JACK	Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise itll be returned!
BIG ED	The Caddy?  Why dont you take your own damn car!

BIG ED	Got a minute, Jack?
JACK	Ive got all the time in the world...

BIG ED	Cmon Jack...
JACK	I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...

CASH	DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
JACK	No.
CASH	Yes you do...
JACK	Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.

JACK	Like I said, it's a business deal...
CASH	Damn, you are the real thing...

JACK	How'd you know my name was Jack?
CASH	I call all you white guys "Jack."

CASH	You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
JACK	There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
CASH	A lucky streak, huh?

CASH	So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
JACK	I don't do that.  That's just not for me...

CASH	Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
JACK	Hey...

JACK	What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
CASH	You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.

JACK	I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
CASH	Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.

JACK	I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
CASH	Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?

CASH	Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
JACK	Everyone needs something.

CASH	Yeah?  What do you need?
JACK	Me?
CASH	You just said everyone needs something.
JACK	I've got everything I need.
CASH	Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.

JACK	Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
CASH	You still think this is about me, don't you?
JACK	Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
CASH	Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...

CASH	Miss me, Jack?
JACK	Thats my car!  You stole my car!
CASH	Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
JACK	What?!
CASH	Basically, its my car now.  Get in.

CASH	Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
JACK	What the hell is happening to me?!

CASH	Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
JACK	Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
CASH	No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
JACK	You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!

CASH	Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...
JACK	Give me my goddamn life back!
CASH	You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
JACK	Please.  Just tell me whats happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...

CASH	Its a glimpse, Jacko.
JACK	I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
CASH	Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
JACK	I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!

CASH	Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
JACK	How much time?!
CASH	As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
JACK	Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?

CASH	Do I look like I need your money.  It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.
JACK	Why not?
CASH	Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
JACK	Figure it out?  Figure what out?!

JACK	Thats it?  Thats all I get?!  A glare?!
CASH	Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.

JACK	Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
CASH	Do I look like I live in a bottle?

JACK	But what do I do?
CASH	Look Jack Im late.  Id love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.

JACK	You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
CASH	Cmon, Jack...

JACK	Ive got kids, Im going home...
CASH	You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing.

CASH	...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
SAM WONG	Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
CASH	What're you talkin' about?
SAM WONG	You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!

CASH	What!?  Look at the ticket...!
SAM WONG	Get out, I call 911.

SAM WONG	You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
CASH	You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
SAM WONG	Get out!

EVELYN	Like the dress...?
JACK	Its lovely...
EVELYN	I thought I saw you notice it at the kids recital.

EVELYN	Finger food...?
JACK	I dont think so, thank you...
EVELYN	Cmon, as soon as I put them down, youre gonna grab a couple...you always do...

EVELYN	Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
JACK	Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...

JACK	Evelyn, right?
EVELYN	Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
JACK	Something like that.
EVELYN	Need a nurse?
JACK	Youre a nurse?

JACK	Are we...?
EVELYN	Are we what, Jack?
JACK	Is there something going on between us?

EVELYN	Are we finally being honest?
JACK	It would help me if we were.
EVELYN	Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...

JACK	I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
FRANK	Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.

FRANK	Merry Christmas to you, sir...
JACK	Thanks.  To you too...

FRANK	Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
JACK	Frank.  Wheres Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
FRANK	Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
JACK	Look, I dont know whats going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
FRANK	I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
JACK	Maybe youre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...

JACK	Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
KENNY	Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
JACK	Thank you.

JACK	...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
KENNY	No, I didnt...thats great.
JACK	Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
KENNY	Uh huh...
JACK	I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...

KENNY	Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
JACK	Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...

KENNY	Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
JACK	If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
KENNY	You want me to handle him?  I think Im ready...

JACK	Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
KENNY	Okay, chief.

TONY THE DOORMAN	Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
JACK	Howd you do this year, Tony?
TONY THE DOORMAN	About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
JACK	Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...

TONY THE DOORMAN	Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
JACK	What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
TONY THE DOORMAN	Uh-huh...

KATE	Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
JACK	All in one tape?
KATE	I also put side two of London Calling on there...

KATE	I have a bad feeling about this.
JACK	About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
KATE	I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.

KATE	Dont  go, Jack...
JACK	You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
KATE	Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
JACK	For us, Kate.
KATE	Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane...
JACK	What?

KATE	Go. Im sorry, you should just go...
JACK	No, youre right.  What are we doing?
KATE	We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.

KATE	I can't seem to let go of you...
JACK	You hear me complaining about that?

KATE	Are you okay?
JACK	Yeah...fine.

KATE	What kind of man does that!?
JACK	I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!

KATE	Where were you?
JACK	I was in the city.
KATE	The city?  New York City?  Why?
JACK	Because thats where I live.
KATE	Jack...dont even start...
JACK	Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...

KATE	Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is...
JACK	Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
KATE	You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
JACK	Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.

JACK	What are you doing?
KATE	Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
JACK	Why not?
KATE	Because youll be here.

JACK	Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
KATE	Funny, Jack.  Im laughing on the inside.

JACK	Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
KATE	Uh huh...

KATE	Jack...
JACK	Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...

KATE	Here you go...
JACK	Youre kidding me...
KATE	Shes your dog, Jack.
JACK	No, shes not.
KATE	Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
JACK	But its twenty degrees outside...
KATE	Youre having a bad day, Ill go with you...actually, theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there...

JACK	Hello!
KATE	...my feet are hurtin...
JACK	HEY!

JACK	Uh...that babys crying...
KATE	And...?

KATE	Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
JACK	Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...

JACK	Hey!  I was watching that!
KATE	I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
JACK	Im working on a new deal now...

JACK	Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?
KATE	That is the general idea, yes...

JACK	Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
KATE	Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
JACK	Whatever you say...honey.

KATE	Thanks, Jack...
JACK	No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
KATE	This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
JACK	I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...

KATE	How can you do that?
JACK	Do what?
KATE	Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...

KATE	I mean...wow...off the charts great.
JACK	Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...

KATE	$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
JACK	She got those shoes...
KATE	Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  Cmon, take it off.  Well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.

KATE	No?
JACK	Do you have any idea what my life is like?
KATE	Excuse me?
JACK	I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.

JACK	I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
KATE	Really.
JACK	Whats in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?

KATE	Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
JACK	I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!

JACK	Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
KATE	Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.

KATE	Well...Annie for one.
JACK	Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
KATE	I think it worked out okay, dont you?
JACK	Sure.  I really like Annie.
KATE	Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
JACK	No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
KATE	We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
JACK	Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
KATE	You cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...

KATE	The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
JACK	You had a heart attack?
KATE	Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
JACK	Thats why I work for Big Ed?

JACK	Our life in a nutshell...
KATE	If you want to look at it that way...
JACK	How would you look at it?

KATE	How was the game, honey?
JACK	Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?

KATE	You mean this chocolate cake?
JACK	Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.

JACK	Cmon.
KATE	Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me.

KATE	You want the cake!?
JACK	I want it...

JACK	Thank you...
KATE	Its good, right?

KATE	Say it, Jack...
JACK	What...?
KATE	Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
JACK	Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
KATE	Then say it...just say it to me...!
JACK	Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...

JACK	Not it...?
KATE	Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet.
JACK	What? You make me hot...

KATE	Jack.
JACK	Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?

JACK	Maybe I should wait...
KATE	No, open it...

KATE	I found it at an outlet store.  I know its a knock-off, but I think itll look great on you...
JACK	Zeena...

JACK	You really are incredible...
KATE	Enjoy it, sweetheart...

JACK	Heres the thing.  I really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversarys good all day...
KATE	What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
JACK	I know that, but...

KATE	You actually forgot our anniversary.
JACK	Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.

KATE	Jack...can we afford all this?
JACK	Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
KATE	How do you even know about this place?

KATE	You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
JACK	But Im gettin close, right?

JACK	I need to tell you something.
KATE	Okay...
JACK	I think it may help us but theres a slight chance it could make things worse.

KATE	Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
JACK	Are you sure?

JACK	I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
KATE	Worse, you mean...
JACK	No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...

JACK	I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
KATE	And now...?
JACK	Now...I dont...

KATE	I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
JACK	But you always seem so certain.
KATE	Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
JACK	Thats a big one for me, too.
KATE	My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
JACK	Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
KATE	I mean yes, I help people that need it...
JACK	I guess...some of them are probably faking.
KATE	God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...

KATE	Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
JACK	Its wonderful...

JACK	Good things...
KATE	What are you sure about?

KATE	You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
JACK	Ill just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.

KATE	I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
JACK	Im out of the doghouse?
KATE	Way out...

JACK	Youre so...beautiful...
KATE	I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...

JACK	My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
KATE	Thats all I wanted to hear...

KATE	I could stay here forever...
JACK	I dont think Id fight you on that one...

JACK	Pretty incredible, isnt it?
KATE	Its like a museum.

KATE	So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
JACK	Think bigger.
KATE	For the week?

JACK	This place is a perk, Kate.
KATE	A perk for what?
JACK	A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...

JACK	Youre talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
KATE	What are you talking about, Jack?

KATE	Are you out of your mind?
JACK	I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
KATE	Annie goes to a great school.
JACK	Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
KATE	Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
JACK	This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
KATE	I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
JACK	No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
KATE	Jack.

JACK	I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
KATE	Then get a goddamn snow blower!

KATE	Dont do that...
JACK	Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.

KATE	Its been interesting, thats for sure.
JACK	But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
KATE	Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...

JACK	I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
KATE	Are you okay, Jack?
JACK	Please, just promise me youll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you dont, then its like it never happened and I dont think I could live with that.

KATE	I promise, Jack...
JACK	Promise me again...
KATE	I promise. Come to bed, honey.

JACK	Kate...
KATE	Jack...God, its been so long...You look...

JACK	You look great.
KATE	Its good to see you...

JACK	I'm sorry...
KATE	Dont worry about it, Jack...

JACK	Whats going on?
KATE	Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
JACK	Paris?

JACK	Youre moving...
KATE	Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
JACK	To Paris. Paris, France.
KATE	Thats the one...
JACK	So youre not at a non- profit firm?
KATE	Not with what they pay me...
JACK	Youre not married, are you?
KATE	No, Jack, I never got married. You?
JACK	Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?

JACK	You cant go!
KATE	Jesus, Jack...
JACK	Dont get on that plane!
KATE	Jack.
JACK	Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
KATE	What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?

KATE	Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
JACK	We have two kids, Annie and Josh...

JACK	Mrs. Peterson.
MRS. PETERSON	Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
JACK	Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
MRS. PETERSON	You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...

MRS. PETERSON	No...
JACK	Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, Ill be fine...
MRS. PETERSON	And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
JACK	A shelter?!  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!

JACK	Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
LASSITER	That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
JACK	And God love you for it.

LASSITER	I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
JACK	That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
LASSITER	Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
JACK	Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
LASSITER	I need you, tiger..
JACK	Where is he?
LASSITER	Aspen.

JACK	Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
LASSITER	You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
JACK	Not by a long shot.
LASSITER	Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.

JACK	Peter Lassiter...
LASSITER	Do I know you?
JACK	Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...

LASSITER	...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
JACK	But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...

LASSITER	He certainly has your number, Alan.
JACK	Youre a little tougher, Peter.

JACK	For one thing, you like expensive things.
LASSITER	Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
JACK	Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...

JACK	For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
MAN	Okay, Ill take them...
JACK	You wont regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/As...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...

MAN	Can I help you?
JACK	Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
MAN	Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?

JACK	Damn...damn...damn...
MAN	Hey, are you okay?
JACK	No...Im not...
MAN	Is there anything I can do for you?

MAN	Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
JACK	Im sorry, no...

PAULA	Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
JACK	Of course I did.
PAULA	Last night was great...
JACK	You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
PAULA	Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...

JACK	I want to see you again.
PAULA	I'd like that, too.
JACK	Tonight.

PAULA	It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
JACK	So we'll get egg nog.

PAULA	I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
JACK	Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
PAULA	I'm taking the train...

PAULA	Don't you have anywhere to go?
JACK	I've got plenty of places to go.

PAULA	Maybe I can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  Okay?
JACK	If it's something you feel strongly about.

JACK	Thats totally see through...
PAULA	Merry Christmas...
JACK	Christmas?  It cant be Christmas...

LORI	Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
KATE	Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
LORI	Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.

KATE	You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
LORI	Maybe its by the wardrobe boxes...

LORI	Ill go for a cup of coffee!
KATE	Yes!

KATE	I found it!
LORI	Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?

FLETCH	First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
BOYD	Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --

FLETCH	Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
BOYD	Unbelievable.
FLETCH	I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
BOYD	Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
FLETCH	God I admire you.
BOYD	By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
FLETCH	Comanche Indian.

CLERK	Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
FLETCH	You're kidding.
CLERK	Would you like me to change anything?
FLETCH	So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
CLERK	We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
FLETCH	Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?

FLETCH	Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
CLERK	You mean her.
FLETCH	What?
CLERK	Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
FLETCH	Oh, thanks.

FLETCH	Maybe tonight?
CREASY	Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
FLETCH	That's what he said.
CREASY	He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
FLETCH	I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
CREASY	Sonofabitch.
FLETCH	Wonder who his supplier is.
CREASY	I have no idea.
FLETCH	I wasn't asking.
CREASY	He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
FLETCH	I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
CREASY	I ought to get some sleep.
FLETCH	Creasy, how old are you?
CREASY	Nineteen.
FLETCH	You're not taking real good care of yourself.

FLETCH	Hey, what are you doing?
CREASY	Fletch, this is dumb.
FLETCH	You don't have to run with me, Crease.

CREASY	Fletch!
FLETCH	What goddamn right do you have to take him?

CREASY	Hey you're really nuts.
FLETCH	They didn't do anything.
CREASY	What? What are you talking about?
FLETCH	I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
CREASY	You're lucky.
FLETCH	Not luck. They don't want me.

FLETCH	You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
CUMMINGS	You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
FLETCH	Fletch.
CUMMINGS	Full name.
FLETCH	Fletch F. Fletch
CUMMINGS	I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
FLETCH	I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.

CUMMINGS	Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
FLETCH	Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
CUMMINGS	For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
FLETCH	It was planted on me, sir.
CUMMINGS	We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?

CUMMINGS	Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
CUMMINGS	I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
FLETCH	'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
CUMMINGS	You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.

CUMMINGS	You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
FLETCH	Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.

FLETCH	You can't keep me here.
CUMMINGS	Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
FLETCH	I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.

CUMMINGS	After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
FLETCH	My God, you're serious.
CUMMINGS	Ask anybody.
FLETCH	Can I ask anybody now?

FLETCH	Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
CUMMINGS	What'll it be Fletch?

FLETCH	I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
CUMMINGS	Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.

CUMMINGS	Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
FLETCH	Not a prayer.
CUMMINGS	That a boy.

CUMMINGS	Thanks for coming down to see us.
FLETCH	Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?

CUMMINGS	Greetings, everyone.
FLETCH	Thank God, the police.

CUMMINGS	This one's going to be even more fun.
FLETCH	Go ahead. Make my evening.

MR. STANWYK	What the hell are you doing here?
CUMMINGS	Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.

MR. STANWYK	I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
CUMMINGS	Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?

CUMMINGS	Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
MR. STANWYK	I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
CUMMINGS	What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?

MR. STANWYK	Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
CUMMINGS	Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.

DR. DOLEN	So where do you know Alan from?
FLETCH	We play tennis at the club.
DR. DOLEN	Really. The California Racquet Club?
FLETCH	Yes.
DR. DOLEN	That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
FLETCH	Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
DR. DOLEN	Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
FLETCH	That's Babar.
DR. DOLEN	Two bs?
FLETCH	One. B-a-b-a-r.
DR. DOLEN	That's two.
FLETCH	But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
DR. DOLEN	Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
FLETCH	I don't know. I don't have any.
DR. DOLEN	No children?
FLETCH	No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
DR. DOLEN	Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.

FLETCH	Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
DR. DOLEN	Your aunt?
FLETCH	Mrs. Smith.
DR. DOLEN	Joan or Margaret Smith.
FLETCH	Right.
DR. DOLEN	Well, which one?
FLETCH	Margaret.
DR. DOLEN	Funny old bird.
FLETCH	Is she ever. I've got some stories....
DR. DOLEN	I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
FLETCH	It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
DR. DOLEN	Oh, he was dying for years.
FLETCH	Sure, but the end was so sudden.
DR. DOLEN	He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
FLETCH	Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
DR. DOLEN	Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
FLETCH	Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
DR. DOLEN	Just relax....
FLETCH	Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.

FLETCH	Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
DR. DOLEN	Breathe easy...
FLETCH	Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
DR. DOLEN	There is?
FLETCH	Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
DR. DOLEN	Just relax.
FLETCH	Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
DR. DOLEN	I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
FLETCH	I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
DR. DOLEN	Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
FLETCH	I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
DR. DOLEN	Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
FLETCH	Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.

FLETCH	So what do you figure?
FAT SAM	No idea.
FLETCH	No idea at all?
FAT SAM	Okay. Some idea.
FLETCH	Like when?
FAT SAM	Like tonight.
FLETCH	For sure?
FAT SAM	No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
FLETCH	I think Id rather have drugs.
FAT SAM	Fletch...
FLETCH	Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you?

FAT SAM	Jesus.
FLETCH	You don't know me.
FAT SAM	My pleasure.
FLETCH	I'm serious, Sam.
FAT SAM	What, the heat here?
FLETCH	Affirmative.
FAT SAM	The two surfer boys?
FLETCH	Affirmative.
FAT SAM	Thought so. What for?
FLETCH	For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
FAT SAM	You gonna nail the chief?
FLETCH	I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
FAT SAM	Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
FLETCH	You don't have a piece of the action?
FAT SAM	Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
FLETCH	Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
FAT SAM	Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
FLETCH	What?
FAT SAM	You find the source?
FLETCH	Gum thought Brazil.
FAT SAM	Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.

FLETCH	It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
RECORDS NURSE	Nothing. They're still there.
FLETCH	Right. Fine.

RECORDS NURSE	Are you all right, Doctor?
FLETCH	Where am I?
RECORDS NURSE	You're in the Records Room.
FLETCH	I'm fine.
RECORDS NURSE	Can I get you something?
FLETCH	Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
RECORDS NURSE	Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
FLETCH	Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
RECORDS NURSE	Oh my God!
FLETCH	It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.

FLETCH	Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
RECORDS NURSE	Yes, right away.

RECORDS NURSE	Here you are, Doctor.
FLETCH	Thank you.

RECORDS NURSE	Is there anything particular you're looking for?
FLETCH	My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
RECORDS NURSE	Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
FLETCH	That's it?
RECORDS NURSE	That's it.
FLETCH	This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
RECORDS NURSE	I guess not.
FLETCH	He'll be so relieved.

GILLETT	Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
FLETCH	What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
GILLETT	I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
FLETCH	I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.

GILLETT	You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
FLETCH	She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
GILLETT	I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
FLETCH	It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
GILLETT	Until she remarries, Fletch.
FLETCH	Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
GILLETT	I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
FLETCH	She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
GILLETT	You should have proved that in a court of law.
FLETCH	My lawyer was a bum.
GILLETT	I agree.

FLETCH	I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
GILLETT	You may be right.
FLETCH	Are you serious?
GILLETT	That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
FLETCH	Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.

FLETCH	Damn... lost again. Sorry.
GILLETT	This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.

GILLETT	Cash. I'm impressed.
FLETCH	Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
GILLETT	Till then.

MR. STANWYK	Good evening.
FLETCH	I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
MR. STANWYK	Of course.

MR. STANWYK	Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
FLETCH	Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
MR. STANWYK	What?

FLETCH	Read this, please.
MR. STANWYK	Wait a second --
FLETCH	Cut the crap and read it.

FLETCH	He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
FLETCH	Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
MR. STANWYK	'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'

FLETCH	He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
MR. STANWYK	I'd have been long gone.
FLETCH	Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'

MR. STANWYK	Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
FLETCH	The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.

MR. STANWYK	And what was that?
FLETCH	How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.

MR. STANWYK	I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
FLETCH	Whoops.

FLETCH	I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
MARVIN	Harry S. Truman?
FLETCH	My parents were great fans of the former President.
MARVIN	Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
FLETCH	Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
MARVIN	Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
FLETCH	Right.
MARVIN	Well, I'm fully covered.
FLETCH	I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
MARVIN	Yes. Where you from, Harry?
FLETCH	California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
MARVIN	Come on in.

FLETCH	Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
MARVIN	Velma.

FLETCH	Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
MARVIN	Check.
FLETCH	Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
MARVIN	Oh, about ten days ago.

FLETCH	Ten days ago?
MARVIN	That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.

FLETCH	Isn't that nice. Since when?
MARVIN	Since he moved to L.A.

FLETCH	Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
MARVIN	What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
FLETCH	Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
MARVIN	Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.

FLETCH	Has he?
MARVIN	Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
FLETCH	Then he has.
MARVIN	Course he has. That's his wife.

FLETCH	He sighs.
FLETCH	And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
MARVIN	Of course they are.

MARVIN	Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
FLETCH	Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --

FLETCH	I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
GAIL	Where are you going?
FLETCH	Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.

GAIL	I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
FLETCH	You sure did.

GAIL	John Ultramalensky, right?
FLETCH	Right.
GAIL	God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
FLETCH	Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
GAIL	Not mine, stupid. Yours.
FLETCH	What are you doing here?

GAIL	I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
FLETCH	No problem.

GUMMY	Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
FLETCH	Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
GUMMY	Its okay. The cops did it.
FLETCH	I know.
GUMMY	They busted me last week.
FLETCH	They bust you every week.
GUMMY	I know. I got bad luck or something.

FLETCH	I'm the Sufi.
GUMMY	Fletch?
FLETCH	Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
GUMMY	What?
FLETCH	Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.

GUMMY	Why are they after you?
FLETCH	Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.

FLETCH	Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
GUMMY	What's that?
FLETCH	He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
GUMMY	I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
FLETCH	Sure you did.
GUMMY	Fletch, I never sold nothing.
FLETCH	Twenty years.

FLETCH	Where does the Chief get the drugs?
GUMMY	I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
FLETCH	Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
GUMMY	Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
FLETCH	That's Brazil.
GUMMY	Yeah. Maybe.
FLETCH	Wait here for me, Gummy.

STANWYK	We can't talk about it here.
FLETCH	Why not?
STANWYK	Because we can't.
FLETCH	Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
STANWYK	I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
FLETCH	I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
STANWYK	I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
FLETCH	Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
STANWYK	It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
FLETCH	Nugent. Ted Nugent.
STANWYK	Alan Stanwyk.
FLETCH	Charmed.

FLETCH	Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
STANWYK	Who?
FLETCH	Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.

FLETCH	I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
STANWYK	Come inside.

STANWYK	Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.
FLETCH	I'm all ears.
STANWYK	I want you to murder me.

FLETCH	You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
STANWYK	I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
FLETCH	Why don't you try suicide?
STANWYK	My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
FLETCH	So why pick me?
STANWYK	You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
FLETCH	Maybe I'm just on vacation.
STANWYK	Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
FLETCH	Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
STANWYK	I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.

FLETCH	I'm still here.
STANWYK	I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
FLETCH	Wouldn't they normally be locked?
STANWYK	Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
FLETCH	I have the same problem with my help.
STANWYK	I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
FLETCH	I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
STANWYK	In this drawer....

FLETCH	A .357.
STANWYK	Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
FLETCH	So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
STANWYK	Precisely. Are you a good shot?
FLETCH	What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
STANWYK	Get me on the first shot, if you can.
FLETCH	I don't think you'll have to worry about that.

STANWYK	Do you have a passport?
FLETCH	Sure, all drifters do.
STANWYK	Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
FLETCH	Take it where?

STANWYK	LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
FLETCH	Where am I going?
STANWYK	Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
FLETCH	They serve dinner on the flight?
STANWYK	It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
FLETCH	You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
STANWYK	I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
FLETCH	You sure those doors will be open?
STANWYK	Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
FLETCH	The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
STANWYK	That's right.
FLETCH	You sure got the hard part.
STANWYK	What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.

STANWYK	Will you kill me?
FLETCH	Sure.

LARRY	Yo!
FLETCH	Can I steal you for a minute?
LARRY	Only if you promise not to return me.
FLETCH	Deal.
LARRY	'Magic' today, huh?
FLETCH	Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
LARRY	Shoot.
FLETCH	Don't say shoot, okay.

FLETCH	Did you hear something?
LARRY	Not me.
FLETCH	Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.

FLETCH	W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
LARRY	No problem, boss.

FLETCH	'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
LARRY	Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
FLETCH	'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
LARRY	Not our kind of people, you understand.
FLETCH	Spot right here.

FLETCH	Thanks.
LARRY	You doing a story on this guy?
FLETCH	Maybe.

FLETCH	'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
FLETCH	I wonder if that's his doctor.
LARRY	Only one way to find out.

LARRY	Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---
FLETCH	That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.

LARRY	Did you say cops?
FLETCH	Yeah.
LARRY	That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.

LARRY	My hero.
FLETCH	Nothing to it.

LARRY	I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
FLETCH	You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
LARRY	I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
FLETCH	Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.

VELMA	Cute young thing, too.
FLETCH	I'm sorry?
VELMA	His bride. Cute as a button.
FLETCH	You've met her?

FLETCH	Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
VELMA	Cute thing.
FLETCH	Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
VELMA	Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.

VELMA	She's cute as a button.
FLETCH	How long have they been married?

VELMA	Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
FLETCH	No, thank you.
VELMA	How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?

FLETCH	I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
MRS. STANWYK	I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
FLETCH	Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
MRS. STANWYK	Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
FLETCH	We used to fly together. I'm... John.
MRS. STANWYK	John! You used to fly together!

MRS. STANWYK	John who?
FLETCH	John Ultrarelamensky.
MRS. STANWYK	Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
FLETCH	It's Scotch-Rumanian.
MRS. STANWYK	That's a strange combination.
FLETCH	So were my parents.
MRS. STANWYK	Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
FLETCH	Please.

MRS. STANWYK	Damn, I thought I had that one.
FLETCH	You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
MRS. STANWYK	What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
FLETCH	Preoccupied with what?
MRS. STANWYK	Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!

FLETCH	Why do you keep doing this?
MRS. STANWYK	I love the outfits.

MRS. STANWYK	Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
FLETCH	I have this effect on lots of women.
MRS. STANWYK	I bet you do.
FLETCH	Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
MRS. STANWYK	Alan's in Utah.
FLETCH	I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
MRS. STANWYK	Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
FLETCH	I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
MRS. STANWYK	If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
FLETCH	You are a rich woman.
MRS. STANWYK	See what I mean?

FLETCH	What's he doing in Utah?
MRS. STANWYK	None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.

MRS. STANWYK	Who is it?
FLETCH	It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
MRS. STANWYK	John Ultramalensky?

FLETCH	Hi.
MRS. STANWYK	Hi.
FLETCH	I was hoping you'd say that.

MRS. STANWYK	Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
FLETCH	Can I borrow your towel for a minute?

MRS. STANWYK	I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
FLETCH	I ordered lunch.
MRS. STANWYK	You ordered it here?
FLETCH	Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
MRS. STANWYK	Down boy.

MRS. STANWYK	I really should change.
FLETCH	No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
MRS. STANWYK	I mean put clothes on.
FLETCH	Here, take mine.

MRS. STANWYK	Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
FLETCH	Yes.

FLETCH	Lunch...
MRS. STANWYK	God...

MRS. STANWYK	All this goes on Underhill's bill?
FLETCH	I saved his life during the war.
MRS. STANWYK	You were in the war?
FLETCH	No. He was. I got him out.

FLETCH	'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
MRS. STANWYK	It's amazing.
FLETCH	'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
MRS. STANWYK	Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
FLETCH	'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
MRS. STANWYK	Just like Alan. It's freaky.
FLETCH	Can I ask you a question?
MRS. STANWYK	Depends on the question.
FLETCH	Are you still in love with Alan?
MRS. STANWYK	No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
FLETCH	Why'd you let me in?
MRS. STANWYK	Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
FLETCH	Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
MRS. STANWYK	Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
FLETCH	Good point.
MRS. STANWYK	Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
FLETCH	What about his parents?
MRS. STANWYK	He never sees them and I never met them.
FLETCH	How come?

FLETCH	Thanks for the great time.
MRS. STANWYK	What is this?
FLETCH	Long story.

FLETCH	I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
MRS. STANWYK	I think you should call me Gail, now.
FLETCH	Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
MRS. STANWYK	Why did you do it?

MRS. STANWYK	A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
FLETCH	Yeah.
MRS. STANWYK	I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
FLETCH	Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.

MRS. STANWYK	Who.
FLETCH	Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.

MRS. STANWYK	So?
FLETCH	So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
MRS. STANWYK	What are you talking about?
FLETCH	That's what I want to know.

FLETCH	He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
MRS. STANWYK	How do you know about that?
FLETCH	He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
MRS. STANWYK	What does all this mean?
FLETCH	Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
MRS. STANWYK	Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
FLETCH	Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
MRS. STANWYK	But I've seen the deed.
FLETCH	You saw a forgery.

FLETCH	Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
MRS. STANWYK	Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
FLETCH	I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.

FLETCH	No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
MRS. STANWYK	Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
FLETCH	Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?

MRS. STANWYK	No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
FLETCH	I'll take you to a game.
MRS. STANWYK	What are you talking about?
FLETCH	I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
MRS. STANWYK	Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
FLETCH	Act natural.
MRS. STANWYK	I was afraid you'd say that.
FLETCH	If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?

FLETCH	What's wrong, Gail?
MRS. STANWYK	I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
FLETCH	No.
MRS. STANWYK	But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.

MRS. STANWYK	I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
FLETCH	I think you better sit down.
MRS. STANWYK	Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
FLETCH	Gail, please.

MRS. STANWYK	What is this....
FLETCH	I checked. There was no divorce.
MRS. STANWYK	Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
FLETCH	I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.

FLETCH	And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
MRS. STANWYK	Bastard.
FLETCH	I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
MRS. STANWYK	I'm calling the police. Right now.
FLETCH	You can't do that.
MRS. STANWYK	Don't tell me I can't --
FLETCH	They're trying to kill me!

MRS. STANWYK	I'm terrified.
FLETCH	Come here.

MRS. STANWYK	Don't worry, I can take it.
FLETCH	You shouldn't be here.
MRS. STANWYK	I want to hear this.

MRS. STANWYK	I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
FLETCH	Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?

WAITER	Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
FLETCH	Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
WAITER	They just left, sir.
FLETCH	They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
WAITER	Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
FLETCH	Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
WAITER	Very good sir.

FLETCH	Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
WAITER	In her cabana, sir.
FLETCH	Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
WAITER	Cabana one.
FLETCH	One.
WAITER	Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
FLETCH	I would, actually.
WAITER	Charged to the Underhills, sir?
FLETCH	Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
WAITER	Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
FLETCH	I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
WAITER	I recommend it.
FLETCH	Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
WAITER	Very good, sir.

WAITER	You want I set up?
FLETCH	No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
WAITER	Muchas gracias.
FLETCH	Sierra del fuego.

WAITER	Your call is come through.
FLETCH	Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.

MAN	Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
FLETCH	What?

FLETCH	The door was unlocked.
MAN	Lock's busted.
FLETCH	No wonder.
MAN	I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
FLETCH	I commend him on his choice.
MAN	What?
FLETCH	I commend him on his choice

FLETCH	I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
MAN	Who are you?
FLETCH	Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.

FLETCH	Where is she?
MAN	Moved out.
FLETCH	She moved out?

FLETCH	I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
MAN	She moved out.
FLETCH	So you're saying she moved out.
MAN	This morning.
FLETCH	This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.

MAN	What did you want under the bed?
FLETCH	Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
MAN	I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
FLETCH	I'm her cousin.
MAN	Tell the cops.
FLETCH	Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.

WALKER	Fletch.
FLETCH	Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
WALKER	No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
FLETCH	Uh, almost.
WALKER	'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
FLETCH	And a damn fine one, I might add.

FLETCH	Two...
WALKER	Irwin...
FLETCH	Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
WALKER	Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
FLETCH	I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
WALKER	No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
FLETCH	I never read the paper.
WALKER	...never reads the paper...

FLETCH	What's the spread on the game tonight?
WALKER	I don't know.  Look!
FLETCH	Looks great.

WALKER	Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
FLETCH	Why not? Oh shit... really?

FLETCH	Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
WALKER	You broke it? You know the source?
FLETCH	Practically.

WALKER	What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
FLETCH	I have pictures of him. Dealing...
WALKER	So let's go! We run the pictures.
FLETCH	He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
WALKER	Who?
FLETCH	Well, there we're in a gray area.
WALKER	How gray?
FLETCH	I'd say charcoal.
WALKER	I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
FLETCH	Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.

FLETCH	Gummy and two cops...
FLETCH	Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
WALKER	You're onto something. That's good. What?
FLETCH	I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?

WALKER	Just give me a hint, all right?
FLETCH	All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.

FLETCH	More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
WALKER	Utah?
FLETCH	Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
WALKER	What about finding the source?
FLETCH	I have some ideas.
WALKER	Who? Donnie and Marie?
FLETCH	Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
WALKER	Go to transportation, get a ticket.

FLETCH	How could you call him?
WALKER	It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
FLETCH	It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
WALKER	Get out of here.
FLETCH	He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
WALKER	You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
FLETCH	You'll have it.
WALKER	But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
FLETCH	Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
WALKER	I want something I can print!
FLETCH	Print this Frank.

FLETCH	I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
WALKER	What?  Who the hell are they?
FLETCH	This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
WALKER	What...
FLETCH	Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.

FLETCH	I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
WALKER	Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
FLETCH	Forget it.

WALKER	Fletch, you want an apology?
FLETCH	You were going to can me, right?
WALKER	Not really.
FLETCH	Not really?
WALKER	I was upset.
FLETCH	I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
WALKER	Fletch.

FLETCH	Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
MARGIE	Jim Swarthout?
FLETCH	Yeah.

MARGIE	And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
FLETCH	Frieda's boss.
MARGIE	Who's Frieda?
FLETCH	My secretary.

MRS. STANWYK	Yes?
MR. UNDERHILL	Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.

MR. UNDERHILL	Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
MRS. STANWYK	John!

MRS. STANWYK	You don't know the Underhills?
MR. UNDERHILL	I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
MRS. STANWYK	I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
MR. UNDERHILL	Of course.

MR. UNDERHILL	Mrs. Stanwyk!
MRS. STANWYK	In a minute!

NICKY	I used to drive a taxi.
DRIVER	Where you're going, mister?

DRIVER	I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
NICKY	Very big.
DRIVER	I opened thousands of brains.
NICKY	What did you find?
DRIVER	Big mess every time.
NICKY	I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.

NICKY	I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
DRIVER	You are going where?
NICKY	Crosstown.
DRIVER	Very bad today.

DRIVER	We must abandon.
NICKY	What do you mean, we must abandon?
DRIVER	Ruptured steam pipe.

NICKY	We must abandon.
DRIVER	Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
NICKY	Do not inhale.

NICKY	I never left the garage without my Windex.
DRIVER	I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
NICKY	I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.

DRIVER	Under the Manhattan Bridge.
NICKY	That's where I peed.

PAISLEY	Guys ready to order?
ELLIOT	Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
PAISLEY	Elliot?
ELLIOT	This is a great young out-of-work actress.
PAISLEY	Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.

ELLIOT	Say it again.
PAISLEY	Alla puttanesca.
ELLIOT	Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.

ELLIOT	Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
NICKY	I don't want to hear about it.

ELLIOT	A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
NICKY	Shut up, Elliot.
ELLIOT	Quietly effective.

NICKY	You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
ELLIOT	Press a button and they give us money.
NICKY	Ride with me. We need a haircut.

ELLIOT	How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
NICKY	She wants a divorce.
ELLIOT	Don't talk like that.
NICKY	It's over, finished and done with.
ELLIOT	That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
NICKY	I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
ELLIOT	But didn't we know it would happen?
NICKY	Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
ELLIOT	Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?

NICKY	Very dangerous.
ELLIOT	Asbestos lining.
NICKY	We must abandon.
ELLIOT	Do not inhale.

NICKY	I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
ELLIOT	I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
NICKY	You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
ELLIOT	What do I exude?
NICKY	Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
ELLIOT	Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
NICKY	Tonight. What's tonight?
ELLIOT	Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
NICKY	You mean because What's-His-Name.
ELLIOT	You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
NICKY	It's just a review.
ELLIOT	It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
NICKY	What's the fuss? I don't get it.
ELLIOT	That's what I said eighteen months ago.
NICKY	What happened eighteen months ago?
ELLIOT	Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
NICKY	And he was there?
ELLIOT	Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
NICKY	That's awful.
ELLIOT	I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
NICKY	A year and a half later? You're still brooding?

ELLIOT	Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
NICKY	What was it like?
ELLIOT	I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.

ELLIOT	Is it safe?
NICKY	Do we care?
ELLIOT	I think we Nought to wait.
NICKY	I say we go.
ELLIOT	You say we go?
NICKY	Do not inhale.
ELLIOT	I'm not ready.
NICKY	Here we go.

ELLIOT	The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
NICKY	I don't have the problems that artists have.

ELLIOT	Where are you going?
NICKY	Don't wait Efor me.
ELLIOT	What about the haircut?

NICKY	He carries a gun.
ELLIOT	Then you should carry a gun.

NICKY	I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
ELLIOT	Where is it?
NICKY	I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
ELLIOT	That was a big mistake.

NICKY	We're making too much of this.
ELLIOT	No, we're not.
NICKY	I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
ELLIOT	We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?

NICKY	In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
ELLIOT	It's your best play, Nicky.
NICKY	He'll hate it.
ELLIOT	He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.

NICKY	We were thinking of putting in a pool.
ELLIOT	`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
NICKY	What?
ELLIOT	There are things that speak to us from the past.

NICKY	Shoot him.
ELLIOT	The American theater doesn't need people like that.
NICKY	Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
ELLIOT	Keep going west. Last building before the river.
NICKY	How do you Eknow.
ELLIOT	Paisley Porter.
NICKY	What do you mean?
ELLIOT	About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
NICKY	Had to be him.
ELLIOT	She was very evasive.

NICKY	Great game.
FIRST MAN	Unbelievable.
NICKY	Classic.

FIRST MAN	I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
NICKY	What are you talking about?
FIRST MAN	What are we talking about?
NICKY	Yes. What are you implying?

NICKY	Of course I saw it.
FIRST MAN	Did you see the winning run score?
NICKY	You're not making sense. Make sense.

JACK	This could be it.
PETER	This could be it.
JACK	Let's work on it.
PETER	Let's work on it.

JACK	This could Pbe it.
PETER	This could be it.

JACK	This could be it.
PETER	This could be it.
JACK	This could be it.
PETER	This could be it.
JACK	Does it feel comfortable?
PETER	Does what feel comfortable?
JACK	This could be it.
PETER	This could be it.

JOANNA	Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
NICKY	I hear Alan's sick.
JOANNA	Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
NICKY	You know about Adele.
JOANNA	What about her?
NICKY	She's dying.
JOANNA	She died.
NICKY	I talked to her two days ago.
JOANNA	Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
NICKY	Our Peter?
JOANNA	Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
NICKY	Can he get through it?
JOANNA	They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
NICKY	I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
JOANNA	That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
NICKY	About what?
JOANNA	Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
NICKY	Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
JOANNA	Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
NICKY	They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
JOANNA	What?
NICKY	The Red Sox
JOANNA	You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
NICKY	Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
JOANNA	It can't be all that personal.

JOANNA	I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
NICKY	This is how we've managed to last.
JOANNA	We're able to surprise each other.
NICKY	In and out of bed.
JOANNA	Because we're completely mismatched.
NICKY	We don't even like each other, do we?

JOANNA	I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
NICKY	The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?

JOANNA	It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
NICKY	It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
JOANNA	It's your best play, Nicky.
NICKY	They'll lose because they're my team.
JOANNA	He will absolutely hate it.

NICKY	I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
LAUREL	I go to college. I thought you knew.
NICKY	Do you want to get some coffee?
LAUREL	I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
NICKY	What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?

LAUREL	I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
NICKY	Why do you need a radio?
LAUREL	So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
NICKY	That's completely crazy.
LAUREL	Is it?
NICKY	Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
LAUREL	She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
NICKY	And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?

NICKY	If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
LAUREL	Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
NICKY	I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.

LAUREL	Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
NICKY	Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
LAUREL	Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
NICKY	You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
LAUREL	She is kicking you out.
NICKY	Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.

LAUREL	Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
NICKY	Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
LAUREL	I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
NICKY	This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.

NICKY	Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
LAUREL	Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
NICKY	Opening night?
LAUREL	I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?

LAUREL	Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
NICKY	Take it yourself. Take a date.
LAUREL	I don't have a date. I don't want a date.

NICKY	And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
LAUREL	I have a class. I'm late.
NICKY	Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
LAUREL	I'm not sure.

NICKY	Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
LAUREL	Except I won't have a father anymore.
NICKY	I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.

LAUREL	What will we talk about?
NICKY	Everything.

LAUREL	Will I believe you when you tell me something?
NICKY	There's nothing left for me to lie about.

NICKY	I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
LAUREL	Daddy, wait.

LAUREL	Why won't you tell me your name?
STEVEN	It's only our first date.

LAUREL	I'm willing to tell you my name.
STEVEN	Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.

LAUREL	You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
STEVEN	First you tell me.
LAUREL	Brilliantly moving.

STEVEN	What else?
LAUREL	Packs an emotional wallop.
STEVEN	What else?
LAUREL	A flat-out hit.

STEVEN	If you're wondering about the firearm.
LAUREL	Yes.
STEVEN	This building is not secure.

LAUREL	I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
STEVEN	We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
LAUREL	What do we want?
STEVEN	Mystery. Deception.
LAUREL	Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
STEVEN	What's sexy?
LAUREL	Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
STEVEN	Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
LAUREL	You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?

STEVEN	Am I really so deeply repugnant?
LAUREL	Yes.

LAUREL	Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
STEVEN	It's your best play, Nicky.
LAUREL	See, Daddy.
STEVEN	I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
LAUREL	What else?
STEVEN	An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.

LAUREL	See, Daddy.
STEVEN	And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.

LILLIAN	Your father said you might be here.
NICKY	Two-all after six.
LILLIAN	I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
NICKY	We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
LILLIAN	I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
NICKY	All right. What's been going on?
LILLIAN	I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
NICKY	How prominent?
LILLIAN	He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.

NICKY	I'll have whatever she's having.
LILLIAN	I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
NICKY	Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.

NICKY	Opening night, Lillian.
LILLIAN	Who the hell cares?
NICKY	The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
LILLIAN	That's always been my problem.
NICKY	And you've been extremely patient.
LILLIAN	You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
NICKY	You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
LILLIAN	I'd forgotten that.
NICKY	I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
LILLIAN	That's very lovely actually.
NICKY	Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
LILLIAN	Be open with me. I'd like that.
NICKY	There may be things you'd rather not know about.
LILLIAN	I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
NICKY	I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
LILLIAN	Joanne Bourne.
NICKY	Alma Wetzel.
LILLIAN	Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
NICKY	I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
LILLIAN	She's my gynecologist.

NICKY	I am really, deeply sorry.
LILLIAN	It violates so many trusts.
NICKY	It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
LILLIAN	I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
NICKY	We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
LILLIAN	I'm glad we're having this talk.
NICKY	I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.

MATTHEW	What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
NICKY	This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.

MATTHEW	What's it like to shoot somebody?
NICKY	I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.

MATTHEW	Great game. Red Sox are winning.
NICKY	They're always winning. Until they lose.

MATTHEW	Life is good.
NICKY	Life is good.

MATTHEW	People are dependable.
NICKY	I don't know if I can say that.

NICKY	All the failures, all the fatalism.
MATTHEW	Washed away.
NICKY	One more out.

NICKY	It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
MATTHEW	What did it say?
NICKY	A thousand things.
MATTHEW	You're hurting my head.

NICKY	This could be it!
MATTHEW	This could be it!

MATTHEW	Life is true.
NICKY	Life is real.

MICHAEL	Who is it?
NICKY	I'm at the door.
MICHAEL	Go way. I'll call a cop.
NICKY	Pop, will you let me in?
MICHAEL	Where the hell are you?
NICKY	Right here. At the door.

MICHAEL	What do you want?
NICKY	It's me. Nicky.
MICHAEL	Nicky comes on Sunday's.
NICKY	Where are your glasses? Go get them.
MICHAEL	If it's you, what are you doing here?
NICKY	I'm on my way to get a haircut.
MICHAEL	Where does Nicky get his hair cut?

NICKY	Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
MICHAEL	It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.

NICKY	It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
MICHAEL	Get yourself something to eat.

NICKY	We must have been heroic.
MICHAEL	Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
NICKY	Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
MICHAEL	You know the answer to that.
NICKY	I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
MICHAEL	They're only gonna lose.
NICKY	Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
MICHAEL	The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.

NICKY	Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
MICHAEL	It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
NICKY	It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
MICHAEL	But the son is suppose to stop crying.
NICKY	I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.

NICKY	You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
MICHAEL	Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
NICKY	Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
MICHAEL	Since when did that matter?
NICKY	Let's not start that again.
MICHAEL	My back is killing me.
NICKY	Where's your elastic brace?
MICHAEL	I can't find it.
NICKY	You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
MICHAEL	I lost it. I lose everything.
NICKY	I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.

MICHAEL	`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
NICKY	I know, Pop.
MICHAEL	I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
NICKY	I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
MICHAEL	You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
NICKY	Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
MICHAEL	You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.

NICKY	I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
MICHAEL	So what are you going to do about it?
NICKY	What do you want me to do?
MICHAEL	Show him who we are.

TOYOTA	I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
NICKY	Everybody else does. Why not you?
TOYOTA	You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
NICKY	Oh yeah?
TOYOTA	Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?

NICKY	Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
TOYOTA	The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
NICKY	Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
TOYOTA	Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
NICKY	How come you got the kid with you?
TOYOTA	Matthew's my grandson.
NICKY	A grandmother. God bless you.
TOYOTA	He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
NICKY	It's the kid's lucky day.
TOYOTA	This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
NICKY	Now that's a complicated subject.
TOYOTA	That's a simple subject.
NICKY	Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.

TOYOTA	You see what you're doing, don't you?
NICKY	What am I doing?
TOYOTA	You're charming the boy.
NICKY	Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
TOYOTA	Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
NICKY	That's my cousin, Angelo.

TOYOTA	Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
NICKY	It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.

TOYOTA	You're a family man, Frankie?
NICKY	Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
TOYOTA	An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
NICKY	I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
TOYOTA	And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.

NICKY	It's a complicated subject.
TOYOTA	It's a simple subject.

TOYOTA	Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
NICKY	Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
TOYOTA	It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.

TOYOTA	You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
NICKY	It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day.
TOYOTA	You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
NICKY	I want to believe.
TOYOTA	If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.

TOYOTA	Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
NICKY	I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
TOYOTA	Then say it.
NICKY	Life is good.
TOYOTA	Speak it like it's real. Matthew.

NICKY	I don't know.
TOYOTA	Matthew.

NICKY	This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
TOYOTA	Because God loves a winner.
NICKY	He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.

NICKY	All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
TOYOTA	Washed away.
NICKY	Because life is good.
TOYOTA	Because faith is rewarded.

TOYOTA	Don't worry. It's a test.
NICKY	It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.

TOYOTA	This could be it!
NICKY	This could be it!

STEVEN	Then they lost?
NICKY	Why does it matter?
STEVEN	If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
NICKY	Why do you care?
STEVEN	They're my team.
NICKY	No. They're not your team. They're my team.

STEVEN	They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
NICKY	I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
STEVEN	The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
NICKY	If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
STEVEN	Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.

NICKY	I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
STEVEN	When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
NICKY	What about my play?

NICKY	And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
STEVEN	You're out of bullets.

NICKY	aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
SIDNEY	Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
NICKY	appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.

SIDNEY	I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
NICKY	hat was this morning.
SIDNEY	So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?

NICKY	'm not worried about this kid.
SIDNEY	Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
NICKY	Postpone. We have every right.
SIDNEY	Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
NICKY	I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
SIDNEY	You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.

NICKY	I hate the Mets.
SECOND MAN	How come?
NICKY	When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.

NICKY	Have to hurry back.
SECOND MAN	Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
NICKY	Eleventh inning. What else?

SECOND MAN	Game six is history,pal.
NICKY	You're not making sense.

NICKY	What do you mean?
WAITER	To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
NICKY	Why?
WAITER	Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.

WAITER	Yessiree, Bob.
NICKY	Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.

NICKY	Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
WAITER	But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --

NICKY	Sidney remains optimistic.
PETER	Sidney.
NICKY	Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
PETER	I was educated by nuns.
NICKY	Yes.
PETER	I have excellent long-term memory.
NICKY	Yes.
PETER	I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
NICKY	Yes, Peter.
PETER	But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
NICKY	You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
PETER	What color?
NICKY	What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
PETER	Burnt sienna.
NICKY	Mine was cobalt blue.
PETER	This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
NICKY	Yes.
PETER	I kissed her while she was laughing.
NICKY	Yes.
PETER	I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.

NICKY	And the Father replies?
PETER	That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.

NICKY	This could be it.
PETER	I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.

NICKY	What's good?
PAISLEY	We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.

NICKY	You've worked with Elliot?
PAISLEY	I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
NICKY	There was a review.
PAISLEY	I think I remember.
NICKY	So does Elliot.
PAISLEY	Not one of Steven's finer moments.
NICKY	Oh. You know him.
PAISLEY	A little.
NICKY	And he has finer moments now and then.
PAISLEY	He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
NICKY	Endearing.
PAISLEY	Engaging.
NICKY	Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
PAISLEY	A little drastic maybe?
NICKY	Say it again.
PAISLEY	What?
NICKY	You know what.
PAISLEY	Alla puttanesca.
NICKY	One more time.

NICKY	You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
PAISLEY	I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
NICKY	I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
PAISLEY	I hear good things about the new play.
NICKY	So do I. Over and over.
PAISLEY	Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
NICKY	Would you like to meet him?
PAISLEY	He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
NICKY	I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
PAISLEY	The fact is, I have to get going.
NICKY	Is it true?
PAISLEY	Is what true?
NICKY	He wears a disguise.
PAISLEY	Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
NICKY	But you're his friend.
PAISLEY	Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.

PAISLEY	Do you think he can do it?
NICKY	I don't know.
PAISLEY	He's a very sweet man.
NICKY	Where are you going now?
PAISLEY	Home.
NICKY	Someone waiting for you?
PAISLEY	No one's waiting.
NICKY	There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
PAISLEY	If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
NICKY	So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
PAISLEY	But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
NICKY	I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
PAISLEY	Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
NICKY	Yes.
PAISLEY	Never mind.

NICKY	What? Come on, Paisley.
PAISLEY	Our Steven not only disguises himself.
NICKY	Yes.
PAISLEY	He goes to the theater armed.

PAISLEY	He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
NICKY	I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.

STEVEN	You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
PAISLEY	I haven't come to you.
STEVEN	But you're here. So you must have come to me.

PAISLEY	In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
STEVEN	Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
PAISLEY	Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
STEVEN	The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.

PAISLEY	Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
STEVEN	And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
PAISLEY	I don't want you, Steven.

STEVEN	Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
PAISLEY	I'm going home to my machine.

AMY	But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
MARTIN	I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

AMY	You do not.
MARTIN	Yes I do.
AMY	You don't...
MARTIN	In the corporate offices.
AMY	Oh... really?
MARTIN	Yeah...
AMY	What do you do?
MARTIN	I sell biscuits to the Southland.
AMY	You do not.
MARTIN	It's what I do.
AMY	You're so funny...
MARTIN	I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
AMY	--Stop it--
MARTIN	You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
AMY	--No.
MARTIN	Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.

ARLENE	Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
MARTIN	I'm Martin Blank.

ARLENE	Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
MARTIN	Don't say that.

ARLENE	We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
MARTIN	Wonderful.
ARLENE	So, what are you doing now?
MARTIN	Whatever I can get away with.

DAN	Bob. Bob Destephano.
BOB	What?
DAN	I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
BOB	Computer guy.
DAN	Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
BOB	I sell BMW's. What do you do?
DAN	Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.

BOB	Remember high school?
DAN	Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?

MARTIN	Bob...
BOB	What?
MARTIN	It's me. Martin Blank.
BOB	Really...? So what?
MARTIN	Okay. See you later.

BOB	So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
MARTIN	Fine, Bob. How are you?
BOB	Never better.
MARTIN	Really?

BOB	Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
MARTIN	You could've been a contender, huh?

BOB	What am I gonna do?
MARTIN	What do you want to do?
BOB	I want to be an actor.
MARTIN	Then express yourself, Bob.

CLUB MEMBER #1	I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
CLUB MEMBER #2	He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
CLUB MEMBER #1	It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.

CLUB MEMBER #1	That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
CLUB MEMBER #2	A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
CLUB MEMBER #1	Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
CLUB MEMBER #2	Insane.
CLUB MEMBER #1	To make a long story short...

CLUB MEMBER #2	Jesus...
CLUB MEMBER #1	Overflowing with love.

MARTIN	Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
CLUB MEMBER #1	You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
MARTIN	So you eat-- read it everyday?
CLUB MEMBER #1	Yes.
MARTIN	And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
CLUB MEMBER #1	Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.

DEBI	I just play my own collection.
MARTIN	It's nice to see you again.

MARTIN	How long has it been?
DEBI	Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
MARTIN	Ten years, I think. What I miss?

DEBI	Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
MARTIN	Here is now there. There is here.

DEBI	Tell me about yourself.
MARTIN	I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
DEBI	That's it?
MARTIN	Not much else.
DEBI	What's your business?
MARTIN	I'm a professional killer.
DEBI	Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?

MARTIN	Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
DEBI	Okay.

DEBI	All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
MARTIN	Where have I been?
DEBI	More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
MARTIN	I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
DEBI	--Torn down in the name of convenience--
MARTIN	--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
DEBI	Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
MARTIN	You see someone?
DEBI	Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?

MARTIN	Are you going to the reunion?
DEBI	No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
MARTIN	That's part of it.
DEBI	Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
MARTIN	It's always the little things.
DEBI	Yep.

DEBI	Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
MARTIN	Well, there's not much to tell.
DEBI	I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
MARTIN	Bad experiences.
DEBI	You met people.
MARTIN	Bad people.
DEBI	Watched television?
MARTIN	Bad television.
DEBI	Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
MARTIN	What's that?
DEBI	It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
MARTIN	That'd be good.

MARTIN	I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
DEBI	Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
MARTIN	Yes.
DEBI	Unbelievable.
MARTIN	Seven it is.
DEBI	I'll think about it.

DEBI	Are you there?
MARTIN	Yes.
DEBI	Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.

DEBI	Hello...?
MARTIN	This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
DEBI	You're fucking psycho.
MARTIN	Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.

DEBI	Flowers. That's funny.
MARTIN	As long as I get the laugh.
DEBI	Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.

MARTIN	You look beautiful.
DEBI	Okay... Hold on...

DEBI	...Let me get my coat.
MARTIN	I'll just help myself to a cocktail.

MARTIN	Do you want to get a drink first?
DEBI	I think they'll probably have booze there.
MARTIN	Right.

MARTIN	Shoulda brought my gun.
DEBI	What?

MARTIN	--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
DEBI	We haven't seen each other since high school.

DEBI	Which would you rather...?
MARTIN	Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
DEBI	Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
MARTIN	--She's not dead---
DEBI	It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
MARTIN	Wow. I have to give this some thought.
DEBI	No time.
MARTIN	Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.

MARTIN	Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
DEBI	Like heroin?
MARTIN	Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
DEBI	Like love?
MARTIN	Could be. The physical substance of love.

DEBI	He was trying to kill you, right!
MARTIN	Yes.
DEBI	Not the other way around...?
MARTIN	No.
DEBI	Is it something you've done?
MARTIN	It's something I do...

MARTIN	...About five years now.
DEBI	Get the fuck outta here.
MARTIN	Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
DEBI	You're a government spook?

MARTIN	I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
DEBI	Jesus Christ!
MARTIN	Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
DEBI	Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
MARTIN	Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
DEBI	Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
MARTIN	A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
DEBI	You never could have kept this from me.
MARTIN	I was leaving.
DEBI	That's probably a good idea.
MARTIN	Will you come with me?
DEBI	I'm staying here.
MARTIN	What if I come back?
DEBI	I'll hide.

DEBI	You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
MARTIN	You don't understand...
DEBI	That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.

DEBI	You kill people. 
MARTIN	I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
DEBI	Other people can't.

DR. OATMAN	Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
MARTIN	It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?

DR. OATMAN	You went to school with these people.
MARTIN	Come on.
DR. OATMAN	We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
MARTIN	Shouldn't you be taking notes?
DR. OATMAN	Tell me about your vision of the reunion.

DR. OATMAN	How do you know?
MARTIN	I just know.
DR. OATMAN	Say more.
MARTIN	They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."

DR. OATMAN	You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
MARTIN	Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
DR. OATMAN	You know where I live?
MARTIN	We're both professionals, Oatman.
DR. OATMAN	I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
MARTIN	So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
DR. OATMAN	Yes.
MARTIN	Mmm.

DR. OATMAN	And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
MARTIN	Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.

MARTIN	Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
DR. OATMAN	Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
MARTIN	If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
DR. OATMAN	What stuff?
MARTIN	Morality.

DR. OATMAN	Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
MARTIN	If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.

DR. OATMAN	What else? Say more.
MARTIN	Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.

DR. OATMAN	Okay. Repeat this after me.
MARTIN	Out Loud?

MARTIN	...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
DR. OATMAN	Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
MARTIN	This is me breating.

DRIVER	How was your day, today, sir?
MARTIN	Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
DRIVER	Do you like the people you work with?
MARTIN	I work alone.
DRIVER	That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
MARTIN	You understand the psychology of the job.
DRIVER	I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.

DRIVER	You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
MARTIN	No.
DRIVER	Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
MARTIN	Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
DRIVER	It's only natural....

DRIVER	I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
MARTIN	Okay.
DRIVER	Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.

DRIVER	I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
MARTIN	Up on the right.
DRIVER	And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?

MARTIN	What do you want?
GROCER	I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
MARTIN	Like a union?
GROCER	Like a club. Work less, make more.
MARTIN	Thank you, no.
GROCER	We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
MARTIN	And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....

GROCER	It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
MARTIN	Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
GROCER	I'm gonna get you, kid.

GROCER	I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
MARTIN	Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.

GROCER	Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
MARTIN	No harm no foul.
GROCER	A little misunderstanding among my associates.

GROCER	I told them to kill you and they didn't.
MARTIN	Hard to get good help these days.
GROCER	But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
MARTIN	I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!

MARTIN	No deal.
GROCER	Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
MARTIN	Is that right?
GROCER	Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
MARTIN	Nice talk, Sugarmouth.

MARTIN	It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
MARTIN	I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
GROCER	Don't listen to him, he's a professional.

GROCER	...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
MARTIN	Okay.

MARTIN	There you go. I left it blank.
GROCER	Excellent. Here they come.

MARTIN	Hey, Ken. How have you been?
KEN	Hello Martin. How have you been?
MARTIN	Not bad. You?

KEN	Hello, Bob.
MARTIN	Hey, Bob.

KEN	I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
MARTIN	That sounds pretty interesting...

KEN	Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
MARTIN	Those all seem kind of related...

MARTIN	Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
KEN	Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.

MARTIN	Have you seen Debi Newberry?
KEN	Nope.

KEN	The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
MARTIN	I guess.

LARDNER	You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
MCCULLERS	Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
LARDNER	Lisbon?
MCCULLERS	In Portugal, yes.

LARDNER	Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
MCCULLERS	In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.

LARDNER	Well?
MCCULLERS	I don't think so.
LARDNER	Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
MCCULLERS	--Nooo--
LARDNER	--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.

MCCULLERS	That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
LARDNER	It was the PLO.
MCCULLERS	Whatever.

MCCULLERS	I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
LARDNER	We can't do our job unless he does his job.
MCCULLERS	Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
LARDNER	Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
MCCULLERS	Wait a minute--
LARDNER	-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
MCCULLERS	So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
LARDNER	Yup.

LARDNER	He's falling for her. Look at him.
MCCULLERS	He using her.
LARDNER	You're wrong. Look at his face.
MCCULLERS	One cannot love and kill.
LARDNER	I love. I kill.

MCCULLERS	Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
LARDNER	If he does our job, he's our job.
MCCULLERS	I get it.

LARDNER	Did you see Blank in there?
MCCULLERS	No...
LARDNER	Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.

MARTIN	...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
MARCELLA	Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
MARTIN	Patch him through....

MARTIN	Throw that away.
MARCELLA	This?
MARTIN	Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
MARCELLA	It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
MARTIN	Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
MARCELLA	All of it?
MARTIN	And not show it to me. Ever again.
MARCELLA	That's going to cost.
MARTIN	I'll pay.

MARCELLA	They're not happy, sir.
MARTIN	I'm not happy.
MARCELLA	They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
MARTIN	He didn't.
MARCELLA	They blame you for the compromise.
MARTIN	And they want me to make up for it.
MARCELLA	In Detroit. This weekend.
MARTIN	Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
MARCELLA	They were very upset.
MARTIN	Would you describe their position as inflexible?
MARCELLA	Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.

MARCELLA	And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
MARTIN	There's nothing to be done about it.
MARCELLA	I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
MARTIN	Good. What else? Anything interesting?
MARCELLA	Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.

MARCELLA	Enough?
MARTIN	Never enough.
MARCELLA	But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.

MARTIN	I have scruples. Next.
MARCELLA	Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.

MARCELLA	Don't forget your identity.
MARTIN	See you next week.

MARCELLA	This is not good.
MARTIN	I'll do it tomorrow.

MARCELLA	What's it look like?
MARTIN	It's fine.
MARCELLA	You haven't looked at the dossier.
MARTIN	I've looked at it.

MARCELLA	You have.
MARTIN	Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
MARCELLA	I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
MARTIN	Tell them my house exploded.

MARCELLA	I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
MARTIN	Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
MARCELLA	Will do.

MARY	I bought a new rug.
MARTIN	That's wonderful, Mom.
MARY	What's a revival tent?
MARTIN	It's a place where religious people--
MARY	Marlin Perkins and Jim!
MARTIN	Jim?
MARY	His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!

MARTIN	It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
MARY	I spoke to your father the other day.
MARTIN	I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
MARY	Nature made him then broke the mold.

MARTIN	They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
MARY	Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
MARTIN	You have a headache?
MARY	I have a headache. You have a headache?
MARTIN	No, I don't have one.
MARY	You don't have a headache. I have a headache.

MARY	We had a good laugh, didn't we?
MARTIN	Yeah. I guess we did.

MARY	Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
MARTIN	I think I'll go see Debi today.
MARY	Of course you will.
MARTIN	I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
MARY	Take care of her. She's a keeper.
MARTIN	Yeah...
MARY	And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
MARTIN	I have always thought about her and missed her.

PAUL	Marty! It's me. Paul.
MARTIN	Paul?
PAUL	You're leaving me hanging here...

MARTIN	So what happened to you?
PAUL	Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
MARTIN	Fair enough.

PAUL	God it's great to see you.
MARTIN	You too.

MARTIN	Debi's house.
PAUL	Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
MARTIN	No. You drove us here.
PAUL	Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
MARTIN	No.

PAUL	Ten years. What happened!?
MARTIN	I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
PAUL	Thank you.

MARTIN	He sells BMW's?
PAUL	He sold me this bad boy.
MARTIN	How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
PAUL	He gave me a great deal.
MARTIN	Mein Dealer.

PAUL	What the hell happened to you?
MARTIN	I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
PAUL	As long as you had a good time.

MARTIN	It didn't work out.
PAUL	That's too bad.
MARTIN	I have to get my head back into my work.
PAUL	Work's good for the soul.

MARTIN	When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
PAUL	See you in ten years.

MARTIN	So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
SOUTHTEC GUARD	Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.

MARTIN	So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
SOUTHTEC GUARD	To shoot you. Correct.
MARTIN	How did you get this job?
SOUTHTEC GUARD	Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
MARTIN	Wow.

MARTIN	Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
MR. NEWBERRY	Good evening, Mr. Blank.
MARTIN	How are you? How's business?
MR. NEWBERRY	Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
MARTIN	How's that?
MR. NEWBERRY	I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
MARTIN	I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
MR. NEWBERRY	Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?

MARTIN	Why not?
MR. NEWBERRY	So what are you doing with your life now, son?
MARTIN	I'm a professional killer.
MR. NEWBERRY	That's good.

BETTY	Sorry Veronica.
VERONICA	Betty Finn. Gosh.....

VERONICA	I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
BETTY	That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.

VERONICA	Don't say that.
BETTY	Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.

BETTY	I don't believe it. I'm winning.
VERONICA	Don't get cocky, girl.

BETTY	I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
VERONICA	That's bullshit. Just shoot.

BETTY	Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
VERONICA	Shoot.

VERONICA	Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
BETTY	Ronnie!

BETTY	Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
VERONICA	It's not my style, okay?
BETTY	Nice guys finish last. I should know.

BRAD	So, are you a cheerleader?
VERONICA	No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one.
VERONICA	Gee, thanks.
BRAD	It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.

VERONICA	Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
BRAD	Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
VERONICA	Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
BRAD	Hey, don't run away now.

BRAD	How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
VERONICA	Hey really, I don't feel so great.
BRAD	Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.

VERONICA	I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
BRAD	Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
VERONICA	You don't deserve my fucking speech!

COURTNEY	If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent.
VERONICA	You're beautiful.

VERONICA	Oh, I have to hear this.
COURTNEY	In my heart, Heather's still alive.
VERONICA	What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?

VERONICA	I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
COURTNEY	Like last night, Veronica?

VERONICA	I'm sorry? I don't get it.
COURTNEY	You did last night.

DAD	Take a break Veronica, sit down.
VERONICA	All right.

DAD	So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
VERONICA	I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

DAD	Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
VERONICA	Because you're an idiot.
DAD	Oh yeah, that's it.

VERONICA	All right.
DAD	So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
VERONICA	I don't know, it was okay, I guess.

DAD	Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
VERONICA	Because you're an idiot.
DAD	Oh yeah, that's it.

DAD	Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
VERONICA	Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.

EARL	Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
VERONICA	Something like that. Will you do it?
EARL	Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
VERONICA	I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
EARL	I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.

VERONICA	Things are going to change, Earl.
EARL	Uh-huh.

HEATHER CHANDLER	Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
VERONICA	Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
HEATHER CHANDLER	You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
VERONICA	I'll think about it.
HEATHER CHANDLER	Don't think.

HEATHER CHANDLER	Sawyer. Guess what today is?
VERONICA	Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?

VERONICA	Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
HEATHER CHANDLER	Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.

VERONICA	I was talking with someone!
HEATHER CHANDLER	Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.

HEATHER CHANDLER	If you're going to openly be a bitch....
VERONICA	I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
HEATHER CHANDLER	Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.

VERONICA	Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
HEATHER CHANDLER	Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
VERONICA	Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
HEATHER CHANDLER	Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.

HEATHER CHANDLER	Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
VERONICA	Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
HEATHER CHANDLER	Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?

HEATHER CHANDLER	You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
VERONICA	I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
HEATHER CHANDLER	That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
VERONICA	We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
HEATHER CHANDLER	Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.

HEATHER CHANDLER	Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
VERONICA	Geez, don't listen to them.

HEATHER CHANDLER	J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
VERONICA	Never say never.

VERONICA	Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
HEATHER CHANDLER	Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.

HEATHER CHANDLER	What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
VERONICA	Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
HEATHER CHANDLER	No. Hell no.

HEATHER CHANDLER	You stupid cunt!
VERONICA	You goddamn bitch!

HEATHER CHANDLER	You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
VERONICA	Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
HEATHER CHANDLER	Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.

HEATHER CHANDLER	Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
VERONICA	We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
HEATHER CHANDLER	Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?

HEATHER CHANDLER	Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
VERONICA	Heather? Wha...
HEATHER CHANDLER	Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
VERONICA	What are you doing here?!
HEATHER CHANDLER	I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.

HEATHER CHANDLER	Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
HEATHER MCNAMARA	Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.

HEATHER CHANDLER	Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
HEATHER MCNAMARA	Color me nauseous.

HEATHER MCNAMARA	God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
HEATHER CHANDLER	He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.

HEATHER CHANDLER	Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
HEATHER MCNAMARA	King David.
HEATHER CHANDLER	Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.

HEATHER MCNAMARA	So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
HEATHER CHANDLER	I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.

HEATHER DUKE	Where did you get these?
J.D.	Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
HEATHER DUKE	What do you want from me?
J.D.	Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
HEATHER DUKE	But she couldn't handle it.

J.D.	I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
HEATHER DUKE	Very very. The photographs?
J.D.	Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.

HEATHER DUKE	TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
J.D.	Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.

HEATHER DUKE	Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
VERONICA	Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...

VERONICA	Maybe you should see a doctor.
HEATHER DUKE	Yeah, maybe.

HEATHER DUKE	Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
VERONICA	Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.

HEATHER DUKE	Don't worry. We'll work something out.
VERONICA	Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?

HEATHER DUKE	Guess who?
VERONICA	Heather.

HEATHER DUKE	Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
VERONICA	Is she dead?
HEATHER DUKE	That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?

VERONICA	I said I was sorry.
HEATHER DUKE	You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
VERONICA	You're not funny. Ouch!

HEATHER DUKE	What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
VERONICA	Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
HEATHER DUKE	Oh shit, yeah.

HEATHER DUKE	Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
VERONICA	People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
HEATHER DUKE	So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
VERONICA	Don't talk to me like that.
HEATHER DUKE	It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
VERONICA	No.
HEATHER DUKE	Jealous much?

VERONICA	Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
HEATHER DUKE	Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!

HEATHER DUKE	Veronica, you look like hell.
VERONICA	Yeah, I just got back.

HEATHER DUKE	What are you doing?
VERONICA	Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.

VERONICA	What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
HEATHER MCNAMARA	God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.

HEATHER MCNAMARA	God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
VERONICA	Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.

HEATHER MCNAMARA	God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
VERONICA	Give me the clipboard.

HEATHER MCNAMARA	No way, no day!
VERONICA	Give it up girl!

VERONICA	Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
HEATHER MCNAMARA	Yeah, where's your urge to purge?

HEATHER MCNAMARA	That was seriously warped, Veronica.
VERONICA	Uh-huh.

HEATHER MCNAMARA	Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
VERONICA	Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
HEATHER MCNAMARA	Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
VERONICA	Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
HEATHER MCNAMARA	Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.

HEATHER MCNAMARA	Shit.
VERONICA	So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?

VERONICA	What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
HEATHER MCNAMARA	Suicide is a private thing.

VERONICA	You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
HEATHER MCNAMARA	But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
VERONICA	If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?

HEATHER MCNAMARA	Probably....
VERONICA	Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
HEATHER MCNAMARA	Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
VERONICA	Sure.

J.D.	There are no stupid questions.
VERONICA	If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
J.D.	That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.

J.D.	Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
VERONICA	How very.

J.D.	You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
VERONICA	No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
J.D.	I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
VERONICA	Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
J.D.	The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
VERONICA	I didn't. Cherry.

J.D.	Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
VERONICA	I don't know. Should you?
J.D.	My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
VERONICA	Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
J.D.	Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
VERONICA	Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.

VERONICA	It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
J.D.	I don't really like your friends either.
VERONICA	It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
J.D.	Maybe it's time for a vacation.

J.D.	Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
VERONICA	S'okay....
J.D.	I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?

J.D.	That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
VERONICA	You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.

VERONICA	Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
J.D.	Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
VERONICA	Killing her won't solve anything.
J.D.	A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
VERONICA	Well then, I'll pray for rain.
J.D.	See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
VERONICA	Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
J.D.	Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
VERONICA	There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.

J.D.	I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
VERONICA	I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
J.D.	Good plan.
VERONICA	But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.

VERONICA	Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
J.D.	Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.

J.D.	I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
VERONICA	Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.

VERONICA	O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
J.D.	Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.

VERONICA	What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
J.D.	Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.

VERONICA	Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
J.D.	Yeah, great.

VERONICA	No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
J.D.	Chick-en.
VERONICA	You're not funny.

J.D.	Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.
VERONICA	No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
J.D.	And your worst enemy.
VERONICA	Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...

J.D.	What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
VERONICA	Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
J.D.	I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
VERONICA	It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.

J.D.	We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
VERONICA	Like a suicide thing?
J.D.	Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
VERONICA	I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.

VERONICA	You might think what I've done is shocking...
J.D.	To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me.
VERONICA	That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
J.D.	This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
VERONICA	She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
J.D.	That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
VERONICA	You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."

























































J.D.	You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
L271881	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
L271873	u5795	m383	J.D.	I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
L271872	u5800	m383	VERONICA	It's over, J.D.  Over!
L271871	u5795	m383	J.D.	I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
L271870	u5800	m383	VERONICA	I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
L271869	u5795	m383	J.D.	Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
L271714	u5795	m383	J.D.	Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
L271713	u5800	m383	VERONICA	I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
L271712	u5795	m383	J.D.	Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
L271711	u5800	m383	VERONICA	You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
L271710	u5795	m383	J.D.	Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
L271709	u5800	m383	VERONICA	We're breaking up. I am out!
L271702	u5800	m383	VERONICA	May<u>be</u>.
L271701	u5795	m383	J.D.	Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
L271700	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
L271691	u5795	m383	J.D.	You kids are making too much damn noise.
L271690	u5800	m383	VERONICA	You can be so immature!
L271688	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
L271687	u5795	m383	J.D.	She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
L271686	u5800	m383	VERONICA	You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
L271678	u5795	m383	J.D.	I was just making it more special.
L271677	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Can't you see this is a special moment?
L271657	u5795	m383	J.D.	How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
L271656	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Your son's dead and you love him.
L271654	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
L271653	u5795	m383	J.D.	Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
L271649	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Did not.
L271648	u5795	m383	J.D.	Did to.
L271647	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Did not.
L271646	u5795	m383	J.D.	Did to.
L271645	u5800	m383	VERONICA	I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
L271644	u5795	m383	J.D.	You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
L271642	u5795	m383	J.D.	Of course.
L271641	u5800	m383	VERONICA	We killed them, didn't we?
L271622	u5795	m383	J.D.	Remember he's left-handed.
L271621	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Kurt doesn't look too good.
L271617	u5795	m383	J.D.	Don't move! I'll get him back!
L271616	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
L271615	u5795	m383	J.D.	Did you miss him completely?
L271598	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
L271597	u5795	m383	J.D.	This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
L271596	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
L271595	u5795	m383	J.D.	Perrier water!
L271594	u5795	m383	J.D.	You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...
L271593	u5800	m383	VERONICA	You must have had fun.
L271592	u5795	m383	J.D.	We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
L271591	u5795	m383	J.D.	Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
L271590	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Oh.
L271589	u5795	m383	J.D.	It doesn't work on small animals!
L271588	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
L271587	u5795	m383	J.D.	They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
L271586	u5800	m383	VERONICA	We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
L271585	u5795	m383	J.D.	Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
L271584	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
L271583	u5795	m383	J.D.	Incredible similarity.
L271582	u5800	m383	VERONICA	First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
L271580	u5800	m383	VERONICA	So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
L271579	u5795	m383	J.D.	These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
L271578	u5800	m383	VERONICA	French.
L271577	u5795	m383	J.D.	Do you take German?
L271576	u5800	m383	VERONICA	You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
L271575	u5795	m383	J.D.	Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
L271574	u5800	m383	VERONICA	I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
L271547	u5795	m383	J.D.	Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
L271546	u5800	m383	VERONICA	So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!
L271543	u5800	m383	VERONICA	I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
L271542	u5795	m383	J.D.	What is this shit?
L271488	u5795	m383	J.D.	Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
L271487	u5800	m383	VERONICA	My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
L271486	u5795	m383	J.D.	Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
L271476	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Yeah. Scary stuff.
L271475	u5795	m383	J.D.	Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
L271470	u5800	m383	VERONICA	Next channel, darling.
L271469	u5795	m383	J.D.	Mute!
L271416	u5800	m383	VERONICA	That's good. Have you done this before?
L271415	u5795	m383	J.D.	I die knowing no one knew the real me."

J.D.	Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
VERONICA	Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....

VERONICA	You're still not listening! I'm not..
J.D.	Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
VERONICA	This knife is filthy.
J.D.	What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
VERONICA	I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.

VERONICA	Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
J.D.	You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?

J.D.	If you'll excuse me......
VERONICA	No-o!

J.D.	I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
VERONICA	Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.

VERONICA	Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
J.D.	You didn't say Simon Says.

VERONICA	It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
J.D.	You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.

VERONICA	How do you turn the fucker off?
J.D.	You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
VERONICA	The bomb, asshole!
J.D.	Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
VERONICA	You know what I want, babe?
J.D.	What?

J.D.	You really fucked me up, Veronica.
VERONICA	I thought I...you..
J.D.	You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.

RAM	Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
KURT	Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
RAM	Let's kick his ass.
KURT	Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.

RAM	You going to eat this?
KURT	What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
RAM	Answer him dick!
KURT	Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?

KURT	We on tonight man?
RAM	I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
KURT	Pretty weird.

KURT	That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
RAM	Let's kick his ass.
KURT	Cool off, we're seniors.
RAM	Goddamn Geek!

KURT	Is it sleeping, dude?
RAM	I think so, man.
KURT	Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
RAM	Punch it in!

RAM	Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
KURT	Shut the fuck up, all right.
RAM	Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!

MOM	Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
VERONICA	I guess.
MOM	Any contestants worth mentioning?
VERONICA	May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.

MOM	You two....
VERONICA	Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.

MOM	Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
VERONICA	May<u>be</u>.

MOM	You two....
VERONICA	Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.

MOM	How was the funeral?
VERONICA	Superb.

MOM	Turn that back on!
VERONICA	This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.

VERONICA	Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
MOM	I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
VERONICA	All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.

PAULINE	Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
VERONICA	Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.

PAULINE	Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
VERONICA	But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
PAULINE	What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?

PAULINE	Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
VERONICA	Where is he? Where's J.D.?
PAULINE	We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
VERONICA	Get a job.

WHITNEY JAMES	Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
VERONICA	That's three things.
WHITNEY JAMES	It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.

WHITNEY JAMES	I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
VERONICA	But my name's not...
WHITNEY JAMES	People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?

VERONICA	I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
WHITNEY JAMES	Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.

VERONICA	The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
WHITNEY JAMES	Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
VERONICA	It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
WHITNEY JAMES	Sure. Ciao.

BUBBER	And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
BERNIE	Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
BUBBER	A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
BERNIE	Try stupid.

BERNIE	You got a drinking problem or what?
BUBBER	I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
BERNIE	Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
BUBBER	In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.

BUBBER	You should give it to someone with only one leg.
BERNIE	One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
BUBBER	I know a guy who only has one leg.

BERNIE	Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
BUBBER	They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
BERNIE	Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  "Keep a low profile," that's my motto.

BERNIE	Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
BUBBER	LaPlante!
BERNIE	Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.

BERNIE	I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
BUBBER	Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
BERNIE	In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.

BUBBER	That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
BERNIE	What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
BUBBER	That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
BERNIE	I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
BUBBER	I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
BERNIE	I was in the can, for Chrissake.
BUBBER	The bathroom!  For two days?
BERNIE	Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
BUBBER	You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
BERNIE	I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.

BUBBER	What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
BERNIE	Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?

BUBBER	You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
BERNIE	What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
BUBBER	And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
BERNIE	Right.

BERNIE	Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
BUBBER	Huh?  Whadda you mean?
BERNIE	Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
BUBBER	I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
BERNIE	Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
BUBBER	It was you!  I thought I heard...
BERNIE	I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
BUBBER	Allen?  He... he's okay?

BUBBER	You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
BERNIE	You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
BUBBER	Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
BERNIE	Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
BUBBER	--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.

BERNIE	You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
BUBBER	And give a deposition to the jUdge.
BERNIE	Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
BUBBER	On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
BERNIE	You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
BUBBER	I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
BERNIE	That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.

BERNIE	I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
BUBBER	Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
BERNIE	There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
BUBBER	Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
BERNIE	So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.

BUBBER	Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
BERNIE	Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.

BERNIE	What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
DONNA	I got your bail continued.
BERNIE	Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!

BERNIE	Anticipation of incarceration?
DONNA	He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
BERNIE	I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
DONNA	I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
BERNIE	He gives a good report and I walk?
DONNA	We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
BERNIE	Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
DONNA	And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
BERNIE	A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
DONNA	Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
BERNIE	Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
DONNA	I understand.  How often do you see your son?
BERNIE	Often, uh.
DONNA	How recently?
BERNIE	Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
DONNA	It's November.
BERNIE	She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
DONNA	I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.

DONNA	Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
BERNIE	Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.

DONNA	The Angel of Flight 104!  You're telling me you're the A...?
BERNIE	Angel!  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
DONNA	Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
BERNIE	Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.

BERNIE	Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
DONNA	I took a loan on my car and my computer.
BERNIE	You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
DONNA	I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
BERNIE	That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
DONNA	Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.

BERNIE	Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
DONNA	So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
BERNIE	Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
DONNA	I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
BERNIE	TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!

BERNIE	I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
DONNA	You mean John Bubber?

BERNIE	Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
DUKE	Mister LaPlante...
BERNIE	Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
DUKE	Mister LaPlante...
BERNIE	Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
DUKE	Mister LaPlante...
BERNIE	Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!

BERNIE	Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.
CHICK	Spanish kinda guys!
BERNIE	Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?

CHICK	What is it, five days now I don't see you!
BERNIE	'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?

CHICK	Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
BERNIE	My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
CHICK	You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
BERNIE	Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
CHICK	You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
BERNIE	I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?

CHICK	I didn't even know you had a kid.
BERNIE	The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
CHICK	We're all assholes, Bernie?
BERNIE	When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.

CHICK	Bernie, how'sa kid?
BERNIE	You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
CHICK	You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
BERNIE	You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?

BERNIE	Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
CHICK	I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.

BERNIE	What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
CHICK	You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
BERNIE	Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
CHICK	Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
BERNIE	I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
CHICK	It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
BERNIE	Nothin'.
CHICK	I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
BERNIE	The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
CHICK	Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...

BERNIE	Bill, I...
ROBINSON	DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
BERNIE	I...
ROBINSON	YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
BERNIE	Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
ROBINSON	THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
BERNIE	Bill, listen...
ROBINSON	OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
BERNIE	Bill, I got financial problems and...
ROBINSON	I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!

EVELYN	He waited for you three hours!
BERNIE	You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
EVELYN	I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
BERNIE	Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
EVELYN	It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
BERNIE	Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
EVELYN	He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
BERNIE	Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?

BERNIE	Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
EVELYN	The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?

BERNIE	That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
EVELYN	He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
BERNIE	Elliot?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
EVELYN	I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
BERNIE	Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
EVELYN	Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
BERNIE	The homeless!
EVELYN	How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!

BERNIE	Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
EVELYN	Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
EVELYN	Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.

BERNIE	You!
GALE	Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
BERNIE	Turn that thing off.
GALE	How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
BERNIE	How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
GALE	What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?

GALE	For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
BERNIE	Me!
GALE	If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
BERNIE	The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
GALE	Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.

BERNIE	My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
GALE	If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
BERNIE	What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
GALE	Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
BERNIE	Harassed.  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
GALE	He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
BERNIE	Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
GALE	A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
BERNIE	-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
GALE	You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
BERNIE	Underbelly!
GALE	In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.

GALE	All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
BERNIE	I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
GALE	I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
BERNIE	Lie, you mean...
GALE	Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
BERNIE	I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
GALE	Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!

GALE	I snuck in.
BERNIE	You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
GALE	Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
BERNIE	Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
GALE	Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
BERNIE	Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
GALE	Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?

BERNIE	This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
JOEY	Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
BERNIE	Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
JOEY	The Nomm?  What's that?
BERNIE	It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
JOEY	Were you in it?  In the war?
BERNIE	You never saw that picture, huh?
JOEY	What picture?
BERNIE	Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.

JOEY	Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
BERNIE	I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?

JOEY	Here.  Get off here.
BERNIE	Thanks.  Thanks, pal.

BERNIE	Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
JOEY	I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.

BERNIE	Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
JOEY	Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.

JOEY	Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
BERNIE	JOEY!

BERNIE	You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
JOEY	Uh, no.
BERNIE	Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?

BUBBER	Uh, er... I...
GALE	You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
BUBBER	Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
GALE	All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
BUBBER	Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --

GALE	Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
BUBBER	Yes.
GALE	...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.

BUBBER	Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
GALE	You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.

BUBBER	Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
GALE	John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.

GALE	Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
BUBBER	It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.

GALE	Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
BUBBER	Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...

GALE	I... I know that, John...
BUBBER	You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
GALE	You did save my life!  And it's <u>me</u>! I'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional...  I...

BUBBER	I... no... I don't have the right... I...
GALE	No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
BUBBER	Uh, right.  A... news story.

GALE	I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
BUBBER	Vietnam!
GALE	Goodnight, John.

GALE	You were... very... inspiring.
BUBBER	A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
GALE	Read it.  It'll be fine.

GALE	Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
BUBBER	Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
GALE	You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
BUBBER	That's not what I mean...
GALE	There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
BUBBER	Gale...
GALE	I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
BUBBER	Bodybuilding!

BUBBER	It's not right, Gale...
GALE	It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.

BUBBER	Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
GALE	John, I know all about it.
BUBBER	You do?

BUBBER	A little mistake!
GALE	No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...

GALE	Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
CHUCKY	Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.

GALE	What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
CHUCKY	I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...

CHUCKY	We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
GALE	Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
CHUCKY	Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
GALE	You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!

CHUCKY	What's the matter?
GALE	This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?

CHUCKY	What is it?
GALE	The...Silver...Mike...Award!
CHUCKY	This guy LaPlante won an award?
GALE	For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth.
CHUCKY	LaPlante!

CHUCKY	Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
GALE	And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.

CHUCKY	He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
GALE	Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?

GALE	It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
DEAKINS	Unprofessional.
GALE	You just can't bear the idea of good news.
DEAKINS	You're sitting on your ticket.

DEAKINS	She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
GALE	The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
DEAKINS	That too.
GALE	Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?

DEAKINS	There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
GALE	You said all the passengers were accounted for...
DEAKINS	Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...

DEAKINS	We're piecing together different accounts and...
GALE	A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?

GALE	There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
DEAKINS	WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?

DEAKINS	How'd it go?
GALE	He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.

DEAKINS	He's right.  It's unprofessional.
WALLACE	If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.

DEAKINS	Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
WALLACE	You wouldn't push the guy, would you?

WALLACE	Ticket!  What's going on?
DEAKINS	She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
WALLACE	A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!

DEAKINS	Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
WALLACE	It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.
DEAKINS	We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
WALLACE	What about a reward for coming forward?

WALLACE	I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
DEAKINS	Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
WALLACE	Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
DEAKINS	Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.

WALLACE	Upset!  What's he upset about?
DEAKINS	Said he's not an actor.
WALLACE	He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
DEAKINS	She's talking to him now.
WALLACE	We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.

DEAKINS	Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
WALLACE	Quit?  She wants to quit?
DEAKINS	Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!

WALLACE	She wants to quit?
DEAKINS	She can't quit.

DEAKINS	Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
WALLACE	Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
DEAKINS	Helluva story!
WALLACE	No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.

WALLACE	It's not unthinkable.
DEAKINS	What?
WALLACE	The Presidency.  The public loves him.
DEAKINS	For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.

JOEY	He lost a shoe!
EVELYN	Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
JOEY	The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.

JOEY	My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
EVELYN	You were in bed.  Weren't you?
JOEY	I... I saw him out the window.

EVELYN	My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
JOEY	Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?

EVELYN	If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
JOEY	What's "cynical"?
EVELYN	It's when you say, "Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?"  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God...

EVELYN	Oh my God!  Bernie!
JOEY	Dad!

GALE	Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
WALLACE	Never reach out!
GALE	Hello, Mister Wallace.

GALE	I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
WALLACE	You didn't?
GALE	I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.

GALE	I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
WALLACE	An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...

WINSTON	LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
GALE	We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
WINSTON	This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
GALE	We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...

GALE	Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
WINSTON	Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!

WINSTON	No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
GALE	I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...

JOAN	There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
GALE	Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?

JOAN	Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
GALE	He's pretty... remarkable.
JOAN	You didn't... get it on with him?
GALE	Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
JOAN	Reporters don't have hormones?
GALE	Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.

PARKER	Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
GALE	What about?
PARKER	I didn't ask him.
GALE	Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.

PARKER	Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
GALE	Who?
PARKER	Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
GALE	Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?

AD MAN #1	We'll call it the Flying Donut!
AD MAN #2	The Dancing Dingus!
AD MAN #1	The Jerky Circle!

AD MAN #1	Something short.
AD MAN #2	Sharp.
AD MAN #1	Snappy.
AD MAN #2	With a little jazz.
AD MAN #1	The Shazzammeter!
AD MAN #2	The Hipster!

AD MAN #1	The Daddy-Oh!
AD MAN #2	The Circle-o'-Gaiety!

AD MAN #1	The Hoopsucker!
AD MAN #2	The Hudswinger!
AD MAN #1	The Hoop-dee-doo!
AD MAN #2	The Hudsucker Hoop!

ADDISON	My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
MUSSBURGER	What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
ADDISON	He didn't look unhappy!

ADDISON	Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
MUSSBURGER	We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
ADDISON	I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
ADDISON	Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!

AMY	Who are you? How did you know who I am?
MOSES	Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
AMY	But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
MOSES	Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
AMY	Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
MOSES	I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
AMY	So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
MOSES	Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
AMY	That smart?!
MOSES	But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
AMY	Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
MOSES	'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...

MOSES	...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
AMY	Well, maybe I --
MOSES	An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
AMY	It's hardly the same --
MOSES	Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
AMY	Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
MOSES	I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
AMY	I'm happy enough.
MOSES	Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
AMY	I'm plenty happy!

AMY	...Hello?
MOSES	Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...

AMY	And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
SMITTY	Adenoids?
AMY	Lumbago.

AMY	I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
SMITTY	Yeah.

SMITTY	About seven minutes.
AMY	Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --

AMY	I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
SMITTY	He didn't offer you money.
AMY	A sawbuck!
SMITTY	Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
AMY	On Norville Barnes!

SMITTY	Ol' satchel-butt...
AMY	I know they're gonna buy that stock --

SMITTY	-- and she's dynamite!
AMY	But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!

AMY	Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
SMITTY	You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
AMY	Muncie!

AMY	I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
NORVILLE	Not at all. You're light as a feather.
AMY	The couch, please.

NORVILLE	Hungry, anyway.
AMY	I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...

AMY	What a horrible little person.
NORVILLE	Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
AMY	At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --

AMY	A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
NORVILLE	I myself --

NORVILLE	Cigarette?
AMY	No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --

AMY	-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
NORVILLE	Mind if I join you?

NORVILLE	You're from Muncie?!
AMY	Why yes, do you know it?

NORVILLE	...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
AMY	Oh, no, really, I --
NORVILLE	Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.

NORVILLE	Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
AMY	Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!

NORVILLE	-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
AMY	Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
NORVILLE	Please! Norville!

NORVILLE	...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
AMY	Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
NORVILLE	The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
AMY	-- or lack thereof?
NORVILLE	-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.

AMY	Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
NORVILLE	...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
AMY	I'm sure I --
NORVILLE	Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
AMY	Well, I --
NORVILLE	Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?

NORVILLE	...You know! For kids!
AMY	...Why don't I just type this up...
NORVILLE	Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
AMY	Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
NORVILLE	Well, she probably had a deadline...
AMY	Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
NORVILLE	Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...

AMY	Confused?
NORVILLE	Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
AMY	I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
NORVILLE	Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
AMY	Oh, is that it!
NORVILLE	Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
AMY	Smitty.
NORVILLE	Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
AMY	Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
NORVILLE	I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --

AMY	...What happened?
NORVILLE	Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
AMY	Let me look.

NORVILLE	Sid found me the icepack.
AMY	Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
NORVILLE	Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
AMY	...I'm sorry.
NORVILLE	Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.

AMY	Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
NORVILLE	I know that, Amy.
AMY	...You do?
NORVILLE	I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
AMY	I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
NORVILLE	Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
AMY	Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...

AMY	...Certain people are --
NORVILLE	Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
AMY	...Huh?
NORVILLE	You know, on farm route 17.
AMY	Oh yes! In Muncie!
NORVILLE	No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
AMY	Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
NORVILLE	You don't say.
AMY	Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
NORVILLE	Every year?
AMY	Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --

AMY	...The people look like ants.
NORVILLE	Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
AMY	What a beautiful thought.
NORVILLE	What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
AMY	Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
NORVILLE	Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
AMY	Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
NORVILLE	That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
AMY	I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
NORVILLE	Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.

AMY	Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
NORVILLE	That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...

AMY	Oh, Norville --
NORVILLE	Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
AMY	Sure, Norville, sure...

AMY	For Pete's sake, Norville!
NORVILLE	Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
AMY	Never mind about that...

AMY	...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
NORVILLE	Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
AMY	They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
NORVILLE	Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
AMY	You mean you know about this?
NORVILLE	Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
AMY	Your i --
NORVILLE	We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
AMY	You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!

AMY	...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
NORVILLE	Now, Aim --
AMY	Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
NORVILLE	Now, Aim --
AMY	Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
NORVILLE	Now, Aim --
AMY	Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
NORVILLE	Worked in a watch factory?

NORVILLE	Now, Amy --
AMY	Consider this my resignation --

NORVILLE	...You son of a --
AMY	Norville!
NORVILLE	Huh?!

NORVILLE	...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
AMY	Oh Norville, I --

NORVILLE	Barman! Set'm up, fella!
AMY	Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
NORVILLE	Hey! Where's that martini?!
AMY	Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
NORVILLE	Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
AMY	Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!

AMY	I tell ya the guy's a phony.
EDITOR	Phony, huh?
AMY	As a three-dollar bill.
EDITOR	Sez who?
AMY	Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...

AMY	...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
EDITOR	Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
AMY	I filed it yesterday.
EDITOR	Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!

CHIEF	I can't print this!
AMY	Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
CHIEF	It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!

CHIEF	You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
AMY	I don't know...

AMY	Muncie.
CHIEF	Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
AMY	I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
CHIEF	Watch it, Archer --
AMY	It's about a dimwitted editor who --

AMY	You can't print that!
CHIEF	He grins wolfishly.

CHIEF	Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
AMY	Says who?!

CHIEF	Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
AMY	You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
CHIEF	Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.

NORVILLE	Just got hired today!
ANCIENT SORTER	Terrific.
NORVILLE	Ya know, entry level!
ANCIENT SORTER	Tell me about it.
NORVILLE	I got big ideas, though!
ANCIENT SORTER	I'm sure you do.
NORVILLE	For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...

ANCIENT SORTER	Terrific.
NORVILLE	So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
ANCIENT SORTER	Nooo, I don't guess you will be.

NORVILLE	How long've you been down here?
ANCIENT SORTER	Forty-eight years...

NORVILLE	I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
BARMAN	Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
NORVILLE	I thought you served misfits here!

BARMAN	Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
NORVILLE	What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
BARMAN	It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
NORVILLE	I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
BARMAN	Martinis are for squares, man.

BENNY	What the heck's she doin', Lou?
LOU	What the heck they doin'?

BENNY	You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
LOU	This I know, Benny.
BENNY	This you're familia' with.

LOU	...Geez.
BENNY	...Geez.

BENNY	...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
LOU	It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.

BUZZ	...What's your pleasure, buddy?
NORVILLE	Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
BUZZ	Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
NORVILLE	I --
BUZZ	Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!

BUZZ	Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
NORVILLE	Well, I --
BUZZ	Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!

BUZZ	My pleasure, sir.
NORVILLE	Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --

NORVILLE	Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
BUZZ	I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!

NORVILLE	...Why, this is worthless.
BUZZ	Huh?! But, buddy --

NORVILLE	This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
BUZZ	Yeah, but, buddy --
NORVILLE	Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...

NORVILLE	...say, the hula hoop such a success.
BUZZ	But, buddy --
NORVILLE	And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
BUZZ	But, buddy, you were --
NORVILLE	-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
BUZZ	Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
NORVILLE	An example must be made!

BUZZ	Wuddya mean, buddy?
NORVILLE	Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!

BUZZ	Awwww, buddy --
NORVILLE	And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!

BUZZ	Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
NORVILLE	Get up!
BUZZ	I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
NORVILLE	We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!

BUZZ	I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
NORVILLE	Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

NORVILLE	-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
BUZZ	Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.

NORVILLE	...You don't?
BUZZ	Nah, that's all forgotten.
NORVILLE	...It is?
BUZZ	Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
NORVILLE	Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
BUZZ	But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
NORVILLE	But, Buzz --
BUZZ	Say, that was a swell idea!
NORVILLE	But, Buzz, you know I never --
BUZZ	And Sid says you stole it!
NORVILLE	But Buzz --

HUDSUCKER	...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
NORVILLE	Norville.
HUDSUCKER	Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
NORVILLE	Yes sir...
HUDSUCKER	Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
NORVILLE	Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
HUDSUCKER	It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.

NORVILLE	Oh, geez.
HUDSUCKER	Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
NORVILLE	Geez, I --
HUDSUCKER	Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
NORVILLE	Yessir.
HUDSUCKER	Well, why don't ya read it.
NORVILLE	Sir?
HUDSUCKER	Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
NORVILLE	Yes sir...

NORVILLE	'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
HUDSUCKER	Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
NORVILLE	'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?

NORVILLE	'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
HUDSUCKER	-- tough titty toenails!

HUDSUCKER	...Yeah, go ahead.
NORVILLE	'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'

NORVILLE	...This'll only take a moment.
INTERCOM	Yeah?
NORVILLE	Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
INTERCOM	Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!

NORVILLE	...Well, I'm not sure where I --
INTERCOM	I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
NORVILLE	But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
INTERCOM	I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!

MRS. MUSSBURGER	-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
NORVILLE	That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
MRS. MUSSBURGER	Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!

MRS. MUSSBURGER	I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
NORVILLE	I haven't had --
MRS. MUSSBURGER	Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?

MRS. MUSSBURGER	Well, frankly, I...
NORVILLE	You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.

MUSSBURGER	...Who let you in?
NORVILLE	I --

MUSSBURGER	Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
NORVILLE	I --

MUSSBURGER	You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
NORVILLE	You --

NORVILLE	...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
MUSSBURGER	Wait a minute!

MUSSBURGER	...education, were you?
NORVILLE	Well, I'm a college graduate --
MUSSBURGER	All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
NORVILLE	Well, I made the dean's list.
MUSSBURGER	Hmmm.

NORVILLE	At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?

MUSSBURGER	...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
NORVILLE	No, sir.
MUSSBURGER	Not even behind your back?
NORVILLE	Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
MUSSBURGER	You're fired.
NORVILLE	But, sir! --
MUSSBURGER	Get your feet off that desk.

NORVILLE	But --
MUSSBURGER	Get out of my sight.

MUSSBURGER	My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!

MUSSBURGER	You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!

MUSSBURGER	Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!

MUSSBURGER	Not that way! Through the door!
NORVILLE	But, sir!

MUSSBURGER	Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
NORVILLE	Sir, my leg is on fire!

MUSSBURGER	My God! The Bumstead contracts!
NORVILLE	Oh my God, sir!

NORVILLE	That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
MUSSBURGER	Lobby. We haven't got all day.

MUSSBURGER	Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
NORVILLE	Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --

NORVILLE	...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
MUSSBURGER	I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
NORVILLE	Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
MUSSBURGER	Damnit, where's my car!
NORVILLE	-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --

MUSSBURGER	Finally.
NORVILLE	-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --

MUSSBURGER	...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
NORVILLE	Well... I'm for it...

NORVILLE	Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
MUSSBURGER	Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
NORVILLE	Ya don't say.
MUSSBURGER	Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
NORVILLE	How's that, Sid?
MUSSBURGER	It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
NORVILLE	Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
MUSSBURGER	Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...

VETERAN #1	I got gas, Bennie.
VETERAN #2	Yeah, tell me about it.
VETERAN #1	No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
VETERAN #2	Ya get the special?
VETERAN #1	Fah from it...

VETERAN #1	...Enter the dame.
VETERAN #2	There's one in every story.

VETERAN #2	Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.

VETERAN #2	She finds him.
VETERAN #1	She sits down.

VETERAN #2	...and awduhs a light lunch.
VETERAN #1	She looks in her purse...

VETERAN #2	...No money.
VETERAN #1	The mark notices.

VETERAN #2	...He's not noticing, Benny.
VETERAN #1	Maybe he's wise.
VETERAN #2	He don't look wise.

VETERAN #1	No, Bennie: Lumbago.

VETERAN #2	Maybe he's wise.
VETERAN #1	He don't look wise.

VETERAN #1	She isn't!
VETERAN #2	She is!

VETERAN #1	She's good, Bennie.
VETERAN #2	She's damn good, Lou.









JERRY	Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
L326772	u6130	m408	AVERY	And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
L326771	u6136	m408	JERRY	The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
L326621	u6136	m408	JERRY	One of the accountants.

L326617	u6130	m408	AVERY	Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
L326616	u6136	m408	JERRY	You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
L326613	u6130	m408	AVERY	Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
L326612	u6136	m408	JERRY	Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
L326611	u6130	m408	AVERY	Don't ever stop fucking me!
L327182	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Still going.
L327181	u6131	m408	CHAD	Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
L327180	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	He's asleep, right?
L327142	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
L327141	u6131	m408	CHAD	Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
L327140	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Don't let him stay up too late.
L326829	u6131	m408	CHAD	Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
L326828	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Wait.  Did I just say hon" to him?
AVERY	Ugh!
JERRY	Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.

AVERY	Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
JERRY	I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
AVERY	Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
JERRY	That's right.
AVERY	King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
JERRY	Okay, this is working.
AVERY	You are not a loser.

JERRY	Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
AVERY	I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?

JERRY	Now.
AVERY	Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.

JERRY	I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
AVERY	Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
JERRY	Well, no you didn't --
AVERY	You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
JERRY	It's a plan --  -- _ 51.

JERRY	This can't be happening to me.
AVERY	Jerry!  Do something --

AVERY	I just heard.
JERRY	What do I do?  How do I spin this?
AVERY	Oh honey.  It's spun.

AVERY	It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
JERRY	Could you just stop moving?
AVERY	I have to finish my job --
JERRY	Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --

AVERY	Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
JERRY	Look, I don't want a --
AVERY	It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
JERRY	Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.

JERRY	Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
AVERY	What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
JERRY	I think you added the "brutal."

AVERY	Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
JERRY	-- stop --

JERRY	Listen to me!
AVERY	No.
JERRY	It's over --

AVERY	Didn't hear it.
JERRY	There is something missing here.
AVERY	You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
JERRY	Listen to me, it's over.

AVERY	No one has ever dumped me.
JERRY	I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.

AVERY	I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
JERRY	No.

AVERY	Oh Jerry.
JERRY	You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.









CUSH	It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
L326895	u6136	m408	JERRY	Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
L326855	u6136	m408	JERRY	Wait.  What do you mean?
L326854	u6132	m408	CUSH	I see what you're saying.
L326853	u6136	m408	JERRY	Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
L327253	u6133	m408	DOOLER	Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
L327252	u6136	m408	JERRY	Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
L327247	u6136	m408	JERRY	Bill, Rod, wait --
L327246	u6133	m408	DOOLER	Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
L326636	u6133	m408	DOOLER	They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
L326635	u6136	m408	JERRY	... this is... uh... too funny...
L326627	u6136	m408	JERRY	You're imagining it.
L326626	u6133	m408	DOOLER	This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
L326625	u6136	m408	JERRY	Oh come on --
L326624	u6133	m408	DOOLER	You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
L327456	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
L327455	u6136	m408	JERRY	This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
L327392	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
L327391	u6136	m408	JERRY	So this break... is a break-up.
L327390	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
L327389	u6136	m408	JERRY	What about Ray?
L327388	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
JERRY	Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
CUSH	Something in the way.  Yeah.

CUSH	Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
JERRY	Just be friendly and say "no comment."
CUSH	Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.









JERRY	No no...
DOROTHY	Oh, tell the story.

JERRY	Can I help?
DOROTHY	Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
JERRY	I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
DOROTHY	Hmm.  Pretty good.
JERRY	Now what did you lose?
DOROTHY	My son... my mind...

DOROTHY	Well, thanks.
JERRY	Well, take care.
DOROTHY	And have fun at your bachelor party.

DOROTHY	Oh no.
JERRY	No no. I knew.
DOROTHY	Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
JERRY	No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.

DOROTHY	I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
JERRY	You think so?
DOROTHY	Oh tsht. Yes.
JERRY	I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
DOROTHY	-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --

DOROTHY	Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
JERRY	Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.

JERRY	Wonder what he said.
DOROTHY	My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.

DOROTHY	So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
JERRY	Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.

DOROTHY	And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
JERRY	Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
DOROTHY	No no, I know --

JERRY	But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
DOROTHY	Absolutely.

DOROTHY	That took guts.
JERRY	Same to you.

DOROTHY	Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
JERRY	Hello?
DOROTHY	Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.

JERRY	No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
DOROTHY	Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...

DOROTHY	... light.
JERRY	Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --

JERRY	Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
DOROTHY	We are?
JERRY	It's all going to work.
DOROTHY	I just got goosebumps.

JERRY	It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
DOROTHY	Well, I'm happy for you.
JERRY	Happy for us.

DOROTHY	Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
JERRY	Thanks.
DOROTHY	Call me later, hon.

DOROTHY	Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
JERRY	Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.

DOROTHY	Hey you.
JERRY	Hi.

JERRY	Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
DOROTHY	He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
JERRY	I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...

DOROTHY	Oh my God.
JERRY	Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.

DOROTHY	Too bad.
JERRY	Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
DOROTHY	Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
JERRY	And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.

DOROTHY	Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
JERRY	Do you have something to drink?
DOROTHY	Sure --

DOROTHY	Beer okay?
JERRY	Yeah, thanks.

DOROTHY	Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
JERRY	Good idea.  Thank you.

DOROTHY	Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
JERRY	We will be fine!
DOROTHY	-- especially one like this.
JERRY	And I am...

DOROTHY	Truth?
JERRY	Sure.

JERRY	Me too.
DOROTHY	What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.

DOROTHY	I'm working with you because of that memo...
JERRY	Mission... statement...

DOROTHY	Well.
JERRY	Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
DOROTHY	Don't worry about it, boss.
JERRY	Oh shit.  You said "boss."
DOROTHY	Yeah, I did.
JERRY	Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
DOROTHY	No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
JERRY	No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
DOROTHY	I may not sue.

JERRY	Well, good evening.
DOROTHY	Good evening.

DOROTHY	Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
JERRY	Happy. He said "happy?"
DOROTHY	Actually he said "glad." _ 85.

JERRY	Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
DOROTHY	Plus, you could use that commission.

JERRY	I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
DOROTHY	You don't have to explain.
JERRY	Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
DOROTHY	Yeah, what happened there.
JERRY	We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
DOROTHY	I'm relieved you said that.
JERRY	I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
DOROTHY	Oh good.
JERRY	You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
DOROTHY	Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.

JERRY	Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
DOROTHY	Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
JERRY	Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...

DOROTHY	We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
JERRY	Bye you guys. _ 88.

JERRY	It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
DOROTHY	Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --

DOROTHY	Maybe you should call her.
JERRY	No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?

DOROTHY	Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
JERRY	What?
DOROTHY	Let's not tell our sad stories.

JERRY	Well -- this would be goodnight.
DOROTHY	Good night.

DOROTHY	I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
JERRY	Same to you.
DOROTHY	No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
JERRY	Right.  I'll come in.
DOROTHY	Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
JERRY	Oh hell yes.

DOROTHY	Oh God.
JERRY	Easy, easy --

JERRY	Another time, okay Dorothy?
DOROTHY	Fine, I just --
JERRY	And I appreciate that impulse.

JERRY	Sure you're okay to drive this?
DOROTHY	This rig? Phht.  No problem.
JERRY	So I'll see you this weekend.

JERRY	What --
DOROTHY	Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.

JERRY	If I said that, would you stay?
DOROTHY	No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
JERRY	Will you marry me?

JERRY	I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
DOROTHY	Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.

DOROTHY	And I really don't know your noises yet.
JERRY	Well, when you wonder, ask me.
DOROTHY	Okay... I will...

JERRY	Why do you love me?
DOROTHY	Why do you love me?

DOROTHY	It's my fault.
JERRY	What --
DOROTHY	It's not fair to you.  This whole --
JERRY	Tell me -- let me help --
DOROTHY	I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
JERRY	Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
DOROTHY	I don't need you to "stick."
JERRY	You want...
DOROTHY	I don't know --
JERRY	...my soul or something. _ 117.

DOROTHY	Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
JERRY	Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
DOROTHY	I think we made a mistake here.

JERRY	What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
DOROTHY	I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
JERRY	I don't like to give up.





LAUREL	What about medical?
DOROTHY	Of course, medical! _ 42.

LAUREL	You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
DOROTHY	If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
LAUREL	You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
DOROTHY	Of course I know --

DOROTHY	Wait. Where is he?
LAUREL	He's in the living room asleep.

DOROTHY	He's coming over.
LAUREL	At eleven at night? _ 70.

DOROTHY	He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
LAUREL	Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
DOROTHY	Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.

LAUREL	I heard.
DOROTHY	No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
LAUREL	This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
DOROTHY	Thank you.
LAUREL	Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.

DOROTHY	That's the girl I love.
LAUREL	But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
DOROTHY	As opposed to twenty angry women?

DOROTHY	I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
LAUREL	Good.
DOROTHY	Thanks.

LAUREL	Forgot your keys --
DOROTHY	That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.

LAUREL	No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
DOROTHY	Oh, knock it off! _ 89.

LAUREL	First you gotta tell me something.
DOROTHY	No--

LAUREL	Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
DOROTHY	Please, if I start talking --
LAUREL	Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.

LAUREL	Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
DOROTHY	Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.

TIDWELL	No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
FIRESTONE	-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
TIDWELL	I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
FIRESTONE	It's only a half-hour show, Rod.

TIDWELL	Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
FIRESTONE	Ten seconds, Rod.
TIDWELL	And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...

JERRY	Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
MATT	We decided to stay with you.

JERRY	Oh, thank you.
MATT	Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
JERRY	You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.

MATT	I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
JERRY	It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.

MATT	Denver is where he should be.
JERRY	I'll give it everything.
MATT	You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.

MATT	What happened to Denver?
JERRY	Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.

MATT	Not right now, Jerry.
JERRY	Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?

MATT	Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
JERRY	Said who?  Sugar?
MATT	Hey, I'm learning as I go.
JERRY	So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
MATT	I'm sorry, I --
JERRY	I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.

JERRY	Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
MATT	We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.

TIDWELL	Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
JERRY	Okay.

TIDWELL	Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
JERRY	Now you want Arizona dollars.
TIDWELL	Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --

TIDWELL	--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
JERRY	Mmm.  Hmm.
TIDWELL	It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
JERRY	Yes.
TIDWELL	Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.

JERRY	I got it.
TIDWELL	Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.

JERRY	Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
TIDWELL	Congratulations.  You're still my agent.

JERRY	At last I find you.
TIDWELL	Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.

TIDWELL	I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
JERRY	Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
TIDWELL	Let's do it again.

TIDWELL	You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
JERRY	I gotta get back to Cushman.
TIDWELL	Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...

TIDWELL	You're loving me now, aren't ya?
JERRY	I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."

TIDWELL	Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
JERRY	Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
TIDWELL	Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
JERRY	Call me tomorrow.
TIDWELL	I might call you later!

TIDWELL	You love me now, don't you?
JERRY	Very much.

JERRY	Rod --
TIDWELL	You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
JERRY	What are you doing with me, Rod?
TIDWELL	Huh?
JERRY	Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!

JERRY	See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
TIDWELL	Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
JERRY	The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
TIDWELL	No.
JERRY	It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.

TIDWELL	You are not allowed to act this way.
JERRY	Why not?

TIDWELL	Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
JERRY	Another drink please.
TIDWELL	Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
JERRY	Oh my God.

TIDWELL	Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
JERRY	Uh, not today, but --
TIDWELL	John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
JERRY	I understand your anxiety.
TIDWELL	Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...

TIDWELL	--  the kwan.
JERRY	That's your word?
TIDWELL	Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
JERRY	But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.

TIDWELL	I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
JERRY	Great word.  Towel?
TIDWELL	No, I air-dry.
JERRY	Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --

TIDWELL	Is that your porty or mine?
JERRY	You.

TIDWELL	You're telling me to dance.
JERRY	No, I'm saying to be --

TIDWELL	Love me love me love me... put me on t.v.  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
JERRY	Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?

TIDWELL	Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
JERRY	Fine.

TIDWELL	What's wrong.
JERRY	Forget it.  Forget it.
TIDWELL	No tell me. _ 84.

JERRY	I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
TIDWELL	You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.

JERRY	If you get injured, you get nothing.
TIDWELL	Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
JERRY	It's a risk.

JERRY	I'll get you some quick work --
TIDWELL	Good deal, man.

TIDWELL	Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
JERRY	Rod, get on the camel.

JERRY	Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
TIDWELL	Oh, we gonna be friends now?
JERRY	What do you know about dating a single mother?

TIDWELL	Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
JERRY	Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.

TIDWELL	First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
JERRY	How do I know?
TIDWELL	You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
JERRY	No, I don't know.
TIDWELL	Then you gotta have The Talk.
JERRY	But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
TIDWELL	Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.

JERRY	The kid is amazing.
TIDWELL	No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
JERRY	I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
TIDWELL	Shame on you.  SHAME on you.

TIDWELL	You never had The Talk, did you?
JERRY	No.
TIDWELL	Well, this was another way to go.

TIDWELL	Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
JERRY	I'm a little worried --
TIDWELL	I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.

JERRY	We can still take the offer, Rod.
TIDWELL	No.

JERRY	Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
TIDWELL	Hey, that's my word, okay?

TIDWELL	I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
JERRY	Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
TIDWELL	Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
JERRY	What's that supposed to mean?
TIDWELL	Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
JERRY	I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
TIDWELL	You don't want to go home, do you?
JERRY	Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
TIDWELL	I'm asking you a question --
JERRY	No, you're --
TIDWELL	I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?

JERRY	Not everyone has what you have.
TIDWELL	Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
JERRY	You're jabbing at me. _ 112.

TIDWELL	I'm sorry I asked.
JERRY	No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
TIDWELL	That's an answer.
JERRY	Damn right.
TIDWELL	For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
JERRY	Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
TIDWELL	Why not --
JERRY	Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
TIDWELL	I think so.
JERRY	Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.

TIDWELL	I don't want to be friends anymore.
JERRY	Fine.
TIDWELL	Beautiful.
JERRY	We still having dinner in L.A.?
TIDWELL	Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!

TIDWELL	Jerry!  You made it --
JERRY	Go.  Flee.

TIDWELL	Thanks for coming.
JERRY	I missed ya.  What can I say?

JERRY	I have to ask.
WOMAN	What --
JERRY	Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?

WOMAN	You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
JERRY	Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
WOMAN	Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
JERRY	Well.  Good luck with that --

WOMAN	And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
JERRY	I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
WOMAN	It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.

JERRY	I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
WOMAN	Tell me, and then you can sleep.
JERRY	She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...

WOMAN	Oh, tell the story.
JERRY	--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
WOMAN	Gorgeous.
JERRY	A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
WOMAN	That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
JERRY	Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
WOMAN	To the pools?
JERRY	To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
WOMAN	Oh no -- _ 14.

JERRY	Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
WOMAN	How sad --
JERRY	But wait...

JERRY	Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
WOMAN	Jerry.  You two will be together forever.

JERRY	Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
MARCEE	Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!

JERRY	How can I make your life better?
MARCEE	I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.

MARCEE	You gonna get that --
JERRY	Not a chance.

JERRY	Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
MARCEE	Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
JERRY	Damn right.

JERRY	I'll go back to them.
MARCEE	And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"

JERRY	Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
MARCEE	What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.

JERRY	Marcee --
MARCEE	What DO you stand for???

MARCEE	I'm sorry what I said back there.
JERRY	Don't be silly.
MARCEE	My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.

JERRY	He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
MARCEE	I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
JERRY	Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
MARCEE	Stay calm?  I'm freakin...
JERRY	Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.

JERRY	Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
SUGAR	The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.

SUGAR	Cronin's okay for lunch?
JERRY	Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
SUGAR	Pleasure.

JERRY	Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
SUGAR	You okay?
JERRY	I'm fine.  What's up?
SUGAR	I came here to let you go. _ 27.

JERRY	Pardon me?
SUGAR	Came here to fire you, Jerry.

JERRY	Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
SUGAR	I know.  It sucks.  I suck.

JERRY	You...
SUGAR	You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --

SUGAR	... dick?
JERRY	Dick.

SUGAR	Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
JERRY	You'll lose.
SUGAR	You wanted smaller.
JERRY	I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
SUGAR	Jerry --
JERRY	-- and I'll get 'em.
SUGAR	You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --

JERRY	SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
SUGAR	I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.

RAY	One-two-three, swing.
JERRY	Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?

JERRY	Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
RAY	No.
JERRY	They do, my brother.
RAY	I'm not your brother!

RAY	Hi.
JERRY	Hi Ray.

RAY	And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
JERRY	Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
RAY	Let's go the zoo.
JERRY	Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.

RAY	Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
JERRY	Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
RAY	You said "fuck".
JERRY	Yeah I know.  I did.

RAY	I won't tell.
JERRY	We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.

RAY	I don't see any.
JERRY	Funny.
RAY	Funny...   I better go to bed.

RAY	What's going on, Jerry?
JERRY	A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.

RAY	Show me the animal, Jerry!
JERRY	Right up ahead, buddy --

JERRY	-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
RAY	I'm scared.  What is it?
JERRY	It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...

MARCEE	Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
TEE PEE	That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...

TEE PEE	He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
MARCEE	Can you be quiet?
TEE PEE	What'd I say?

TEE PEE	He should have kept his head tucked down.
MARCEE	Shut up!!!
TEE PEE	I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.

ANNA	-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
KAFKA	Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?

ANNA	You work in the insurance department?
KAFKA	You have been hearing the sordid side then.

ANNA	Where do you live?
KAFKA	Up there.

KAFKA	It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
ANNA	What is it really?
KAFKA	A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
ANNA	Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.

KAFKA	My assistants, I presume.
ASSISTANTS	Yes -- that's us.

KAFKA	You look like brothers.
ASSISTANTS	Yes -- we do.
KAFKA	Have you worked here long?
ASSISTANTS	No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.

ASSISTANTS	Fine -- terrible.
KAFKA	What was the matter with it?

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
BEARDED ANARCHIST	You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
BEARDED ANARCHIST	You were his friend.  One link is all they need.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Merely in the interests of order.
BEARDED ANARCHIST	The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
BEARDED ANARCHIST	-- Small.

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
BEARDED ANARCHIST	Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.

BIZZLEBEK	I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
KAFKA	I don't know what you could have read.
BIZZLEBEK	Just what you've published.
KAFKA	-- In magazines nobody reads.
BIZZLEBEK	I read the one about the penal colony.
KAFKA	Did you?
BIZZLEBEK	The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.

KAFKA	Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
BIZZLEBEK	-- In what sense?

BIZZLEBEK	These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
KAFKA	Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
BIZZLEBEK	Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
KAFKA	I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
BIZZLEBEK	Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.

KAFKA	That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
BIZZLEBEK	Success or nothing?
KAFKA	No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me.

KAFKA	You work in the cemetery.
BIZZLEBEK	A man must eat --  And drink.
KAFKA	The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.

BIZZLEBEK	-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
KAFKA	The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --

KAFKA	-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
BIZZLEBEK	There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
KAFKA	I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
BIZZLEBEK	What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
KAFKA	The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
BIZZLEBEK	In a manner of speaking.

BIZZLEBEK	I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
KAFKA	An empty tomb?
BIZZLEBEK	A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --

BIZZLEBEK	The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
KAFKA	Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.

KAFKA	-- You appreciate my writing.
BIZZLEBEK	Yes.
KAFKA	Will you do me a favor then?
BIZZLEBEK	Another one?
KAFKA	If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
BIZZLEBEK	What an extraordinary request!
KAFKA	It's my last and final one.
BIZZLEBEK	Then its authority is in doubt.
KAFKA	A true friend would do it.
BIZZLEBEK	Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.

BURGEL	The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
KAFKA	I gave it to him yesterday.
BURGEL	You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
KAFKA	No, I left it in his office.
BURGEL	Did you see him?
KAFKA	I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
BURGEL	He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
KAFKA	He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
BURGEL	Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.

BURGEL	In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
KAFKA	Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
BURGEL	But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
KAFKA	Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
BURGEL	When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
KAFKA	I'll commit that to memory.

BURGEL	Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
KAFKA	Yes.

BURGEL	Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
GABRIELA	Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
BURGEL	Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
GABRIELA	Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
BURGEL	It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
GABRIELA	You're just doing your job.
BURGEL	It's what I'm paid to do.
GABRIELA	You're detestable.
BURGEL	And you're late!

KAFKA	You wanted to see me, sir.
CHIEF CLERK	Sit down, Kafka.

CHIEF CLERK	You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
KAFKA	... My ... social situation?
CHIEF CLERK	You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.

KAFKA	To do my work well, I have little time for --
CHIEF CLERK	You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
KAFKA	I usually take lunch by the River.
CHIEF CLERK	It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
KAFKA	I did not realize it was obligatory.
CHIEF CLERK	Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
KAFKA	No, sir.
CHIEF CLERK	Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
KAFKA	Well, I --
CHIEF CLERK	Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?
KAFKA	-- Eduard --
CHIEF CLERK	-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.

CHIEF CLERK	I understand you fancy yourself an author.
KAFKA	In a small way.
CHIEF CLERK	You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.

KAFKA	Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
CHIEF CLERK	I do.
KAFKA	I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.

CHIEF CLERK	Was there something else?
KAFKA	No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
CHIEF CLERK	No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
KAFKA	I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
CHIEF CLERK	The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
KAFKA	Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.

KAFKA	I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
GABRIELA	I know.
KAFKA	You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
GABRIELA	Why would you suppose so?
KAFKA	Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
GABRIELA	One of you must be mistaken.

KAFKA	I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
GABRIELA	Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.

GABRIELA	Hello again.
KAFKA	I've never seen you here before.
GABRIELA	Have you looked?

KAFKA	Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
GABRIELA	Yes.

GABRIELA	I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
KAFKA	No.
GABRIELA	He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
KAFKA	I suspected that he -- well.
GABRIELA	What?
KAFKA	That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
GABRIELA	It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.

GABRIELA	What's funny?
KAFKA	This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
GABRIELA	As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.

KAFKA	How long were you and Eduard --
GABRIELA	Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.

KAFKA	No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
GABRIELA	Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
KAFKA	The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
GABRIELA	Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
KAFKA	He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
GABRIELA	And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
KAFKA	When I have no reason to doubt.
GABRIELA	The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
KAFKA	-- What could he have done to warrant that?

GABRIELA	Are you free tonight?
KAFKA	Tonight?
GABRIELA	There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
KAFKA	... All right.

GABRIELA	You almost married recently, didn't you?
KAFKA	Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
GABRIELA	Eduard wanted to marry me.
KAFKA	And you ...?
GABRIELA	I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.

KAFKA	-- I don't know the Musil district.
GABRIELA	You won't have any trouble finding it.

KAFKA	Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
GABRIELA	They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.

GABRIELA	I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
KAFKA	I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
GABRIELA	You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?

GABRIELA	The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
KAFKA	What of it?
GABRIELA	He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.

KAFKA	And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
GABRIELA	He was murdered.

GABRIELA	You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
KAFKA	I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
GABRIELA	When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
KAFKA	People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.

GABRIELA	You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
KAFKA	My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
GABRIELA	Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
KAFKA	At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.

GABRIELA	I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
KAFKA	Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
GABRIELA	Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
KAFKA	Why were you given notice?
GABRIELA	They're not obliged to tell.
KAFKA	It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
GABRIELA	Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
KAFKA	You don't believe that.
GABRIELA	I wouldn't put it past him.

GABRIELA	You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
KAFKA	Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
GABRIELA	It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.

KAFKA	That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
GABRIELA	Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
KAFKA	Burgel doesn't like anybody!
GABRIELA	He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
KAFKA	He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.

GABRIELA	Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
KAFKA	Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
GABRIELA	How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
KAFKA	I've heard of it happening.
GABRIELA	And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
KAFKA	Usually.

GABRIELA	Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
KAFKA	First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
GABRIELA	What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
KAFKA	Now Burgel's one of the authorities?

KAFKA	Gabriela! -- you did get away.
GABRIELA	I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
KAFKA	-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
GABRIELA	Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.

KAFKA	Gabriela ...?
GABRIELA	Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.

GABRIELA	Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
KAFKA	I -- I found your jailer.
GABRIELA	This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
KAFKA	They're dead now.  We can get help.
GABRIELA	I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
KAFKA	There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
GABRIELA	I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
KAFKA	I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
GABRIELA	Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.

GABRIELA	I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
KAFKA	No -- not this time.
GABRIELA	I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
KAFKA	-- Listen to me --
GABRIELA	I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.

INSPECTOR	Kafka -- is that your real name?
KAFKA	Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
INSPECTOR	When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
KAFKA	Wednesday.  We left the office together.
INSPECTOR	Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
KAFKA	No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
INSPECTOR	Your office is the Workmen's --
KAFKA	-- Accident and Compensation Association.
INSPECTOR	Where you've been employed for seven years.
KAFKA	Eight -- and seven months.
INSPECTOR	Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
KAFKA	Well -- other departments are, yes.
INSPECTOR	Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
KAFKA	Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
INSPECTOR	He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
KAFKA	I don't know.
INSPECTOR	Was he depressed?
KAFKA	No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
INSPECTOR	Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
KAFKA	No, I suppose not.
INSPECTOR	He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
KAFKA	Can I ask -- how you found me?
INSPECTOR	His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
KAFKA	I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
INSPECTOR	We know that.

KAFKA	He wasn't a lonely man, though.
INSPECTOR	What makes you think so?
KAFKA	... Just a perception.

KAFKA	Probably not.
INSPECTOR	Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
KAFKA	I'll bear that in mind.
INSPECTOR	-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.

KAFKA	But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
INSPECTOR	That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
KAFKA	If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?

KAFKA	You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
INSPECTOR	That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
KAFKA	She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.

KAFKA	Maybe it's true then what she said.
INSPECTOR	What did she say?
KAFKA	That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.

KAFKA	Do you?
OSKAR	We saw her naked once -- didn't we.

KAFKA	I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
OSKAR	You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.

OSKAR	-- I was just trying to finish some work!
KAFKA	You mean you've actually begun some?

KAFKA	What's the matter with you?
OSKAR	I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
KAFKA	-- You should meet my father.

KAFKA	For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
OSKAR	-- Just doing our job.
KAFKA	It's a farce.

OSKAR	Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
KAFKA	Close only by virtue of antithesis.

KAFKA	My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
OSKAR	It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.

KAFKA	... Why take me into your confidence?
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.

KAFKA	That's <u>mad</u>.
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Oh, yes, it's mad.

KAFKA	-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
KAFKA	Then why haven't I been --

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
KAFKA	Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST	The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.

KAFKA	... A piece of paper ...
MURNAU	A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?

MURNAU	Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
KAFKA	... A piece of paper ...
MURNAU	You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.

MURNAU	-- You seem amused.
KAFKA	It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.

MURNAU	-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
KAFKA	Accident and Compensation -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
MURNAU	I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
KAFKA	I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.

KAFKA	And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
MURNAU	Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.

MURNAU	May I ask where your two warders are?
KAFKA	Lying in the gutter where they belong.

KAFKA	The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
MURNAU	On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.

MURNAU	-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
KAFKA	What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
MURNAU	As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.

KEEPER	Raban -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
KAFKA	It usually is.
KEEPER	I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.

KEEPER	I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
KAFKA	Yes.  Isn't it there?

KEEPER	Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
KAFKA	He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department

KAFKA	What's the matter?
KEEPER	Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
KAFKA	It's gone out so quickly?
KEEPER	Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
KAFKA	-- You mean my Chief has it.

KEEPER	If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
KAFKA	Orlac is an account?
KEEPER	It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.

KAFKA	All these in the last year?
KEEPER	You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
KAFKA	I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
KEEPER	Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
KAFKA	This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
KEEPER	Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
KAFKA	Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
KEEPER	Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
KAFKA	What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
KEEPER	These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
KAFKA	What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
KEEPER	You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
KAFKA	Where do our records go to in the Castle?
KEEPER	We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
KAFKA	I could always apply there.
KEEPER	It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.

LUDWIG	Ludwig.
OSKAR	Oskar.

OSKAR	He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
LUDWIG	You look tired.
OSKAR	Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?

LUDWIG	Women are all you have on your mind!
OSKAR	She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.

LUDWIG	They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
OSKAR	We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
LUDWIG	It's not too bad working here.

OSKAR	It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
LUDWIG	And we're upset too.

LUDWIG	We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
OSKAR	-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?

OSKAR	But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
LUDWIG	My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.

LUDWIG	Oskar!
OSKAR	Ludwig?

LUDWIG	This is filed incorrectly!
OSKAR	Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!

LUDWIG	We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
OSKAR	They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
LUDWIG	I understand he was wounded in the lung.
OSKAR	It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
LUDWIG	What's to become of us now?

OSKAR	Then that's the place for us!
LUDWIG	Amerika for us!
OSKAR	Amerika!

GEORGE	Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
ANDY	Tank you veddy much.
GEORGE	So I understand you're from Lithuania?
ANDY	No.  Caspiar.

GEORGE	Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
ANDY	It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.

GEORGE	People love... comedians.
ANDY	I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.

GEORGE	You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
ANDY	I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.

GEORGE	Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
ANDY	The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
GEORGE	That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!

ANDY	Sitcom...?
GEORGE	And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
ANDY	I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
ANDY	George, I hate sitcoms.
GEORGE	HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!

ANDY	No.
GEORGE	No?  "No" to which part??
ANDY	No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.

GEORGE	Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
ANDY	I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
GEORGE	B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
ANDY	I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.

GEORGE	You have to do it.
ANDY	I refuse.
GEORGE	LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!

ANDY	Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
GEORGE	Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.

GEORGE	Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
ANDY	Those are my terms.
GEORGE	They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
ANDY	He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.

GEORGE	Andy?
ANDY	Hi George!
GEORGE	Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
ANDY	Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
GEORGE	That's alright.  Where...?

GEORGE	Andy!
ANDY	What's up?

GEORGE	Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
ANDY	The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
GEORGE	Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
ANDY	Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"

GEORGE	You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
ANDY	Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!

ANDY	I'm sorry, George...
GEORGE	You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!

GEORGE	When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
ANDY	But George, I like to push the boundaries...
GEORGE	And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!

ANDY	How long would they let me sleep?
GEORGE	I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?

ANDY	Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
GEORGE	Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
ANDY	Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!

GEORGE	I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
ANDY	Oh no!  Did he get hurt?

ANDY	Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
GEORGE	There'll be other shots.

GEORGE	You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
ANDY	But wasn't it funny?
GEORGE	Funny?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...

ANDY	George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
GEORGE	But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.

ANDY	That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
GEORGE	No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.

ANDY	They're having a laugh...
GEORGE	WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
ANDY	That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!

GEORGE	Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
ANDY	What, you don't think I can beat him?
GEORGE	He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.

ANDY	We were just trying to push the envelope --
GEORGE	You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.

ANDY	Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
GEORGE	Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.

ANDY	Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
GEORGE	Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.

ANDY	The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
GEORGE	Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.

ANDY	No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
GEORGE	That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
ANDY	I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.

GEORGE	What was that all about?
ANDY	It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.

GEORGE	You must take a little pleasure in it.
ANDY	Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.

GEORGE	Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
ANDY	Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.

GEORGE	So how can I help you...?
ANDY	I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
GEORGE	Do you wanna tour the clubs?
ANDY	No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!

ANDY	I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
GEORGE	So who's gonna pay for it?
ANDY	Tony Clifton.
GEORGE	You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
ANDY	Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!

ANDY	I can't move my arm.
GEORGE	You've got good days and bad days.

ANDY	My hair is coming out.
GEORGE	Yeah...

GEORGE	Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
ANDY	Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
GEORGE	Really?
ANDY	Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!

ANDY	So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
MANAGER	Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
ANDY	You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
MANAGER	Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...

ANDY	What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
MANAGER	Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
ANDY	I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
MANAGER	Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."

ANDY	Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
STANLEY	Andy!
ANDY	Oh!

ANDY	But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
STANLEY	You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
ANDY	B-but I have them.
STANLEY	No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!

STANLEY	B-but... we saw... your neck...
ANDY	Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.

STANLEY	B-but... we saw... your neck...
ANDY	Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.

STANLEY	Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
ANDY	But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!

MAYNARD	Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
ANDY	But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!

MAYNARD	Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
ANDY	But it's only for thirty seconds!

MAYNARD	Five.
ANDY	Twenty!
MAYNARD	Ten.
ANDY	Deal.

ANDY	Right...
MAYNARD	Okay, great!  So let's reset!

MAYNARD	Cue the commercial!
ANDY	These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...

MIMI	Excuse me -- ?
ANDY	Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.

MIMI	What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
ANDY	No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
MIMI	I don't wanna talk about it!

ANDY	What do you mean?
MIMI	I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
ANDY	I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???

ANDY	Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
LYNNE	Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.

ANDY	Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
LYNNE	Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.

ANDY	Hi...
LYNNE	Hi... am I late?
ANDY	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

ANDY	Popcorn?
LYNNE	No thanks.
ANDY	I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.

LYNNE	Andy, the theater's that way!
ANDY	Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."

LYNNE	Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
ANDY	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

ANDY	Hi...
LYNNE	Hi... am I late?
ANDY	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

ANDY	Popcorn?
LYNNE	No thanks.
ANDY	I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.

LYNNE	Andy, the theater's that way!
ANDY	Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."

LYNNE	Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
ANDY	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
LYNNE	You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.

ANDY	Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
LYNNE	I'm here, ain't I?

ANDY	Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
LYNNE	Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
ANDY	Yes.

LYNNE	Why Memphis?
ANDY	Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???

LYNNE	And all this will be for real?
ANDY	If you want...

ANDY	Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
LYNNE	No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!

LYNNE	Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
ANDY	I can shtop whenever I want...

LYNNE	Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
ANDY	I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!

ANDY	Go away.
LYNNE	It's me.
ANDY	Oh, it's open.

LYNNE	I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
ANDY	I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
LYNNE	Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
ANDY	You don't know the real me.
LYNNE	Andy... there is no real you.

LYNNE	Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
ANDY	They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
LYNNE	Have you told your family?
ANDY	No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.

LYNNE	How can you be so casual??!
ANDY	Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
LYNNE	You're NOT DYING!
ANDY	Okay.  You're probably right.

ANDY	I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
JACK BURNS	Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
ANDY	You're not listening to me --
JACK BURNS	Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
ANDY	But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!

JACK BURNS	Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
ANDY	I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
JACK BURNS	GET OFF!
ANDY	DON'T TOUCH ME!

ANDY	T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
LAWLER	You're a wimp.
ANDY	My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
LAWLER	Then your father's a wimp.
ANDY	And you're just poor white trash!

ANDY	T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
LAWLER	You're a wimp.
ANDY	My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
LAWLER	Then your father's a wimp.
ANDY	And you're just poor white trash!

ZMUDA	Hey Andy, good show.
ANDY	Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.

ANDY	I'm gonna quit.
ZMUDA	What?!?
ANDY	Each show is worse than the next.
ZMUDA	Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
ANDY	So?  What do they know?
ZMUDA	Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!

ANDY	Give me the book.
ZMUDA	No!  Andy, don't do it --
ANDY	They're asking for it.

ANDY	I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
ZMUDA	She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
ANDY	It's so dirty.
ZMUDA	Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.

ZMUDA	Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?
ANDY	Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!

ANDY	Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
ZMUDA	What is this, World War Two...?
ANDY	You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
ZMUDA	No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!

ZMUDA	... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi...
ANDY	It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
ZMUDA	It's working for Elvis.

ANDY	Sir, do you have a problem?
ZMUDA	Yeah, my problem is you're tired.

ANDY	I, I was asked to do this material - -
ZMUDA	Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
ANDY	Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
ZMUDA	Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!

ANDY	I was very original!
ZMUDA	Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???

ANDY	This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
ZMUDA	I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
ANDY	Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
ZMUDA	And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
ANDY	No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!

YOGI	Are you at peace with your family?
ANDY	Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
YOGI	Goals are important.
ANDY	I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
YOGI	We are all impressed.

YOGI	Excuse me, Andy...
ANDY	Yes, your Holiness?

YOGI	This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
ANDY	Why??  I... I attend every year.
YOGI	Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.

ANDY	Philosophically?
YOGI	The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.

ANDY	Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
YOGI	It is apparently not working.
ANDY	So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
YOGI	Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.

OLD DOCTOR	I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
ANDY	Are you sure?
OLD DOCTOR	Positive.
ANDY	But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
OLD DOCTOR	It's probably just a strained muscle.
ANDY	Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.

GEORGE	Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
BOOKER	Oh.

GEORGE	Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
BOOKER	Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.

GEORGE	Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
BOOKER	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
GEORGE	No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
BOOKER	I'll take my chances!!

GEORGE	Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
BOOKER	Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
GEORGE	Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
BOOKER	Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!

TONY CLIFTON	Burlesque?
ED	Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.

ED	We had a deal!!
TONY CLIFTON	I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
ED	Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
TONY CLIFTON	I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.

ED	Get off my stage!  You're fired!
TONY CLIFTON	I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!

TONY CLIFTON	Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?
GEORGE	Er, yes.  Speaking.
TONY CLIFTON	Speaking!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!

GEORGE	Can I help you with something?
TONY CLIFTON	Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
GEORGE	Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
GEORGE	Look... I don't know what your problem is...
TONY CLIFTON	Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!

ZMUDA	That was a really hot house!
GEORGE	So your name's not Gorsky.
ZMUDA	Don't believe everything you hear.

GEORGE	I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
ZMUDA	Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
GEORGE	Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...

GEORGE	So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
ZMUDA	Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
GEORGE	But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?

GEORGE	Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
ZMUDA	Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!

GEORGE	Why...?  Andy, why...?
ZMUDA	I used to think you were original.

ZMUDA	Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
GEORGE	FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.

GEORGE	If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
ZMUDA	What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!

GEORGE	It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
ZMUDA	Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.

STANLEY	Is he in his room?
JANICE	Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.

JANICE	I saw Michael!
STANLEY	Where?
JANICE	There!

JANICE	Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
STANLEY	He said he's coming back!

JANICE	What's in Memphis?
STANLEY	Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.

JANICE	Why is he saying these things?!
STANLEY	They're gonna lynch him!

JANICE	JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
STANLEY	Why isn't he MOVING??

SAD SACK	Sure...
TONY CLIFTON	What's your name?
SAD SACK	Bob.
TONY CLIFTON	Bob?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
SAD SACK	Bob Gorsky.
TONY CLIFTON	Gorsky?  What is that, Polish?
SAD SACK	Yes.

TONY CLIFTON	Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
SAD SACK	It's my name.
TONY CLIFTON	SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!

SAD SACK	A -- a tourist.
TONY CLIFTON	See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!

AVA	Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
GREGORY	No, I'm going.
AVA	The Shawfish?
GREGORY	Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
AVA	Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
GREGORY	I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.

BOBO	Are you ready?
MR. JOHNNY	Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
BOBO	Very good, Mr. Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY	We will both have the Salad Ticino.
BOBO	Uh-huh
MR. JOHNNY	And I'll have the special fish.

MR. JOHNNY	No, I want to see the dessert cart.
BOBO	Very good.

BOBO	I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY	I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.

ROSE	Who's dead?
COSMO	Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
ROSE	Again? Johnny Cammareri.

COSMO	I don't like him.
ROSE	You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?

COSMO	I have no money!
ROSE	You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.

COSMO	I won't pay for nothing.
ROSE	He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.

COSMO	I don't wanna talk about it.
ROSE	Well, what do you wanna talk about!
COSMO	Rita. Pass the wine.
ROSE	Why you drinking so much?

ROSE	Where you been?
COSMO	I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.

ROSE	Cosmo?
COSMO	What?
ROSE	I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
COSMO	Thank you, Rose.
ROSE	You're welcome.
COSMO	I'm going to bed now.

ROSE	Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
COSMO	His brother.

ROSE	Have I been a good wife?
COSMO	Yes.
ROSE	I want you to stop seeing her.

COSMO	Okay.
ROSE	And go to confession.
COSMO	A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
ROSE	Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.

COSMO	I don't wanna talk about it.
RAYMOND	Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
COSMO	I don't wanna talk about it.

COSMO	Rose, pass the wine.
RAYMOND	I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
COSMO	You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
RAYMOND	No. You were there.

COSMO	Hi.  Hi.
MR. JOHNNY	Hello, Mr. Castorini.

MR. JOHNNY	I have my eyes open.
COSMO	You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
MR. JOHNNY	I don't know what you mean.
COSMO	I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
MR. JOHNNY	You haven't said anything.
COSMO	And that's how much I'm saying.

LORETTA	Where's Ma?
COSMO	Bed.
LORETTA	You're not sleepy?
COSMO	I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
LORETTA	Pop, I got news.

LORETTA	Here.  Ti amo. 
COSMO	Ti amo.
LORETTA	You look tired.
COSMO	What's your news?
LORETTA	I'm getting married.
COSMO	Again?
LORETTA	Yeah.
COSMO	You did this once it didn't work out.
LORETTA	The guy died.
COSMO	What killed him?
LORETTA	He got hit by a bus.
COSMO	No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
LORETTA	Johnny Cammareri.
COSMO	Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
LORETTA	He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
COSMO	More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
LORETTA	In a month.
COSMO	I won't come.
LORETTA	You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
COSMO	I didn't give you away the first time.
LORETTA	And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
COSMO	Maybe.
LORETTA	I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
COSMO	He did?
LORETTA	Yeah.
COSMO	That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?

LORETTA	Here.
COSMO	It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
LORETTA	It's temporary.
COSMO	Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
LORETTA	So you'll come to the wedding, right?
COSMO	Let's go tell your Mother.

LORETTA	Mona?
COSMO	What'd you do to your hair?
LORETTA	I got it done.
COSMO	What are you doing here?
LORETTA	What are you doing here?
COSMO	Who is this man? You're engaged!
LORETTA	You're married.
COSMO	You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
LORETTA	You're my father.
COSMO	Alright. I didn't see you here.
LORETTA	I don't know whether I saw you or not.

COSMO	And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
MONA	And what did they say?
COSMO	The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
MONA	You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
COSMO	I brought you something.

MONA	Oh, Cosmo!
COSMO	They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.

MONA	You haven't once said you like my dress.
COSMO	I like your dress.  It's very bright.

MONA	Why you looking around so much?
COSMO	I don't know. I got a feeling.
MONA	I'm wearing your bracelet.

FELIX	It's wrong to just let them go.
OLD MAN	Good morning, Lucy.

OLD MAN	What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
FELIX	You have too many dogs.

FELIX	I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
OLD MAN	You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.

OLD MAN	At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
FELIX	Hurry up.

FELIX	We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
OLD MAN	I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.

OLD MAN	Yes!
FELIX	Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.

RONNY	Yeah, this is Ronny.
LORETTA	I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.

RONNY	Why didn't he call himself?
LORETTA	He's in Palermo.
RONNY	What's wrong can never be made right. 
LORETTA	Let me come and talk to you.

RONNY	Have you come from my brother?
LORETTA	Yes.
RONNY	Why?
LORETTA	I'm going to marry him.
RONNY	You are going to marry my brother?
LORETTA	Yes. Do you want...
RONNY	I have no life.
LORETTA	Excuse me.
RONNY	I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
LORETTA	I don't understand.

RONNY	Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
LORETTA	Maybe I should come back another time.
RONNY	No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!

RONNY	It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
LORETTA	That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
RONNY	That's it.
LORETTA	But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
RONNY	I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?

RONNY	Loretta. What's that smell?
LORETTA	I'm making you a steak.
RONNY	You don't have to help me.
LORETTA	I know that. I do what I want.
RONNY	I like it well done.
LORETTA	You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.

RONNY	This is good. Uhh...
LORETTA	Loretta.
RONNY	Where'd Johnny find you?
LORETTA	He knew my husband who died.
RONNY	How'd he die?
LORETTA	Bus hit him.
RONNY	Fast.
LORETTA	Instantaneous.
RONNY	When you get engaged?
LORETTA	Yesterday.

RONNY	Why?
LORETTA	Why what?
RONNY	I don't know.
LORETTA	So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
RONNY	No.
LORETTA	Stupid.
RONNY	When your husband get hit by the bus?
LORETTA	Seven years ago.
RONNY	How many men since then?
LORETTA	Just Johnny.
RONNY	Stupid yourself.
LORETTA	No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
RONNY	I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
LORETTA	What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
RONNY	Why you talking to me?
LORETTA	You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?

RONNY	She was right to leave me.
LORETTA	You think so?
RONNY	Yes.
LORETTA	You really are stupid, you know that.

RONNY	You don't know nothing about it.
LORETTA	I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
RONNY	I'm a wolf?
LORETTA	The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
RONNY	What are you doing!
LORETTA	I'm telling you your life!
RONNY	Stop it!
LORETTA	No!
RONNY	Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
LORETTA	Because I have no Luck!
RONNY	He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
LORETTA	I am looking where I should to become a bride!
RONNY	A bride without a head!
LORETTA	A wolf without a foot!

RONNY	Son of a bitch!
LORETTA	Where are you taking me?
RONNY	To the bed.
LORETTA	Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.

RONNY	I can't believe what is happening.
LORETTA	Me neither.
RONNY	I was dead.
LORETTA	I was dead, too.

RONNY	Your blood.
LORETTA	All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
RONNY	Loretta.
LORETTA	I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
RONNY	I've got you.
LORETTA	Get all of me. Take everything.
RONNY	What about Johnny?
LORETTA	You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
RONNY	Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.

RONNY	What?
LORETTA	That light.
RONNY	I don't know. I think it's the moon.

RONNY	It's so bright.
LORETTA	I've never seen a moon like that.
RONNY	It makes you look like an angel.

LORETTA	Oh my God.
RONNY	What?

LORETTA	What? What have we done?
RONNY	Take it easy.
LORETTA	This time I was trying to do everything right.
RONNY	Don't just become excited.
LORETTA	I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
RONNY	You're trying to make me feel guilty.
LORETTA	I'm marrying your brother!
RONNY	All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
LORETTA	You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
RONNY	She didn't like me.
LORETTA	You don't get along with anybody!
RONNY	What did you do?
LORETTA	What did I do?
RONNY	You ruined my life.
LORETTA	That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
RONNY	Oh no I didn't!

LORETTA	Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
RONNY	What?
LORETTA	Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
RONNY	I can't do that!
LORETTA	Why not?
RONNY	I'm in love with you!

LORETTA	Snap out of it!
RONNY	I can't!
LORETTA	Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
RONNY	I'll come to the wedding.
LORETTA	I'm telling you you can't.
RONNY	But he wants me to come!
LORETTA	But that's cause he don't know!
RONNY	Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
LORETTA	What?
RONNY	That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
LORETTA	What are you talking about?
RONNY	I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
LORETTA	Alright.
RONNY	Alright. Meet me at the Met.
LORETTA	Alright. Where's the Met?

RONNY	Hi.
LORETTA	Hi.
RONNY	You look beautiful. Your hair...
LORETTA	I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
RONNY	Thank you.

LORETTA	Who painted that?
RONNY	Marc Chagall. A Russian.
LORETTA	Kinda gaudy.
RONNY	He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.

RONNY	Thank you!
LORETTA	For what?
RONNY	I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.

LORETTA	So. Where are we sitting?
RONNY	Come on.

LORETTA	They get some turnout for this stuff.
RONNY	It's the best thing there is.
LORETTA	I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.

LORETTA	That was just so... awful!
RONNY	Awful?
LORETTA	Beautiful. Sad. She died!
RONNY	Yeah.
LORETTA	I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...

LORETTA	No thanks.
RONNY	I think that's it.

RONNY	What do you want to do now?
LORETTA	I wanna go home.

LORETTA	It's really cold.
RONNY	Yeah. It smells like snow.

RONNY	What's the matter?
LORETTA	How can you ask me that?
RONNY	You're making me feel guilty again.
LORETTA	You are guilty. I'm guilty.
RONNY	Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
LORETTA	I know what I know.
RONNY	And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
LORETTA	He didn't come!
RONNY	I'm here!
LORETTA	You're late!
RONNY	We're here.

LORETTA	This is your place.
RONNY	That's right.
LORETTA	This is where we're going!
RONNY	Yeah.
LORETTA	The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.

LORETTA	I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
RONNY	Yeah.
LORETTA	I'm really afraid.
RONNY	Why?
LORETTA	I'm afraid of who I am.
RONNY	I was.
LORETTA	And you're not now?

LORETTA	Why not?
RONNY	I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
LORETTA	Let me go home.
RONNY	No.
LORETTA	Let me go home.
RONNY	No.
LORETTA	I'm freezing to death.
RONNY	Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!

LORETTA	Ronny!
RONNY	Is Johnny here?
LORETTA	He's coming.
RONNY	Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 

LORETTA	You've gotta get outta here.
RONNY	No. I'm gonna wait.
LORETTA	Ronny, please...

RONNY	No, I'll tell him.
LORETTA	No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?

LORETTA	What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
RONNY	Loretta, what are you talking about?
LORETTA	I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!

RONNY	Loretta?
LORETTA	What!
RONNY	Will you marry me.

RONNY	Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
LORETTA	Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!

LORETTA	I got things to do.
RITA	Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
LORETTA	Right.

RITA	What's the matter? You look crazy.
LORETTA	I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.

LORETTA	Bye, Aunt Rita.
RITA	Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
LORETTA	Yeah, I'll be in.

RITA	Hi Loretta.
LORETTA	Hi.

RITA	Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
LORETTA	You? No.

RITA	It's Johnny Cammareri.
LORETTA	Johnny.

LORETTA	You don't want the fish.
MR. JOHNNY	No?
LORETTA	It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
MR. JOHNNY	Maybe you're right.
LORETTA	Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.

MR. JOHNNY	A man who can't control his woman is funny.
LORETTA	She was too young for him.

LORETTA	You never have dessert.
MR. JOHNNY	Never is a long time.

LORETTA	What's the matter?
MR. JOHNNY	My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.

MR. JOHNNY	Have Something.
LORETTA	I shouldn't.
MR. JOHNNY	Will you marry me?
LORETTA	What?
MR. JOHNNY	Will you marry me?
LORETTA	Bobo, take the cart away.

LORETTA	Are you proposing marriage to me?
MR. JOHNNY	Yes?
LORETTA	You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
MR. JOHNNY	What do you mean?
LORETTA	We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
MR. JOHNNY	I don't understand.
LORETTA	Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
MR. JOHNNY	On the floor?
LORETTA	Yes, on the floor.
MR. JOHNNY	This is a good suit.
LORETTA	I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
MR. JOHNNY	Alright.

MR. JOHNNY	I like this ring.
LORETTA	You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.

LORETTA	What time is it?
MR. JOHNNY	Seven-thirty.
LORETTA	So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.

LORETTA	What about the wedding?
MR. JOHNNY	My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
LORETTA	How near is she to death?
MR. JOHNNY	A week. Two weeks. No more.
LORETTA	Then let's set the date.
LORETTA	How about a month from today?
MR. JOHNNY	Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
LORETTA	Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
MR. JOHNNY	Alright. A month. In a month.
LORETTA	A month from today?
MR. JOHNNY	Yeah.
LORETTA	I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.

MR. JOHNNY	I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
LORETTA	You've made me very happy, Johnny.

MR. JOHNNY	There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
LORETTA	Who is he?
MR. JOHNNY	He's my younger brother.
LORETTA	You have a brother?
MR. JOHNNY	We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
LORETTA	Sure.

MR. JOHNNY	Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
LORETTA	How was your plane ride?
MR. JOHNNY	The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.

LORETTA	Have you told her we're getting married?
MR. JOHNNY	Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.

LORETTA	I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
MR. JOHNNY	We should talk alone.
LORETTA	I can't. I need my family around me now.
MR. JOHNNY	Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.

LORETTA	Johnny, I have something to tell you.
MR. JOHNNY	I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
LORETTA	I have no secrets from my family.
MR. JOHNNY	Loretta, I can't marry you.
LORETTA	WHAT?
MR. JOHNNY	If I marry you my mother will die.

LORETTA	And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
MR. JOHNNY	I must ask for that back.

MR. JOHNNY	In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
LORETTA	In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.

MR. JOHNNY	What?
LORETTA	Where's the ring?

LORETTA	No.
ROSE	Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
LORETTA	Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
ROSE	And who's gonna pay for that?
LORETTA	Pop.

ROSE	Will you live here?
LORETTA	No.
ROSE	Why not?
LORETTA	Pop don't like Johnny.

ROSE	So we'll sell the house.
LORETTA	I got married before, you didn't sell.

ROSE	Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
LORETTA	I'm thirty-seven years old.
ROSE	What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
LORETTA	Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
ROSE	And we'll sell the house.
LORETTA	I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
ROSE	No. He don't.

ROSE	How's the mother?
LORETTA	She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
ROSE	Did he tell her?
LORETTA	Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?

LORETTA	Hi.
ROSE	Where you been?
LORETTA	I don't wanna talk about it.
ROSE	Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
LORETTA	Thanks. What's the matter with you?
ROSE	Cosmo's cheating on me.
LORETTA	What! How do you know?
ROSE	A wife knows.
LORETTA	Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.

ROSE	What the hell happened to you?
LORETTA	Well. I don't really know where to start.
ROSE	Your hair's different.
LORETTA	Everything's different.
ROSE	Are you drunk?
LORETTA	No. Are you drunk?
ROSE	No. But I have a hangover.
LORETTA	Where's pop?
ROSE	Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.

LORETTA	What? He's in Sicily!
ROSE	No more he's not.
LORETTA	He's with his dying mother!
ROSE	She recovered.
LORETTA	WHAT!! She was dying!
ROSE	It was a miracle.
LORETTA	A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
ROSE	I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.

ROSE	Do you love him, Loretta?
LORETTA	Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
ROSE	Oh God, that's too bad.

LORETTA	Hi.
RAYMOND	Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
LORETTA	What's the matter with him?

LORETTA	What about the moon?
RAYMOND	Did you see it?
LORETTA	No.
RAYMOND	Oh.
LORETTA	Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
RAYMOND	You gotta date?

RAYMOND	Hi, Loretta.
LORETTA	Hi. Why ain't you at the store?

RAYMOND	We just come from the bank.
LORETTA	The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!

LORETTA	Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
PRIEST	What sins have you to confess?
LORETTA	Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
PRIEST	Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
LORETTA	I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
PRIEST	That's a pretty big sin.
LORETTA	I know.
PRIEST	You should think about this.
LORETTA	I know.
PRIEST	Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
LORETTA	Alright.
PRIEST	I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

OLD MAN	Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
LUCY	I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
OLD MAN	My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.

LUCY	Don't fight.
OLD MAN	My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
LUCY	He should pay.
OLD MAN	I don't know.
LUCY	He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
OLD MAN	Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.

LUCY	Don't fight.
OLD MAN	If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.

LUCY	Don't make yourself sick.
OLD MAN	Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
LUCY	Talk to him.
OLD MAN	I will. But I must find the right moment.
LUCY	Did you see the moon last night?

ROSE	Moving in?
MR. JOHNNY	I came right from the airport.
ROSE	Come on in.

MR. JOHNNY	Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
ROSE	She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.

ROSE	So.
MR. JOHNNY	Where is she?
ROSE	Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
MR. JOHNNY	It's late.
ROSE	Yes.

MR. JOHNNY	Maybe I should go?
ROSE	What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
MR. JOHNNY	That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
ROSE	A miracle. Well, that's news.
MR. JOHNNY	My mother's recovered.
ROSE	You're kidding?
MR. JOHNNY	The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
ROSE	That's incredible.
MR. JOHNNY	Yes.

MR. JOHNNY	Who was that?
ROSE	That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
MR. JOHNNY	Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
ROSE	But why would a man need more than one woman?
MR. JOHNNY	I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.

ROSE	That's it! That's the reason!
MR. JOHNNY	I don't know.
ROSE	No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.

ROSE	He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
MR. JOHNNY	You don't know where Loretta is?
ROSE	No idea.
MR. JOHNNY	Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
ROSE	Okay, I'll tell her.

MR. JOHNNY	Loretta...
RONNY	Johnny...
MR. JOHNNY	Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
RONNY	Good.
MR. JOHNNY	Have you come to make peace with me?
RONNY	Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
MR. JOHNNY	Of course I want to.

RONNY	I'm sure she did.
MR. JOHNNY	It was a miracle!

MR. JOHNNY	Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
RONNY	You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
MR. JOHNNY	And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!

SHY WAITER	Yes?
PERRY	Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
SHY WAITER	But absolutely!

PERRY	Can I get another one of these?
SHY WAITER	Definitely!

PERRY	May I presume to ask you a question?
SHY WAITER	Sure!
PERRY	Do you have a girlfriend?
SHY WAITER	I am alone in the world.

SHY WAITER	When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
PERRY	What happened?
SHY WAITER	She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.

PERRY	Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
SHY WAITER	Absolutely!

PERRY	Thanks, comrade.
SHY WAITER	It's nothing!

PERRY	I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
ROSE	I'm not disturbed. By you.
PERRY	My lady friend has a personality disorder.
ROSE	She was just too young for you.

PERRY	Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
ROSE	None of your business.

PERRY	Sorry. That was rude.
ROSE	Will you join me for dinner?
PERRY	Are you sure?

PERRY	Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
ROSE	What do you do?
PERRY	I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
ROSE	That woman was a student of yours?
PERRY	Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
ROSE	There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
PERRY	Yes.
ROSE	Don't shit where you eat.
PERRY	I'll remember that. What do you do?
ROSE	I'm a housewife.
PERRY	Then why are you eating alone?
ROSE	I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
PERRY	Go ahead.
ROSE	Why do men chase women?
PERRY	Nerves.
ROSE	I think it's because they fear death.
PERRY	Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
PERRY	I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
ROSE	What you don't know about women is a lot.

PERRY	May I walk with you a ways?
ROSE	Sure.

PERRY	You knew that man?
ROSE	Yes.

PERRY	Temperature's dropping.
ROSE	Yes.
PERRY	I guess you can't invite me in?
ROSE	No.
PERRY	People home.
ROSE	No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
PERRY	I'm a little cold.
ROSE	You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
PERRY	We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
ROSE	I'm too old for you.
PERRY	I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
ROSE	Good night.

PERRY	Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
ROSE	Sure.

PERRY	I'm freezing
ROSE	Good night.

ROSE'S VOICE	That's my house.
PERRY'S VOICE	You mean the whole house?
ROSE'S VOICE	Yes.
PERRY'S VOICE	My God, it's a mansion!
ROSE'S VOICE	It's a house.
PERRY'S VOICE	I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
ROSE'S VOICE	He's a plumber.
PERRY'S VOICE	Well. That explains it.

RAYMOND	Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
RITA	Marriage is happy news.

RAYMOND	Rita. Rita.
RITA	What? What?
RAYMOND	Look.
RITA	Oh.
RAYMOND	It's Cosmo's moon.
RITA	What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
RAYMOND	I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
RITA	Is who down there?
RAYMOND	Cosmo.
RITA	What would he be doing down there?
RAYMOND	I don't know.
RITA	You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.

RAYMOND	I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
RITA	You were a tiger last night.
RAYMOND	And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
RITA	Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
RAYMOND	So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
RITA	Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
RAYMOND	I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!

RITA	You got me.
RAYMOND	You see that moon last night?

RITA	What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
RAYMOND	Oh. Right.

RITA	She's got it.
RAYMOND	I knew she had it.

RITA	We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
RAYMOND	WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!

VADA	Arthur!!
ARTHUR	Vada!!
VADA	I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
ARTHUR	Good for you baby.
VADA	Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
ARTHUR	I like to buy off all the railroads.

VADA	Wanna play?
ARTHUR	No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.

BOY#2	Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
VADA	Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.

VADA	Hey, you didn't pay me!
BOY#2	How do I know you were gonna show us one?
VADA	You're such a baby.
BOY#2	All right, here.

BOY#2	Of what??
VADA	Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.

HARRY	Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
DANNY	Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....

HARRY	Danny?
DANNY	WHAT?
HARRY	Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
DANNY	This guy bonking you?

DANNY	Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
HARRY	It's her home! It's where she lives!!
DANNY	Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.

DANNY	What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
SHELLY	Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
DANNY	You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.

SHELLY	I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
DANNY	Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
SHELLY	Keep your voice down!
DANNY	What?
SHELLY	The boss is watching us...
DANNY	I'm impressed.
SHELLY	God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
DANNY	Yeah, all right...

SHELLY	This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
DANNY	Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.

SHELLY	Ex...ex, ex...
DANNY	My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.

DR WELTY	You are perfectly healthy.
VADA	That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
DR WELTY	Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
VADA	Yes.
DR WELTY	Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!

VADA	Can't you see it?
DR WELTY	No.
VADA	It's there.
DR WELTY	Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.

VADA	Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
DR WELTY	Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
VADA	I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
DR WELTY	Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.

VADA	It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
DR WELTY	What Hurts Vada?
VADA	The bee stings! I can't breathe!

SHELLY	It's still available I hope?
HARRY	I think it's still available.
SHELLY	I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
HARRY	Uhh, Miss devoto...
SHELLY	I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
HARRY	Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
SHELLY	They're dead?
HARRY	Yes they are.
SHELLY	Stiffs??
HARRY	Deceased.
SHELLY	The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;

SHELLY	Excuse me, what about the job?
HARRY	Pardon?
SHELLY	I need the job.
HARRY	Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
SHELLY	Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
HARRY	You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
SHELLY	Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
HARRY	Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
SHELLY	I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.

HARRY	Uh huh?
SHELLY	Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
HARRY	Yeah.

SHELLY	You don't like it?
HARRY	This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
SHELLY	I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
HARRY	She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
SHELLY	I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
HARRY	That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.

SHELLY	Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
HARRY	What do you mean??
SHELLY	Well the other night at dinner...
HARRY	Oh that, she just likes to play.
SHELLY	I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
HARRY	She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
SHELLY	Harry, I really think she.....
HARRY	She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?

HARRY	Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
SHELLY	Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
HARRY	Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
SHELLY	I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
HARRY	After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
SHELLY	I'm sure she will.

SHELLY	Hi.
HARRY	Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
SHELLY	Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
HARRY	Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
SHELLY	Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
HARRY	I wrote that.
SHELLY	No kidding?

SHELLY	Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
HARRY	I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
SHELLY	In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
HARRY	It's no big deal.
SHELLY	You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
HARRY	I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
SHELLY	I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.

HARRY	I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
SHELLY	Okay.

SHELLY	Does it make it easier to win?
HARRY	No. Just, more activity.

SHELLY	I just had a terrible thought Harry.
HARRY	What's that?
SHELLY	I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
HARRY	Why d'you think these seats were empty.

SHELLY	Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
HARRY	Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
SHELLY	Kinda like men.
HARRY	Oh, how do you mean?
SHELLY	You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.

SHELLY	I had a good time tonight.
HARRY	I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

SHELLY	Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
HARRY	Okay, sure.

SHELLY	Home sweet home.
HARRY	It's nice.
SHELLY	I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
HARRY	Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
SHELLY	You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.

HARRY	Yeah.
SHELLY	Are you mad at me?
HARRY	No, why?
SHELLY	I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
HARRY	Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
SHELLY	What happened to her?
HARRY	Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
SHELLY	Did she ever see Vada?
HARRY	I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....

SHELLY	Dance with me?
HARRY	Here?
SHELLY	This is where we are.
HARRY	Is there enough room?

HARRY	I haven't danced in.....
SHELLY	In ages, I know, me neither.

HARRY	Rock?
SHELLY	See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
HARRY	At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.

SHELLY	What are you wearing?
HARRY	Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.

SHELLY	Do you want to?
HARRY	Want to what?
SHELLY	Kiss me.
HARRY	Yes.
SHELLY	Good.

HARRY	I ahh, better go.
SHELLY	It's only eight o'clock.
HARRY	Goodnight Shelly.
SHELLY	Goodnight.

HARRY	I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
SHELLY	Goodnight.

HARRY	I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
SHELLY	Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
HARRY	Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
SHELLY	It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
HARRY	I'm looking forward to that.

SHELLY	You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
HARRY	Really?

SHELLY	How's it going chef?
HARRY	Okay.

SHELLY	Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
HARRY	I'll second that.

HARRY	Shelly?
SHELLY	Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....

SHELLY	Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
HARRY	Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.

SHELLY	Well, you were pretty great!
HARRY	Is it really your camper?

SHELLY	Can we see it from the back yard?
HARRY	You can get the general idea...

HARRY	Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
SHELLY	Pointing upwards Look...
HARRY	Did you ahh, love him?
SHELLY	I would never marry anybody I didn't love.

HARRY	Watch you don't knock out a fish.
SHELLY	Perfect.
HARRY	I don't know which ball's mine.

SHELLY	Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
HARRY	I know that, but what do you want from me?
SHELLY	Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
HARRY	Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
SHELLY	I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.

VADA	I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
HARRY	O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.

VADA	Ahem.
HARRY	Vada, just put 'em on the stool.

VADA	Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
HARRY	Ya, that rack holds six ties.

HARRY	Vada, we're trying to work here.
VADA	Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
HARRY	Hand me the canula.

HARRY	VADA!
VADA	Dad?
HARRY	I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 

VADA	Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
HARRY	They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
VADA	Is it for a child?

HARRY	Of course not.
VADA	Then who's it for?

VADA	Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
HARRY	That's a lot of money for a little girl.
VADA	It's for school, for summer writing class.
HARRY	Any more soda left?

VADA	Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
HARRY	Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.

VADA	Dad?
HARRY	I love this guy! 
VADA	Dad??
HARRY	What?
VADA	The money?
HARRY	Ahh, maybe next summer.

HARRY	Goodnight Vada.
VADA	Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
HARRY	Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
VADA	You never cared before.
HARRY	Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
VADA	Why?
HARRY	She likes to play bingo.
VADA	Can I go too?
HARRY	Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.

HARRY	HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
VADA	Sorry.

VADA	Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
HARRY	Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.

VADA	Are they ready yet?
HARRY	No, sweetie, not yet.

VADA	When?
HARRY	Soon honey, soon.

VADA	When??
HARRY	In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.

VADA	Yes..
HARRY	Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.

VADA	I like the freak show.
HARRY	I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.

HARRY	We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
VADA	Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.

HARRY	I fall asleep at the wheel.
VADA	I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!

HARRY	Hi Vada.
VADA	Hi.
HARRY	What are you doing.
VADA	Feeding my fish.
HARRY	Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
VADA	Yes.
HARRY	He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.

HARRY	Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
VADA	I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?

VADA	Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
HARRY	No sweetheart, you can't.
VADA	Why not?
HARRY	He was allergic to bees.
VADA	He's okay isn't he?
HARRY	There were just too many of 'em.

HARRY	He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
VADA	Get away, get away!!

VADA	Did I kill my mother?
HARRY	What??
VADA	The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
HARRY	No, no.

VADA	I found this.
HARRY	I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
VADA	In the garage.
HARRY	Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
VADA	What was my mama like?
HARRY	She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
VADA	Really?
HARRY	Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
VADA	Do you miss her?
HARRY	Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
VADA	I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
HARRY	That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.

PHIL	Well well well, what's going on in here?
HARRY	Nothing, I'm dressing.
PHIL	Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?

PHIL	Oh yes, oh that's great.
HARRY	I'm very nervous.
PHIL	Why?
HARRY	The last date I had was twenty years ago.
PHIL	That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
HARRY	Oh come on.
PHIL	Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
HARRY	Are you sure about all this?
PHIL	Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
HARRY	Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
PHIL	Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
HARRY	No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
PHIL	Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.

PHIL	Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
HARRY	That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
PHIL	No, no no....
HARRY	Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!

SHELLY	Hi.
JUDY	Hi, is Vada home?
SHELLY	Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
JUDY	Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
SHELLY	Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
JUDY	Will you tell her I came by?
SHELLY	Sure.
JUDY	Thank you. Bye.
SHELLY	Bye.

MR. BIXLER	Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
VADA	It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
MR. BIXLER	Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
VADA	Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
MR. BIXLER	No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?

VADA	Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
MR. BIXLER	Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
VADA	This is one big house for one single person.
MR. BIXLER	Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
VADA	How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
MR. BIXLER	Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
VADA	How much does it cost?
MR. BIXLER	Thirty five dollars.
VADA	What do you get for that?
MR. BIXLER	Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
VADA	No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
MR. BIXLER	It's summer! You're kids! Go play!

VADA	I paid the money.
MR. BIXLER	For this class?
VADA	Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
MR. BIXLER	Vada, this is an adult writing class.

MR. BIXLER	Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
VADA	I wrote a poem too.
MR. BIXLER	Please.
VADA	Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.

MR. BIXLER	Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
VADA	Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
MR. BIXLER	Come here, sit down over here.

VADA	Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
MR. BIXLER	Oh, Vada...
VADA	I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
MR. BIXLER	Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
VADA	No he wouldn't, I can't go home.

VADA	Who's that?
MR. BIXLER	That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.

VADA	No....
MR. BIXLER	I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
VADA	Get away from me!

VADA	I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
MR. BIXLER	We'd love to hear it.
VADA	Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.

NURSE RANDALL	So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
THOMAS J	Cool, can I get one for Vada?
NURSE RANDALL	Oh yes, yes.

THOMAS J	Cause she's dying.
NURSE RANDALL	Do you think she is?
THOMAS J	No.
NURSE RANDALL	Why do you think she says that?
THOMAS J	Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
NURSE RANDALL	You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.

VADA	He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
PHIL	He likes her.
VADA	Does he love her?
PHIL	Probably.
VADA	Do you like her?
PHIL	Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
VADA	Why?
PHIL	After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
VADA	Really?
PHIL	Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
VADA	My Dad was funny?
PHIL	Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.

VADA	Is that your camper?
SHELLY	Yes it is.
VADA	That's really cool.

VADA	She's shy.
SHELLY	Oh.

SHELLY	Who's winning?
VADA	I am.

SHELLY	You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
VADA	I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.

VADA	He's allergic to everything.
SHELLY	Chocolate?

SHELLY	Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
VADA	It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.

SHELLY	Maybe black means you're happy?
VADA	I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?

VADA	Shut your big fat mouth!
SHELLY	I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
VADA	He won't give it to me.
SHELLY	Well you don't know that. Ask him.

SHELLY	Vada? VADA?? What happened??
VADA	My ball, I lost my ball.
SHELLY	Come on sweetie.

SHELLY	Hi.
VADA	Can we look around in your camper?
SHELLY	Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.

VADA	Big Ringo fan.
SHELLY	Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
VADA	I would.
SHELLY	Thomas?

VADA	Did you read ALL these books?
SHELLY	Uh huh.
VADA	What are they about?
SHELLY	Mostly love, and romance.

VADA	Are you married?
SHELLY	No, I'm divorced.
VADA	Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
SHELLY	Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.

SHELLY	Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
VADA	Can I use your bathroom first?
SHELLY	Sure.
VADA	You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
SHELLY	Okay.

VADA	Are you going out somewhere?
SHELLY	No.
VADA	So how come you're putting lipstick on?
SHELLY	A girl's always gotta look her best.
VADA	I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
SHELLY	Have you ever tried any?
VADA	No.
SHELLY	Come here, sit down.

VADA	Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
SHELLY	Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
VADA	The boys at school don't think I am.
SHELLY	They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
VADA	Do you like putting makeup on people?
SHELLY	Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.

VADA	Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
SHELLY	Aarrggh.

SHELLY	Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
VADA	Hi.

VADA	Hey Shelly, like seafood?
SHELLY	Uh huh, why?
VADA	See food!

VADA	I like my name.
SHELLY	This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
VADA	Are you here to take Shelly back?

SHELLY	I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
VADA	Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
SHELLY	Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.

VADA	I won, I won!!!
SHELLY	Oh great!!

SHELLY	Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
VADA	NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.

VADA	NO!
SHELLY	Yes!!

VADA	Daddy??!?!?!
SHELLY	Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
VADA	Where's Daddy?
SHELLY	Well he just left, what's wrong?
VADA	I'm hemorrhaging.
SHELLY	What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
VADA	I don't want, I don't need your help....

SHELLY	How old are you?
VADA	I'm eleven and a half.
SHELLY	It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.

VADA	My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
SHELLY	It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
VADA	I think it should be outlawed.
SHELLY	Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.

SHELLY	It's okay sweetheart.
VADA	I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
SHELLY	I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
VADA	I will I promise.
SHELLY	Okay, get in to bed.

SHELLY	Goodnight.
VADA	Goodnight.

SHELLY	Thomas J?
THOMAS J	I'm allergic to it.
SHELLY	To chocolate?

THOMAS J	Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
SHELLY	Uh huh.
THOMAS J	I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
SHELLY	Liverpool?

THOMAS J	Eeeeuuuww, gross.
SHELLY	They're just fun to read.

SHELLY	Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
THOMAS J	What are you saving for?
SHELLY	Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.

SHELLY	Oh great!
THOMAS J	Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.

VADA	I knew he wouldn't come.
THOMAS J	I can't, I have to go home.

THOMAS J	Hey look at this, no feet!
VADA	Oh wow, a real evil canieval.

THOMAS J	At what?
VADA	That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
THOMAS J	I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
VADA	Hi Mr. Bixler!

VADA	No, I'm going home.
THOMAS J	Why? It's not dinner time yet.
VADA	Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.

THOMAS J	It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
VADA	It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.

THOMAS J	She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
VADA	It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
THOMAS J	She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.

VADA	Maybe they had a big breakfast.
THOMAS J	I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
VADA	Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
THOMAS J	Oh no!  UUH.
VADA	Hurry!
THOMAS J	I'm trying.
VADA	Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
THOMAS J	I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?

THOMAS J	Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
VADA	Hey, we can become blood brothers.
THOMAS J	Naah, I don't wanna.
VADA	You could pick that scab on your arm.
THOMAS J	It's a mosquito bite.
VADA	It'll bleed.
THOMAS J	If I do it, can we go?
VADA	Uh huh.
THOMAS J	Okay, OW!

THOMAS J	Your lip bleeding?
VADA	No.
THOMAS J	What's wrong with your eyes?
VADA	A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
THOMAS J	Where's your bike?
VADA	Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

THOMAS J	Hey look at this!
VADA	That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
THOMAS J	No, I don't wanna.
VADA	Come on, it's fun.

VADA	Hmmmm, interesting.
THOMAS J	What?
VADA	You have no personality.
THOMAS J	Hey, where does it say that?
VADA	Never mind.

THOMAS J	Is that your Dad?
VADA	Yes.
THOMAS J	Who's that with your Dad?
VADA	It's my mother.
THOMAS J	Do you remember her?
VADA	No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
THOMAS J	What do you think it's like?
VADA	What?
THOMAS J	Heaven.
VADA	I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
THOMAS J	But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
VADA	It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
THOMAS J	That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.

VADA	Here.
THOMAS J	Don't DO that!!
VADA	Sorry.
THOMAS J	What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
VADA	Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
THOMAS J	I told you i'll get in trouble.
VADA	Pacifist!
THOMAS J	I am not.
VADA	Bed wetter!
THOMAS J	I stopped that!

THOMAS J	They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
VADA	We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
THOMAS J	Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
VADA	Duck!

THOMAS J	Can we go yet?
VADA	Go???
THOMAS J	You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.

THOMAS J	Hey Vada, guess what we got?
VADA	What?

THOMAS J	THIS!! 
VADA	HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!

THOMAS J	Woah!!
VADA	What?
THOMAS J	Pointing There's a beehive right there!
VADA	So?
THOMAS J	Stand back.

VADA	Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
THOMAS J	You're right, let's knock it down.
VADA	What do you want it for anyway?
THOMAS J	For their meat.

THOMAS J	Got it!
VADA	My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!

THOMAS J	Run faster they're after us!!
VADA	I am running faster!!
THOMAS J	Hurry!!!

VADA	Jump in the water!!
THOMAS J	But I have my clothes on!
VADA	Do it!

THOMAS J	Hi Vada.
VADA	Hi, wanna ride bikes?
THOMAS J	Sure.

THOMAS J	Come on, let's go.
VADA	Bye Mrs. Sennett.
THOMAS J	Bye Ma.

VADA	California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
THOMAS J	I wanna live with them too.
VADA	No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
THOMAS J	Really?

VADA	Get up!?
THOMAS J	I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.

THOMAS J	Why are you running away?
VADA	My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
THOMAS J	Wow, was it a decoder ring?
VADA	You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
THOMAS J	They're getting married?

THOMAS J	So now you'll have a mother.
VADA	I don't like her.
THOMAS J	I do, she's real funny.
VADA	He likes her better than me.
THOMAS J	I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
VADA	Then go home, baby.
THOMAS J	I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
VADA	Leave then, some friend you are.
THOMAS J	You can come to my house for dinner?
VADA	No, I'm hiding out.
THOMAS J	Okay, seeya.

VADA	Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
THOMAS J	Hi Vada, can you come out?
VADA	I dunno..
THOMAS J	Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?

THOMAS J	Well when you get older, you just have to.
VADA	I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
THOMAS J	You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
VADA	It is not.
THOMAS J	Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
VADA	Not true.
VADA	Have you ever kissed anyone?
THOMAS J	Like they do on TV?
VADA	Uh huh.
THOMAS J	No.
VADA	Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
THOMAS J	But, I don't know how.
VADA	Here, practice on your arm like this.

THOMAS J	Like this?
VADA	Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
VADA	Close your eyes.
THOMAS J	But then I won't be able to see anything.

VADA	Just do it.
THOMAS J	Okay, okay.
VADA	Okay on the count of three.

VADA	Say something it's too quiet.
THOMAS J	Umm, Ummmmm
VADA	Just, hurry.

THOMAS J	You better not either.
VADA	Well, let's spit on it.
THOMAS J	Okay.

VADA	Seeya tomorrow.
THOMAS J	Okay, seeya.  Vada?
VADA	What?
THOMAS J	Would you think of me?
VADA	For what?
THOMAS J	Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

MICHAEL	Yeah, it's in the contract.
DIGGER	Well, then, I'll take it up with her.

DIGGER	... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
MICHAEL	I should look different.
DIGGER	You should look like you dressed yourself.

MICHAEL	And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
DIGGER	Something like that.

MICHAEL	Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
DIGGER	Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.

DIGGER	What?
MICHAEL	I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.

MICHAEL	Stay, huh?
DIGGER	I honestly wish I could...
MICHAEL	I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.

MICHAEL	You don't miss much.
DIGGER	Part of being a New Yorker.

DIGGER	Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
JULIANNE	If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.

JULIANNE	Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
DIGGER	I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

JULIANNE	See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
DIGGER	Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
JULIANNE	Plus some guys whose food I don't like.

DIGGER	Needs salt.
JULIANNE	Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
DIGGER	... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.

JULIANNE	Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
DIGGER	... weeks.

JULIANNE	No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
DIGGER	The wandering sportswriter.

JULIANNE	Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
DIGGER	Kindred spirits.
JULIANNE	No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.

JULIANNE	He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
DIGGER	He's still in love with you.

DIGGER	Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
JULIANNE	Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...

DIGGER	I've lost interest.
JULIANNE	He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...

DIGGER	Blood oath.
JULIANNE	He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"

JULIANNE	You think...
DIGGER	Desperate.  To talk.

JULIANNE	He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
DIGGER	Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?

JULIANNE	He can't do that to me!
DIGGER	We're about to find out.

JULIANNE	We'll never be the same.
DIGGER	I have a suggestion...
JULIANNE	I'll have to kill myself before I call him.

JULIANNE	You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
DIGGER	No, he's ruining yours.
JULIANNE	Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
DIGGER	You have a real philosophy of life.
JULIANNE	It's called the Law of Love, asshole.

JULIANNE	He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
DIGGER	I can see why.
JULIANNE	She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!

DIGGER	Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
JULIANNE	Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
DIGGER	When I'm talking to children.

JULIANNE	You flew all the way h...
DIGGER	I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
JULIANNE	You're butting in.

JULIANNE	What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
DIGGER	You like her.
JULIANNE	If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.

JULIANNE	I was devastated.
DIGGER	Go figure you.
JULIANNE	Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...

JULIANNE	There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
DIGGER	You've been working on this, huh?
JULIANNE	... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.

JULIANNE	This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
DIGGER	And you believe that.
JULIANNE	Sure.

JULIANNE	He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
DIGGER	It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
JULIANNE	I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
DIGGER	Impressive.
JULIANNE	I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
DIGGER	The man you love.
JULIANNE	Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
DIGGER	Someday she'll thank you.
JULIANNE	Let's not get carried away.

DIGGER	Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
JULIANNE	I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!

DIGGER	Zit cream?
JULIANNE	I wish.
DIGGER	Neosporin?
JULIANNE	Try less appropriate.
DIGGER	Ben Gay.
JULIANNE	That was Thursday.

DIGGER	Elmer's Glue?
JULIANNE	DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!

DIGGER	I give.
JULIANNE	I can't even say it.

JULIANNE	How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
DIGGER	What do you suggest?

DIGGER	I suppose it's too late to start over.
JULIANNE	It's too late to start over.

DIGGER	Two words.
JULIANNE	Major.  Dish.
DIGGER	Manicure...

JULIANNE	You're going to say it, aren't you?
DIGGER	Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
JULIANNE	I'm taking my next book to Viking.
DIGGER	Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
JULIANNE	I'm moving this book to Viking.
DIGGER	Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
JULIANNE	Needing.
DIGGER	To belong to someone.

DIGGER	Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
JULIANNE	And what will he do?

DIGGER	Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
JULIANNE	Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...

JULIANNE	I did what I came to do.
DIGGER	Good girl.

JULIANNE	I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
DIGGER	Oh, you're more than okay.

KIMMY	All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
JULIANNE	Well, we're...
KIMMY	I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.

KIMMY	My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
JULIANNE	You need a few dollars.

JULIANNE	Excuse me?
KIMMY	I can be quick.  I can even be funny.

KIMMY	But I can't be dry.
JULIANNE	Can you watch the road?
KIMMY	See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.

KIMMY	This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
JULIANNE	... you want a menage on your wedding night.

KIMMY	You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
JULIANNE	Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.

KIMMY	The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
JULIANNE	Which was the disqualifying factor?
KIMMY	The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.

JULIANNE	I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
KIMMY	Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.

JULIANNE	What else did he tell you...
KIMMY	... you hate weddings, you never go.

JULIANNE	That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
KIMMY	He said that, too.

JULIANNE	Don't you have to be somewh...
KIMMY	... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.

JULIANNE	... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
KIMMY	What? Because I'm a little understand...
JULIANNE	... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.

KIMMY	I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
JULIANNE	So your honeymoon is exactly where?

KIMMY	It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
JULIANNE	... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...

JULIANNE	Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
KIMMY	... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?

JULIANNE	How about...
KIMMY	... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...

KIMMY	He sucks soup through his front teeth.
JULIANNE	A trademark move, don't touch it.
KIMMY	But he sure can kiss.
JULIANNE	It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
KIMMY	After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.

KIMMY	And loving him means loving all of this.
JULIANNE	Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
KIMMY	So it's sweet of you to be protective...
JULIANNE	Let me rephrase that...
KIMMY	But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
JULIANNE	Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
KIMMY	... except one.

KIMMY	You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
JULIANNE	Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
KIMMY	I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
JULIANNE	No.
KIMMY	And the answer was so simple.
JULIANNE	I was gonna predict that.
KIMMY	You win.

KIMMY	You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
JULIANNE	I've missed a step.
KIMMY	He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.

JULIANNE	Jesus, we're trapped!
KIMMY	Ju...
JULIANNE	No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!

KIMMY	It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
JULIANNE	... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
KIMMY	Stop, we're embarrassing h...
JULIANNE	... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...

KIMMY	About Michael's job.
JULIANNE	Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
KIMMY	I just think you're wrong, is all.
JULIANNE	Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.

KIMMY	I mean, he loves his job.
JULIANNE	Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...

KIMMY	But he always says...
JULIANNE	... whatever is manly and independent.

KIMMY	For the twins? What in the world is th...
JULIANNE	Gold nose hair clippers.

KIMMY	Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
JULIANNE	Hello.

KIMMY	So... one almost has to...
JULIANNE	Exactly.
KIMMY	Exactly what?
JULIANNE	What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.

KIMMY	He'll see right through it.
JULIANNE	Only.  If he wants to.

JULIANNE	In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
KIMMY	He won't get mad, huh?

JULIANNE	Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
KIMMY	I just don't want to freak him out.

JULIANNE	Uh, Kimmy...?
KIMMY	We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.

KIMMY	Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
JULIANNE	They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?

JULIANNE	Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
KIMMY	This must be... very, very, hard on him.
JULIANNE	What with the psychosis and all, yeah.

JULIANNE	When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
KIMMY	Don't you see...
JULIANNE	If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
KIMMY	... that this is all my fault?

JULIANNE	Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
KIMMY	I love him.

JULIANNE	In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
KIMMY	WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
JULIANNE	Have you ever heard of. Irony?

JULIANNE	I never want to go through this again.
KIMMY	That's entirely understandable.

MANDY	Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.
JULIANNE	... unless he has a hump.

JULIANNE	Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
MANDY	... look good on Kimberly.
JULIANNE	Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.

JULIANNE	I saw the show.
MANDY	... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.

MANDY	Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
JULIANNE	It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
MANDY	Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.

JULIANNE	Ex-cuse me?
MANDY	I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
JULIANNE	You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?

WALTER	If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
JULIANNE	I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
WALTER	Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
JULIANNE	Nice meeting you, too, Walt.

WALTER	They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
JULIANNE	I think you're making a mistake, sir.

JULIANNE	Is anybody watching?
WALTER	I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.

WALTER	Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
JULIANNE	Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?

JULIANNE	It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
WALTER	I know Ben.

JULIANNE	I think he's been fired.
WALTER	It doesn't say th...
JULIANNE	He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.

WALTER	And you think he's kept this to himself.
JULIANNE	He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.

WALTER	Maybe.  I should call Ben.
JULIANNE	Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.

WALTER	I thought Michael was picking me up.
JULIANNE	I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.

WALTER	I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
JULIANNE	Nobody has.  So far.

WALTER	Well, you're a little early...
JULIANNE	I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?

MICHAEL	I've been calling for days!
JULIANNE	Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...

JULIANNE	Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
MICHAEL	You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!

MICHAEL	And she's all wrong for me!
JULIANNE	Well, somet...
MICHAEL	I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.

JULIANNE	Well, sure.
MICHAEL	But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
JULIANNE	You've met her parents.

JULIANNE	Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
MICHAEL	Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.

MICHAEL	Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
JULIANNE	... Thomas, yeh.

JULIANNE	Well, maybe we should talk ab...
MICHAEL	I need you.

MICHAEL	Please come, please.
JULIANNE	W...
MICHAEL	I can't wait for you to meet her!

JULIANNE	What's the sec...
MICHAEL	Mirrors.

JULIANNE	Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
MICHAEL	Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??

JULIANNE	I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
MICHAEL	... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.

MICHAEL	Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
JULIANNE	Such as.
MICHAEL	She's too genuine.
JULIANNE	Hate that.
MICHAEL	How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
JULIANNE	What's next?

MICHAEL	No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
JULIANNE	Endearingly absent-minded.
MICHAEL	My very point.  Here's another one...

MICHAEL	Every day.  She makes the bed.
JULIANNE	Quite the little eccentric.
MICHAEL	At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!

JULIANNE	Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
MICHAEL	She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
JULIANNE	Waiter! Check, please!
MICHAEL	She finds him "personable."
JULIANNE	Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?

JULIANNE	Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
MICHAEL	First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.

JULIANNE	Where was that, Florence, huh?
MICHAEL	Firenze.

JULIANNE	The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
MICHAEL	Till the gas ran out.

JULIANNE	Should I whistle down a cab?
MICHAEL	Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?

JULIANNE	Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
MICHAEL	What, leaving school...
JULIANNE	... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...

JULIANNE	I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
MICHAEL	She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.

JULIANNE	I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
MICHAEL	I got the point.

JULIANNE	Still.  All's fair in love and w...
MICHAEL	That would be a girl.  I don't even know.

MICHAEL	You're not eating.
JULIANNE	I never eat when I'm serene.
MICHAEL	You never eat when you're despondent.
JULIANNE	I switched that around when you weren't looking.

MICHAEL	Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
JULIANNE	Boy, those were the days.

MICHAEL	It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
JULIANNE	You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.

MICHAEL	Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
JULIANNE	Never can tell.

MICHAEL	Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
JULIANNE	Michael!!

MICHAEL	No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
JULIANNE	Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
MICHAEL	Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!

MICHAEL	You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
JULIANNE	Like I said, dazzling.

MICHAEL	Big weddings are so strange.
JULIANNE	You keep saying that.

MICHAEL	Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
JULIANNE	Well, you've got the rest of your lives.

JULIANNE	You miss her, huh?
MICHAEL	No.  I've got you.

MICHAEL	Don't you throw up on boat?
JULIANNE	If you like.

MICHAEL	I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
JULIANNE	Have you.

JULIANNE	Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
MICHAEL	It's more than that.

MICHAEL	You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
JULIANNE	You've been the man in mine.

MICHAEL	And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
JULIANNE	Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
MICHAEL	Except for that.

MICHAEL	I can hardly wait for your wedding.
JULIANNE	Me either.

JULIANNE	I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
MICHAEL	I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.

MICHAEL	Dance card filled?
JULIANNE	I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.

MICHAEL	Where did we first hear th...
JULIANNE	The night we met.

MICHAEL	So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
JULIANNE	We danced to it.  Just like this.

MICHAEL	Takes me back.
JULIANNE	Well.

JULIANNE	No accents today.
MICHAEL	Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.

MICHAEL	Will she like it?
JULIANNE	Yes.

MICHAEL	It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
JULIANNE	ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...

JULIANNE	I'm up against a deadline.
MICHAEL	Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
JULIANNE	That's my point!!

MICHAEL	I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
JULIANNE	It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.

JULIANNE	We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
MICHAEL	Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...

MICHAEL	Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
JULIANNE	You're right.  Easy come, easy go.

MICHAEL	This thing means that much to y...
JULIANNE	It means a lot.

MICHAEL	The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
JULIANNE	... maybe it's congratulations.

JULIANNE	Michael? What ha...
MICHAEL	Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...

MICHAEL	Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
JULIANNE	Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down...
MICHAEL	I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
JULIANNE	Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl.

JULIANNE	What happened?
MICHAEL	It's over.

MICHAEL	She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
JULIANNE	A bad combination.

JULIANNE	Michael...
MICHAEL	No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
JULIANNE	Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
MICHAEL	The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.

JULIANNE	Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
MICHAEL	I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?

MICHAEL	Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.
JULIANNE	If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...

JULIANNE	I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
MICHAEL	Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
JULIANNE	But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
MICHAEL	She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
JULIANNE	Get married, apparently.

MICHAEL	This is her family and her fault.
JULIANNE	And your point?
MICHAEL	Well.  How come she didn't...
JULIANNE	BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.

MICHAEL	I asked you...
JULIANNE	She admits it's her fault.

JULIANNE	Does that make it right...
MICHAEL	Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.

MICHAEL	Thank God you were here.
JULIANNE	Oh, yeah.
MICHAEL	I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
JULIANNE	Well, it happens.

JULIANNE	... your one chance for true happiness?
MICHAEL	... yeah, that.
JULIANNE	You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.

JULIANNE	The Big Hurt, huh?
MICHAEL	Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.

MICHAEL	What's up?
JULIANNE	Shhh.

MICHAEL	Jules, what's wrong...
JULIANNE	This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.

MICHAEL	Uh.  I saw that moving...
JULIANNE	DON'T SPEAK!

MICHAEL	You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
JULIANNE	... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
MICHAEL	ARE YOU CRAZY?

MICHAEL	I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
JULIANNE	I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...

JULIANNE	Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
MICHAEL	Lower.
JULIANNE	Lower.
MICHAEL	The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.

JULIANNE	I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
MICHAEL	I came here, looking for her.

JULIANNE	Why would she come here...
MICHAEL	This is where I proposed.

MICHAEL	I never forgot that.
JULIANNE	It's two weeks.
MICHAEL	Almost three.
JULIANNE	That is so romantic.

JULIANNE	You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
JULIANNE	Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
MICHAEL	I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
JULIANNE	That's little egotistical.

JULIANNE	Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
MICHAEL	If you find her...

MICHAEL	The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
JULIANNE	... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.

KIMMY	Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
MICHAEL	I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
KIMMY	The most important thing. Is being together.

MICHAEL	Because I could come...
KIMMY	To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?

MICHAEL	It's not just a gag, huh?
KIMMY	No, it's, uh... a real big favor.

MICHAEL	He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
KIMMY	... and public relations is a big problem area for him.

KIMMY	He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
MICHAEL	Like family, huh?

KIMMY	It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
MICHAEL	To him.

KIMMY	And to m...
MICHAEL	... and you knew about this.

KIMMY	All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
MICHAEL	Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!

MICHAEL	I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
KIMMY	What is that sup...
MICHAEL	And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.

MICHAEL	What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
KIMMY	Well, if that's the way you f...
MICHAEL	Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?

MICHAEL	Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
KIMMY	MICHAEL!!

MANDY	Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
SAMMY	... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.

SAMMY	Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
SAMMY	Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
MANDY	... I'm partial to the tight end.
SAMMY	This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...

SAMMY	And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
MANDY	With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.

SAMMY	Maybe it's happy there.
MANDY	Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
SAMMY	He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
MANDY	An so it is.

MANDY	Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
SAMMY	You're much more his type.

ANNA	Hi.
BELLA	Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...

ANNA	I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
BELLA	Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.

BELLA	What do you think of the guinea fowl?
ANNA	I'm a vegetarian.
BELLA	Oh God.

ANNA	Lovely to meet you.
BELLA	And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.

ANNA	Wait a minute.  What about me?
MAX	I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
ANNA	Well... a shot at it.

ANNA	That was such a great evening.
MAX	I'm delighted.

ANNA	And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
MAX	Now you're lying.
ANNA	You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.

MAX	No!
ANNA	Night, night, Honey.

JAMES	We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.
ANNA	We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
JAMES	Oh, stop showing off.

JAMES	God, that's an enormous arse.
ANNA	I'm not listening.
JAMES	No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
ANNA	I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.

ANNA	So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
JAMES	'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
ANNA	And then I... right.
JAMES	Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
ANNA	Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.

BERNIE	So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
ANNA	I'm an actress.
BERNIE	Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
ANNA	Well, they can be.
BERNIE	I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
ANNA	Films mainly.
BERNIE	Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
ANNA	Fifteen million dollars.
BERNIE	Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?

ANNA	No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
WILLIAM	Fine.

WILLIAM	That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
ANNA	Really?
WILLIAM	Yes.  This one though is... very good.

WILLIAM	I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
ANNA	Thanks.  I'll think about it.

WILLIAM	Sorry about that...
ANNA	No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
WILLIAM	Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.

ANNA	Oh Jesus.
WILLIAM	Here, let me help.

WILLIAM	Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
ANNA	No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
WILLIAM	I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.

ANNA	Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
WILLIAM	Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.

WILLIAM	Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
ANNA	No thanks.
WILLIAM	Coffee?
ANNA	No.
WILLIAM	Orange juice -- probably not.

WILLIAM	Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
ANNA	Really, no.
WILLIAM	Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
ANNA	No.
WILLIAM	Do you always say 'no' to everything?

ANNA	No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
WILLIAM	You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.

ANNA	Thank you.
WILLIAM	Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.

WILLIAM	Oh hi.  Forget something?
ANNA	I forgot my bag.
WILLIAM	Oh right.

WILLIAM	Here we go.
ANNA	Thanks.  Well...

WILLIAM	I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
ANNA	Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.

ANNA	Probably best not tell anyone about this.
WILLIAM	Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
ANNA	Bye.

WILLIAM	Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
ANNA	Hi.

WILLIAM	Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
ANNA	You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
WILLIAM	No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
ANNA	Oh -- Okay.
WILLIAM	Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
ANNA	Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
WILLIAM	Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.

WILLIAM	Hi.
ANNA	Hello.
WILLIAM	I brought these, but clearly...

WILLIAM	Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
ANNA	No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.

WILLIAM	Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
ANNA	Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
WILLIAM	Obviously.  Very difficult.

WILLIAM	I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
ANNA	No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
WILLIAM	Absolutely fine about it.

WILLIAM	I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
ANNA	And what happens next in the dream?

WILLIAM	Are you busy tonight?
ANNA	Yes.

ANNA	Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
WILLIAM	Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.

ANNA	Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
WILLIAM	Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
ANNA	Okay -- fine.
WILLIAM	But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
ANNA	No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
WILLIAM	You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
ANNA	If that's all right.
WILLIAM	I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
ANNA	Okay.
WILLIAM	Okay.

WILLIAM	You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
ANNA	Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...

ANNA	Floppy, huh?
WILLIAM	It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
ANNA	Why is she in a wheelchair?
WILLIAM	It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
ANNA	And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
WILLIAM	You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.

ANNA	Too complicated.
WILLIAM	That's fine.
ANNA	Busy tomorrow?
WILLIAM	I thought you were leaving.
ANNA	I was.

WILLIAM	Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
ANNA	Let's go in.
WILLIAM	Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
ANNA	You abide by rules like that?
WILLIAM	Ahm...

WILLIAM	Whoopsidaisies.
ANNA	What did you say?
WILLIAM	Nothing.
ANNA	Yes, you did.
WILLIAM	No, I didn't.
ANNA	You said 'whoopsidaisies.'

WILLIAM	I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
ANNA	There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
WILLIAM	Exactly.  Here we go again.

WILLIAM	It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
ANNA	Step aside.

ANNA	So who left who?
WILLIAM	She left me.
ANNA	Why?
WILLIAM	She saw through me.
ANNA	Uh-oh.  That's not good.

WILLIAM	I'm sorry.
ANNA	No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.

ANNA	I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
WILLIAM	No, you were brilliant
ANNA	I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
WILLIAM	I don't know, I'm afraid.
ANNA	I don't know either.

ANNA	Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
WILLIAM	There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
ANNA	There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?

WILLIAM	To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
ANNA	You've got to go.
WILLIAM	Why?
ANNA	Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
WILLIAM	Your boyfriend?

WILLIAM	-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
ANNA	I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
WILLIAM	I think goodbye is traditional.

ANNA	Hi.  Can I come in?
WILLIAM	Come in.

ANNA	I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
WILLIAM	This is the place.
ANNA	Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.

ANNA	These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
WILLIAM	Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
ANNA	A bath would be great.

ANNA	I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
WILLIAM	No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
ANNA	I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
WILLIAM	Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
ANNA	I have thought about you.
WILLIAM	Oh no no -- no.

ANNA	Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
WILLIAM	I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
ANNA	Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
WILLIAM	Would you like me to take you through your lines?
ANNA	Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
WILLIAM	Hand it over.  Basic plot?
ANNA	I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
WILLIAM	Well done you.

WILLIAM	'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
ANNA	'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
WILLIAM	'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
ANNA	'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
WILLIAM	Eleven.
ANNA	Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
WILLIAM	Cartwright.
ANNA	'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
WILLIAM	'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
ANNA	My son's name is Johnny?
WILLIAM	Yup.
ANNA	Well, get a message through to him too.
WILLIAM	Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
ANNA	What do you think?
WILLIAM	Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
ANNA	You think I should do Henry James instead?
WILLIAM	I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
ANNA	Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
WILLIAM	And I think the book is the poorer for it.

WILLIAM	You like Chagall?
ANNA	I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
WILLIAM	With a goat playing a violin.
ANNA	Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.

ANNA	You've got big feet.
WILLIAM	Yes.  Always have had.
ANNA	You know what they say about men with big feet?
WILLIAM	No.  What's that?
ANNA	Big feet -- large shoes.

ANNA	The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
WILLIAM	You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
ANNA	Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
WILLIAM	You have a stunt bottom?
ANNA	I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
WILLIAM	Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
ANNA	Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
WILLIAM	It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
ANNA	Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
WILLIAM	The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
ANNA	Both.

ANNA	Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
WILLIAM	Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
ANNA	Right.

WILLIAM	Oh please sod off.
ANNA	Okay.
WILLIAM	No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.

WILLIAM	Wow.
ANNA	What?

WILLIAM	It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
ANNA	You and every person in this country.
WILLIAM	Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
ANNA	What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
WILLIAM	Well...
ANNA	No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
WILLIAM	More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
ANNA	But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
WILLIAM	Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...

ANNA	Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
WILLIAM	Who was Gilda?
ANNA	Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
WILLIAM	You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
ANNA	Oh.

ANNA	Can I stay a bit longer?
WILLIAM	Stay forever.
ANNA	Damn, I forgot the jam.

ANNA	What?
WILLIAM	Don't ask.

ANNA	Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
WILLIAM	Undressed like this, yes.
ANNA	Jesus.

WILLIAM	How are you doing?
ANNA	How do you think I'm doing?
WILLIAM	I don't know what happened.
ANNA	I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.

WILLIAM	That's not true.
ANNA	Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.

ANNA	This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
WILLIAM	You do?

ANNA	As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
WILLIAM	I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
ANNA	You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
WILLIAM	That's spectacularly unfair.
ANNA	Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.

WILLIAM	Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
ANNA	I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.

ANNA	And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
WILLIAM	That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.

ANNA	You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
WILLIAM	I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
ANNA	Excuse me?
WILLIAM	Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
ANNA	You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.

ANNA	This is certainly... ah...
WILLIAM	I only found out you were here yesterday.
ANNA	I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...

ANNA	It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
WILLIAM	Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
ANNA	But... wait... there are things to say.
WILLIAM	Okay.
ANNA	Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.

ANNA	Hi.
WILLIAM	Hello.
ANNA	You disappeared.
WILLIAM	Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
ANNA	Well... how have you been?
WILLIAM	Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
ANNA	Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...

ANNA	I thought I'd give it to you.
WILLIAM	Thank you.  Shall I...
ANNA	No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
WILLIAM	Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
ANNA	I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
WILLIAM	What's the thing?

WILLIAM	You were saying...
ANNA	Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.

WILLIAM	But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
ANNA	You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?

WILLIAM	Sorry about that.
ANNA	That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.

WILLIAM	... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
ANNA	... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
WILLIAM	The truth is...

WILLIAM	... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
ANNA	I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
WILLIAM	I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
ANNA	Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.

ANNA	I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
WILLIAM	And what would you say...

ANNA	Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
WILLIAM	That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.

ANNA	Yes...
JEFF	Who is it?

ANNA	Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
JEFF	I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?

JEFF	Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
ANNA	Nice surprise.

JEFF	Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
ANNA	I haven't decided.
JEFF	Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."

THIEF	Excuse me.
ANNA	Yes.
THIEF	Can I have your autograph?
ANNA	What's your name?
THIEF	Rufus.

THIEF	What does it say?
ANNA	Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
THIEF	Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
ANNA	Tempting but... no, thank you.

MARTIN	Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
ANNA	Is that right?
MARTIN	Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
ANNA	I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
MARTIN	Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
ANNA	Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'

MAX	He's bringing a girl?
BELLA	Miracles do happen.
MAX	Does the girl have a name?
BELLA	He wouldn't say.
MAX	Christ, what is going on in there?

BELLA	That's right.
MAX	And this is William.

BELLA	Where are you going?
MAX	Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
BELLA	Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...

BELLA	Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
BERNIE	Anna Scott?
BELLA	Yes.
BERNIE	The movie star?
BELLA	Yup.
BERNIE	Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.

BERNIE	No.  Not true...
BELLA	C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.

BELLA	I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
BERNIE	... get fired.
BELLA	No!
BERNIE	Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.

BELLA	Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
WILLIAM	He's cooking guinea fowl?
BELLA	Don't even ask.

WILLIAM	Bella -- this is Anna.
BELLA	Right. 

BELLA	Still loves you though.
WILLIAM	In a depressingly asexual way.
BELLA	I never fancied you much actually...

BELLA	I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
WILLIAM	Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
BELLA	Do you want to stay?
WILLIAM	Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.

BELLA	Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
WILLIAM	Tony -- what do you think?

BELLA	This painting isn't the original, is it?
WILLIAM	Yes, I think that one may be.

WILLIAM	Bernie.
BERNIE	Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.

BERNIE	But she said she wanted to go out with you?
WILLIAM	Yes -- sort of...
BERNIE	That's nice.
WILLIAM	What?
BERNIE	Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
WILLIAM	It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.

BERNIE	Bloody hell, this is fun.
WILLIAM	Is Miss Scott staying here?

MAX	Hello, Bernie.
BERNIE	I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.

MAX	Bernie -- this is Anna.
BERNIE	Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.

MAX	Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
BERNIE	Shame!
MAX	I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.

MAX	If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
BERNIE	And we intend to use them!
MAX	Where's Bella?

WILLIAM	Is this your first film?
GIRL	No -- it's my 22nd.
WILLIAM	Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
GIRL	Working with Leonardo.
WILLIAM	Da Vinci?
GIRL	Di Caprio.
WILLIAM	Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?

HONEY	By the way -- it's you.
SPIKE	Me?
HONEY	Yes.  What do you think?
SPIKE	Well, yes.  Groovy.

SPIKE	I was called and I came.  What's up?
HONEY	William has just turned down Anna Scott.
SPIKE	You daft prick!

SPIKE	What happened?
HONEY	It was good.

HONEY	Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
WILLIAM	Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.

HONEY	Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
WILLIAM	Blimey.  What's that?
HONEY	The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
WILLIAM	Well, thanks, that's great.
HONEY	It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.

WILLIAM	What do you think?  Good move?
HONEY	Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.

WILLIAM	Ahm... room service.
JEFF	How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
WILLIAM	Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
JEFF	Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
WILLIAM	I'll see what I can do.
JEFF	Still, not sparkling.
WILLIAM	Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
JEFF	Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
WILLIAM	No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
JEFF	And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
WILLIAM	Right.

WILLIAM	Ah -- no.  It's fine.
JEFF	What's your name?
WILLIAM	Ahm... Bernie.

WILLIAM	I agree.
KAREN	I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.

WILLIAM	'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
KAREN	Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.

KAREN	If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
WILLIAM	The others?
KAREN	Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'

KAREN	Mr. Thacker?
WILLIAM	Yes?
KAREN	Have you got a moment?

KAREN	Are you a fan of Henry James?
WILLIAM	This is Henry James film?

MALE LEAD	Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
WILLIAM	Ah... yes, enormously.
MALE LEAD	Well, fire away.
WILLIAM	Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
MALE LEAD	I did.
WILLIAM	Any bit in particular?
MALE LEAD	Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.

WILLIAM	Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
MARTIN	Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
WILLIAM	Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.

MARTIN	Cappuccino as ordered.
WILLIAM	Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
MARTIN	Who?  Someone famous?

MARTIN	Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
WILLIAM	Topol.
MARTIN	That's right -- Topol.
WILLIAM	But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
MARTIN	No, well... he was quite a long way away.
WILLIAM	So it could have been neither of them?
MARTIN	I suppose so.
WILLIAM	Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
MARTIN	Not classic, no.

WILLIAM	Right -- want another one?
MARTIN	Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.

WILLIAM	Martin -- your customer.
MARTIN	Can I help you?

MARTIN	I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
WILLIAM	Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
MARTIN	But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
WILLIAM	Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?

MARTIN	Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
WILLIAM	Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
MARTIN	I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
WILLIAM	Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?

WILLIAM	Max.  This is Anna.
MAX	Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.

MAX	You haven't slept with her, have you?
WILLIAM	That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
MAX	'No comment' means 'yes.'
WILLIAM	No, it doesn't.
MAX	Do you ever masturbate?
WILLIAM	Definitely no comment.
MAX	You see -- it means 'yes.'

WILLIAM	So I get the brownie?
MAX	I think you do, yes.

MAX	You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
WILLIAM	No -- did you?

WILLIAM	Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
MAX	Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
WILLIAM	Buggered?
MAX	Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
WILLIAM	Really?

MAX	Well?
WILLIAM	She's perfect, perfect.

WILLIAM	I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
MAX	That's not fair.
WILLIAM	No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.

WILLIAM	Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
MAX	Is it someone we know?

MAX	Any more announcements?
WILLIAM	Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
MAX	There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
WILLIAM	But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.

MAX	So -- you've laid the ghost.
WILLIAM	I believe I have.
MAX	Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
WILLIAM	No, don't think I do.
MAX	Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.

WILLIAM	Oh God no.
MAX	So not over her, in fact.

MAX	Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
WILLIAM	Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.

WILLIAM	Hello.
RITZ MAN	May I help you, sir?
WILLIAM	Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
RITZ MAN	I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
WILLIAM	No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.

RITZ MAN	Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
WILLIAM	And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...

RITZ MAN	No, sir.
WILLIAM	How about Miss Flintstone?
RITZ MAN	No, sir.
WILLIAM	Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?

RITZ MAN	No, sir.
WILLIAM	Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.

SECURITY	Can I help you?
WILLIAM	Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
SECURITY	Does she know you're coming?
WILLIAM	No, no.  She doesn't.
SECURITY	I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
WILLIAM	Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
SECURITY	... can't let you through.

SPIKE	Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
WILLIAM	This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
SPIKE	That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
WILLIAM	What are the choices?
SPIKE	Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...

WILLIAM	Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
SPIKE	Point taken.

SPIKE	Cool, huh?
WILLIAM	Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
SPIKE	Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.

WILLIAM	Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
SPIKE	Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
WILLIAM	Good luck.

SPIKE	There's something wrong with this yogurt.
WILLIAM	It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
SPIKE	Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.

SPIKE	Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
WILLIAM	Yes, she is fairly fabulous.

SPIKE	Hey.
WILLIAM	Hi...

WILLIAM	Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
SPIKE	Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
WILLIAM	There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
SPIKE	Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.

SPIKE	There's something wrong with the goggles though...
WILLIAM	No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
SPIKE	Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
WILLIAM	So -- any messages?
SPIKE	Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
WILLIAM	Two?  That's it?
SPIKE	You want me to write down all your messages?

WILLIAM	Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
SPIKE	Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
WILLIAM	Right.  No one else?
SPIKE	Absolutely not.

WILLIAM	What did she say?
SPIKE	Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
WILLIAM	Which was?
SPIKE	Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...

SPIKE	Try 'Flintstone.'
WILLIAM	What?
SPIKE	I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
WILLIAM	Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?

WILLIAM	Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
SPIKE	No, 'fraid not.
WILLIAM	Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
SPIKE	That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
WILLIAM	Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.

WILLIAM	Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
SPIKE	You're welcome.  Did you find them?
WILLIAM	Sort of.

WILLIAM	Well, okay.  There's this girl...
SPIKE	Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
WILLIAM	She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.

WILLIAM	I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
SPIKE	I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.

WILLIAM	Oh my God...  Hello.
SPIKE	Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.

WILLIAM	Spike.
SPIKE	I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
WILLIAM	Maybe.
SPIKE	And she's in your house.
WILLIAM	Yes.
SPIKE	And you get on very well.
WILLIAM	Yes.
SPIKE	Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
WILLIAM	Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
SPIKE	Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
WILLIAM	Spike!
SPIKE	No -- you're right.
WILLIAM	I'll talk to you in the morning.
SPIKE	Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.

WILLIAM	I wouldn't go outside.
SPIKE	Why not?
WILLIAM	Just take my work for it.

SPIKE	I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
WILLIAM	Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.

SPIKE	What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
WILLIAM	Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.

WILLIAM	Was it you?
SPIKE	I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
WILLIAM	Right.

SPIKE	What's going on?
WILLIAM	I'm going to throw out these old videos.
SPIKE	No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
WILLIAM	Right -- let's talk about rent...
SPIKE	Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.

WILLIAM	Which floor?
TARQUIN	Three.

WILLIAM	Are you sure you...?
TARQUIN	Yes.
WILLIAM	Oh.  Right.

WILLIAM	No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
TARQUIN	I'm sorry.  Which hospital?

WILLIAM	Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
TARQUIN	Oh sure.  Of course.

TARQUIN	How was she?
WILLIAM	Fabulous.
TARQUIN	Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?

WILLIAM	Excuse me.
THIEF	Yes.
WILLIAM	Bad news.
THIEF	What?
WILLIAM	We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
THIEF	So?
WILLIAM	So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
THIEF	What book?
WILLIAM	The one down your trousers.
THIEF	I haven't got a book down my trousers.
THIEF	Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
WILLIAM	Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.

BARTENDER	He is your husband, no?
KATE	Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
BARTENDER	Si.

BARTENDER	She was your sister.
KATE	No, she wasn't my sister.
BARTENDER	Your mother.
KATE	Of course not.
BARTENDER	Your grandmother?
KATE	Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.

CLERK	May I see your boarding pass, please?
FAITH	I-- I must've misplaced it.
CLERK	I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.

CLERK	Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
FAITH	You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
CLERK	Okay, ma'am, just a moment.

CLERK	You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
FAITH	It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.

FAITH	You ask what room he's in, okay?
CONCIERGE	Buona notte.

FAITH	Excuse me?
CONCIERGE	Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
FAITH	He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
CONCIERGE	I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?

FAITH	Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
CONCIERGE	Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.

FAITH	No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
CONCIERGE	Why?
FAITH	Because.

CONCIERGE	He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
FAITH	So.  How do we get to Rome?

DAMON	So, what's the story with your friend?
KATE	My friend has lost her fucking mind...
DAMON	What's she doing?

KATE	She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
DAMON	What for?
KATE	So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.

DAMON	No, really.  What's she doing?
KATE	Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
DAMON	Seriously.

DAMON	Were they pen pals?
KATE	No.
DAMON	Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
KATE	No.
DAMON	Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?

DAMON'S MOTHER	There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
FAITH	--separate, in the evening..."
DAMON'S MOTHER	Yes.

FAITH	My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
DAMON'S MOTHER	Your hair... is perfect.

DAMON'S MOTHER	But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
FAITH	Okay.  Good idea.  You first.

DAMON'S MOTHER	What?...
FAITH	I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.

DAMON'S MOTHER	Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
FAITH	It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
DAMON'S MOTHER	You're sure...
FAITH	I've never been more sure of anything in my life.

DAMON'S MOTHER	Good.
FAITH	Let's find a telephone.
DAMON'S MOTHER	Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.

FAITH	Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
DAMON'S MOTHER	You're sure...
FAITH	We found each other, didn't we?
DAMON'S MOTHER	Yes.  We did.
FAITH	It's alright...  this is our destiny.

FAITH	What?
DAMON'S MOTHER	My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
FAITH	What is it?

DWAYNE	I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
LARRY	She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
DWAYNE	Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
LARRY	Exactly.

LARRY	Who's dying?
DWAYNE	Your great aunt.
LARRY	What great aunt?

FAITH	You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
FRANCESCA	Oh no.  Do you?
FAITH	No.

FAITH	I'm a liberal!
FRANCESCA	No...
FAITH	My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.

FAITH	There is one other thing you should know about me.
FRANCESCA	Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
FAITH	I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
FRANCESCA	Except possibly that.

FAITH	And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
FRANCESCA	Dwayne?
FAITH	Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.

GIOVANNI	A very large pig.
FAITH	Ask her if she knows where he is?
GIOVANNI	Sa dov'e' lui?

GIOVANNI	No.
FAITH	Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
GIOVANNI	Ha un numero di telefono?

GIOVANNI	...has a prior commitment.
FAITH	What's mezzaluna?
GIOVANNI	A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
FAITH	That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.

LARRY	I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
FAITH	Wait.  I have to write this down.

LARRY	Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
FAITH	Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.

LARRY	Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
FAITH	If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.

FAITH	We'll KNOW.
LARRY	Okaaaaayyyy.

FAITH	Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
LARRY	No.

FAITH	Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
LARRY	Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
FAITH	Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
LARRY	But, Faith--
FAITH	Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.

FAITH	I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
LARRY	But Faith--
FAITH	What?...

FAITH	You...
LEONARD	Hi there...
FAITH	Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.

LEONARD	It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
FAITH	No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
LEONARD	My picture's up?

FAITH	Congratulations.
LEONARD	Thanks.
FAITH	So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
LEONARD	I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?

LEONARD	It's an amazing place, don't you think?
FAITH	Amazing.
LEONARD	Smoking or non-smoking?
FAITH	Non.  Please.

LEONARD	Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
FAITH	Hm.
LEONARD	Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.

FAITH	Hello?  Is anybody there?
PHONE	Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
FAITH	He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
PHONE	Who's this?
FAITH	This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
PHONE	Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.

FAITH	I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
PHONE	My name's 
FAITH	I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?

FAITH	Damon Bradley...
PHONE	Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.

FAITH	WAIT!!  Where are you?
PHONE	I'm at the airport.  Why?
FAITH	Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
PHONE	Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.

FAITH	Where are you going?
PHONE	I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
FAITH	Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
PHONE	Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.

FAITH	That's not the point.
PETER	You said whatever it was you would understand.
FAITH	That was before I found out what it was.

FAITH	How could you do this to me?
PETER	I'm in love with you.
FAITH	Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?

PETER	You're limping.
FAITH	I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
PETER	Are you okay?  You want some help?
FAITH	NO.
PETER	You are leaving, aren't you?

PETER	Why can't you just tell me?
FAITH	If it's any of your business, yes.
PETER	Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
FAITH	Yes.
PETER	To the foot doctor.
FAITH	Yes.

FAITH	Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
PETER	He's safe.
FAITH	So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
PETER	Does he love you?
FAITH	He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
PETER	You didn't answer my question.
FAITH	Why are you asking me this?
PETER	Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?

PETER	You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
FAITH	What?
PETER	He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.

PETER	There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
FAITH	Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
PETER	So?
FAITH	So it wasn't real.
PETER	What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
FAITH	No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.

FAITH	Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
PETER	Because I don't have the right name?!

PETER	Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
FAITH	Who says I don't love him?...

FAITH	Why not?
PETER	Because.  I know where he is.

PETER	I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
FAITH	Where's Positano?
PETER	It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
FAITH	Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
PETER	Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.

FAITH	Why?
PETER	Because-- I want you to be happy.

PETER	The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
FAITH	He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?

PETER	Uh, I'd rather not say.
FAITH	Tell me.
PETER	I'd really rather not say.
FAITH	Please.  I need to know.
PETER	Mickey Spillane.
FAITH	Mickey Spillane?
PETER	Or Hustler.

PETER	He's out by the pool right now.
FAITH	Right now?
PETER	Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.

PETER	Do you want me to do it?
FAITH	NO.

FAITH	Hi, Peter.
PETER	Hi.

PETER	So.  You found him.
FAITH	You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.

PETER	Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
FAITH	Oh.  That's nice.
PETER	Yeah.

PETER	And she's a knock-out, too.
FAITH	Well, good.  Good for you.
PETER	Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?

PETER	Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
FAITH	Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.

PETER	Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
FAITH	You too.

PETER	Hey--
FAITH	What?
PETER	Nice dress.
FAITH	Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.

PETER	What?...
FAITH	What are you doing here?
PETER	We were hungry.

FAITH	You were saying...
PETER	Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?

PETER	Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
FAITH	I don't know if that's such a--

FAITH	Why are you doing this?
PETER	I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
FAITH	So were you.
PETER	Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.

FAITH	Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
PETER	The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--

FAITH	How about music?  You like classical?
PETER	The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.

FAITH	Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
PETER	Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.

PETER	You okay?
FAITH	Yeah.
PETER	I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?

PETER	I'm sorry.
FAITH	I feel like the world's biggest idiot.

PETER	Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
FAITH	No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.

PETER	Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
FAITH	No.  Course not.

PETER	Hi.
FAITH	Hi.  Are you... busy?
PETER	No.  Are you're leaving?
FAITH	No.  I just came by to apologize.

FAITH	It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
PETER	I know the feeling.
FAITH	Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
PETER	You aren't?
FAITH	No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
PETER	Well.  Congratulations.
FAITH	Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
PETER	Are you asking me out?

FAITH	Yes.  I am.
PETER	In that case... no...

PETER	You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
FAITH	I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
PETER	Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.

PETER	Is something the matter?
FAITH	GET OUT!!

PETER	I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
FAITH	You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
PETER	There's no such thing.
FAITH	What?
PETER	Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
FAITH	Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
PETER	I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
FAITH	No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.

PETER	Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
FAITH	I can't believe you did that!
PETER	And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
FAITH	You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
PETER	I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
FAITH	Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
PETER	As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
FAITH	A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
PETER	What would you call it?
FAITH	I would call it-- unforgivable.

PETER	Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
FAITH	Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
PETER	Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
FAITH	Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
PETER	Very funny.
FAITH	No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.

PETER	Really?...
FAITH	Yes.

PETER	And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
FAITH	That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
PETER	If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.

PETER	Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
FAITH	There is no us.

PETER	I was hoping for the real thing.
FAITH	I brought you that, too.

FAITH	You're Damon Bradley?
HIM	Uh huh.

HIM	Hello.
FAITH	Beautiful place...
HIM	Sure is.

FAITH	Been here long?
HIM	Just since yesterday.
FAITH	I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.

FAITH	I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
HIM	Tonight?
FAITH	Any night.
HIM	Well, not exactly...
FAITH	Would you be willing to have dinner with me?

HIM	Sure.
FAITH	You would?  Really?

HIM	I'll look forward to it.
FAITH	Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.

HIM	Wait.
FAITH	Yes?
HIM	Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
FAITH	Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
HIM	It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.

FAITH	Sure.
HIM	Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.

HIM	You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
FAITH	Really?
HIM	Really...

FAITH	Well, to-- new friends.
HIM	And more...

FAITH	Excuse me?
HIM	Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
FAITH	Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.

FAITH	What looks good?
HIM	Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
FAITH	You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.

HIM	So what do you think?
FAITH	Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.

HIM	Faith, this is my mother.
FAITH	Oh, hello.
HIM	Mommy, this is Faith.

FAITH	So, you say you've been to Italy before?
HIM	A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--

HIM	So, what are we waiting for?
FAITH	What?
HIM	Let's face it.  You want me.

KATE	I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
FAITH	Yeah.  He's around somewhere.

FAITH	I don't believe in statistics.
KATE	You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.

KATE	What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
FAITH	No.  He smokes.
KATE	How about the other one?  His friend.
FAITH	Just moved in with his girlfriend.
KATE	How about that guy at the bank?

FAITH	Scientologist.
KATE	Oh.

KATE	So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
FAITH	Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--

FAITH	I don't have an Amana freezer.
KATE	It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
FAITH	Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
KATE	I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.

FAITH	Is everything okay?
KATE	Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
FAITH	But somebody wrote those songs.
KATE	So, what's your point?
FAITH	Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
KATE	No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.

FAITH	I wish you didn't have to go so early.
KATE	Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.

FAITH	No.
KATE	Is he married?
FAITH	No.
KATE	Is he gay?
FAITH	I don't know.  I don't think so.
KATE	So?...
FAITH	So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.

KATE	What's he do?
FAITH	I don't know, Kate.
KATE	You don't have any idea?
FAITH	He's a podiatrist or something.

KATE	Thrills?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
FAITH	No.  He's never asked me.
KATE	Why don't you ask him?
FAITH	Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
KATE	If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?

KATE	He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
FAITH	Yes you did.
KATE	Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.

KATE	Come on, it's not so bad.
FAITH	Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
KATE	I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
FAITH	I know...  It was.

KATE	But what?
FAITH	Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
KATE	That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.

KATE	But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
FAITH	Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.

KATE	Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
FAITH	I know.  You're right.
KATE	People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.

FAITH	I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
KATE	I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.

FAITH	Kate, is something the matter?
KATE	Larry brought me flowers last night.
FAITH	Is that bad?...
KATE	I think he's having an affair.

FAITH	Have you seen him with someone?
KATE	No...  I can just tell.
FAITH	After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--

FAITH	It's a miracle.
KATE	It's a coincidence.
FAITH	The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.

FAITH	It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
KATE	But it's July.
FAITH	It's still the new year...
KATE	What about your job?
FAITH	I have vacation time coming to me.
KATE	You don't have a passport.
FAITH	That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
KATE	Because you were afraid to fly.
FAITH	Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
KATE	Does Dwayne know about this?
FAITH	Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.

KATE	I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
FAITH	Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 

FAITH	No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
KATE	My God, you have...

FAITH	Thank you so much.
KATE	You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
FAITH	He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 

KATE	A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
FAITH	How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
KATE	Live happily ever after.
FAITH	Maybe.

KATE	I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
FAITH	You're coming with me?

KATE	You okay?
FAITH	Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?

FAITH	Now what do we do?
KATE	The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
FAITH	It's called... the Gritty Palace.
KATE	Gritty?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
FAITH	I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.

KATE	This is a Lifestyles hotel.
FAITH	What?
KATE	Of the Rich and Famous.  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
FAITH	Are you sure?
KATE	Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
FAITH	Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.

FAITH	I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
KATE	You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
FAITH	We lost him?...

FAITH	I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
KATE	You and the other 99% of the women in the world.

FAITH	Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
KATE	Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.

KATE	What are you doing?
FAITH	He fell out.

KATE	You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
FAITH	Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
KATE	I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?

KATE	I just got a dial tone--
FAITH	The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
KATE	So?
FAITH	So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.

FAITH	Ah ha!...
KATE	What'd you find?
FAITH	A Butterfinger wrapper.
KATE	A rich, possibly fat, slob.
FAITH	Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
KATE	We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
FAITH	Oh.  Right.

FAITH	We're saved!
KATE	What is it?
FAITH	A phone message.  Only--
KATE	Only what?
FAITH	Only, it's in Italian...

KATE	Your brother?
FAITH	What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?

KATE	Couldn't we just have taken a train?
FAITH	The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.

FAITH	I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
KATE	We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
FAITH	Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.

KATE	I'm hungry.
FAITH	You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
KATE	What's that supposed to mean?...
FAITH	Nothing.

FAITH	You expecting somebody you know?
KATE	Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
FAITH	Sorry.

KATE	So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
FAITH	I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
KATE	You think he misses me at all?
FAITH	'Course he does.
KATE	You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.

KATE	That was a long time ago.
FAITH	And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.

KATE	He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
FAITH	Larry bought himself cologne?
KATE	Polo.

FAITH	Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
KATE	Her brother.
FAITH	Right.  My brother.

KATE	What did you say to her?
FAITH	I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
KATE	What's she saying?

FAITH	All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
KATE	You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.

FAITH	I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
KATE	You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?

KATE	So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
FAITH	I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.

KATE	Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
FAITH	Because I'm the one who's single.
KATE	I never even got to be single.
FAITH	Sure you did.
KATE	Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
FAITH	Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?

KATE	He's heeeeeerrre...
FAITH	Oh my God.  Where?
KATE	He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
FAITH	Is he looking at us?
KATE	Nope.

FAITH	Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
KATE	Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
FAITH	Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.

KATE	Faith--
FAITH	What?
KATE	Good luck.

KATE	Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
FAITH	Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
KATE	And then what, Faith?
FAITH	And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.

KATE	That was really sweet...
FAITH	I meant about my idea.
KATE	I think it's time we got some professional help.
FAITH	Like a detective.
KATE	No... Like a psychiatrist.
FAITH	Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?

KATE	Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
FAITH	But how could he know?  He only just met me.
KATE	Men have ways.

KATE	Hi-iii...
FAITH	Hi.  Where've you been?
KATE	Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
FAITH	Packing.
KATE	Why?
FAITH	Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
KATE	So, you've had a little bad luck.
FAITH	A little bad luck?
KATE	Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.

FAITH	Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
KATE	So you're just quitting?  Just like that?

FAITH	I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
KATE	I know, but...
FAITH	It was a ouija board, remember?
KATE	...and a fortune teller.
FAITH	Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
KATE	What about Peter?...
FAITH	Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
FAITH	The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
KATE	Who said I was going?
FAITH	What?
KATE	I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.

FAITH	No.  No, you go ahead.
KATE	You sure you'll be okay?
FAITH	I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
KATE	I'll be back before you leave.

KATE	Peter found him?
FAITH	Yes.  Isn't that amazing?

KATE	Amazing...
FAITH	He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.

KATE	Joan Collins stayed here.
FAITH	Is Damon Bradley here?

KATE	Whatareyoudoing?!
FAITH	What if he doesn't like me?
KATE	It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
FAITH	My God... you're right.
KATE	Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?

FAITH	Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
KATE	Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?

KATE	Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
FAITH	No one's perfect, Kate.
KATE	And he is living proof.
FAITH	No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.

FAITH	Maybe I can change him.
KATE	I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.

FAITH	Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
KATE	Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.

FAITH	He's a jerk.
KATE	Yes.  He is.
FAITH	I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
KATE	Yup.
FAITH	I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
KATE	When you could've found one in America.

KATE	So...
FAITH	So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.

FAITH	Kate is that you?
KATE	Uh huh.
FAITH	I didn't expect you back so soon.

KATE	Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
FAITH	Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
KATE	Oh.

KATE	Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
FAITH	And Larry?...
KATE	What about Larry?
FAITH	I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.

FAITH	I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
KATE	He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
FAITH	Larry, did you rent a car?

GIOVANNI	And you are?...
KATE	Kate.
GIOVANNI	You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
KATE	No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
GIOVANNI	This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.

KATE	My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
GIOVANNI	She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
KATE	A porco?
GIOVANNI	A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.

GIOVANNI	Oh.
KATE	Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
GIOVANNI	Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
KATE	I'd love to.

GIOVANNI	It's siesta.
KATE	Oh.
GIOVANNI	You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...

KATE	How old are you?
GIOVANNI	What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...

KATE	Giovanni, I want to thank you.
GIOVANNI	I thank you.

KATE	No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
GIOVANNI	You don't have to go if you don't want to...
KATE	But I do want to.

GIOVANNI	You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
KATE	Giovanni.
GIOVANNI	Huh?
KATE	That's exactly what you are.

LARRY	Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
KATE	You miss me?...
LARRY	Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
KATE	No, why?
LARRY	Well, there's nothing here to eat.

LARRY	This is the last one before the wedding, right?
KATE	Right.
LARRY	And we didn't have to bring another present?
KATE	No.

KATE	Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
LARRY	It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
KATE	Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
LARRY	We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
KATE	Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
LARRY	You used to love it when I called you doll.
KATE	You said it differently then.

LARRY	Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
KATE	What?  You know him?
LARRY	It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
KATE	Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
LARRY	He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
KATE	Went to high school with him. But...

LARRY	I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
LARRY	It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
KATE	Larry, you've got to tell her.
LARRY	I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.

LARRY	I came after the woman I love.
KATE	He missed me.

LARRY	Yeah--
KATE	Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.

KATE	She what?!
LARRY	She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
KATE	And you didn't tell her?
LARRY	She didn't give me a chance.

PETER	I have to talk to her.
KATE	She's not here.
PETER	Where is she?
KATE	She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
PETER	No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??

PETER	It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
KATE	Good strategy.
PETER	Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.

PETER	And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
KATE	Mania.
PETER	Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.

PETER	And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
KATE	That's really romantic.

PETER	I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
KATE	Ten billion to one.

KATE	That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
PETER	Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?

KATE	Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
PETER	Thanks.
KATE	Sorry...

FOLEY	That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
ADELE	Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
FOLEY	You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
ADELE	Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
FOLEY	I said not as a rule.
ADELE	So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
FOLEY	Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
ADELE	What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
FOLEY	What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
ADELE	Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
FOLEY	Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
ADELE	And the one driving the other car?
FOLEY	What're you talking about?
ADELE	Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
FOLEY	Glenn Michaels.
ADELE	Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
FOLEY	He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.

CHINO	Oh, is this Adele?
ADELE	Yes, it is.
CHINO	Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.

CHINO	I want to speak with you, please.
ADELE	Who is it?

ADELE	Lie face down on the floor.
CHINO	What?!

ADELE	Yes.
CHINO	You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
ADELE	Yes.
CHINO	Tell me, how do you do that?

ADELE	You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
KAREN	From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.

KAREN	The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
ADELE	They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
KAREN	But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
ADELE	I know a Glenn.

ADELE	I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
KAREN	No, thanks.

ADELE	He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
KAREN	You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
ADELE	He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.

KAREN	You didn't visit him in prison.
ADELE	He didn't want me to.
KAREN	Why not?
ADELE	I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
KAREN	But you spoke to him on the phone.
ADELE	He'd call every once in a while.
KAREN	He called the day he escaped.
ADELE	He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
KAREN	He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
ADELE	Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
KAREN	Did you know that when you married him?
ADELE	He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.

ADELE	I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
KAREN	Really.  Hm.

KAREN	Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
ADELE	Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?

ADELE	Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
KAREN	Till they got busted.
ADELE	That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
KAREN	Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?

KAREN	Ask him his name.
ADELE	Who are you?

ADELE	You're good.
KAREN	Thank you.

CHINO'S VOICE	Adele?  You in there?
ADELE	Yes.

CHINO'S VOICE	I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
ADELE	Oh.  Uh-huh.
CHINO'S VOICE	You did work for Emil, right?
ADELE	Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
CHINO'S VOICE	You were his what, his box?
ADELE	His assistant.

ADELE	You say you perform in the Miami area?
CHINO'S VOICE	Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.

ADELE	I'm not dressed.
CHINO'S VOICE	Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

ADELE	Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
CHINO'S VOICE	Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.

ADELE	I don't know where he is.
CHINO'S VOICE	Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
ADELE	Go away, or I'll call the police.
CHINO'S VOICE	Why you want to do that, to a frien'?

FOLEY	It's Richard Ripley.
BUDDY	The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.

FOLEY	I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
BUDDY	Why don't we talk about it later?

FOLEY	Where in the hell are we?
BUDDY	That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
FOLEY	Okay, honey, come on out of there.

BUDDY	We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
FOLEY	She's coming with us.

BUDDY	Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
FOLEY	Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.

FOLEY	Do we need him?
BUDDY	The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...

FOLEY	Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
BUDDY	I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.

FOLEY	Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
BUDDY	How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
FOLEY	His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.

FOLEY	I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
BUDDY	He ain't the problem, Jack.

BUDDY	You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
FOLEY	I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
BUDDY	You're too late, Jack.

FOLEY	I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
BUDDY	Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.

FOLEY	You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
BUDDY	You're right.

FOLEY	I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
BUDDY	There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
FOLEY	Oh, man.
BUDDY	There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
FOLEY	I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
BUDDY	There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
FOLEY	Sounds great.

BUDDY	They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
FOLEY	I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
BUDDY	Maybe this'll make you feel better.

BUDDY	Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
FOLEY	Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
BUDDY	Just that she got away.
FOLEY	Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
BUDDY	You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.

FOLEY	Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
BUDDY	Am I going to Detroit by myself?

BUDDY	Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
FOLEY	We'll leave first thing in the morning.

FOLEY	What?!
BUDDY	You better come see this.

FOLEY	Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
BUDDY	He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
FOLEY	He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
BUDDY	He knows where she lives?

BUDDY	Jack?
FOLEY	We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
BUDDY	So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
FOLEY	Her phone's probably tapped.
BUDDY	And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
FOLEY	Shit.

BUDDY	Nice disguise.
FOLEY	I'm a tourist.
BUDDY	You at least bring the gun?
FOLEY	In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.

BUDDY	There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
FOLEY	Uh-huh...

FOLEY	I guess Adele's in good hands.
BUDDY	Sure looks that way.
FOLEY	Let's go to Detroit.
BUDDY	Now you're talkin'.

FOLEY	First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
BUDDY	I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
FOLEY	Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
BUDDY	Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
FOLEY	Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
BUDDY	He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.

BUDDY	They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
FOLEY	She just sat there, looking right at me.

BUDDY	Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying.  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
FOLEY	Love is funny.

BUDDY	Whatta you think?
FOLEY	I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
BUDDY	Or two.

FOLEY	Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
BUDDY	What's he do now, tell fortunes?

BUDDY	Outside of that.
FOLEY	Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
BUDDY	She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.

FOLEY	I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
BUDDY	They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
FOLEY	You tell your sister about it?
BUDDY	Just hung up.
FOLEY	How long you talk to her?
BUDDY	Two hours.
FOLEY	How long were you with the girl?
BUDDY	Forty-five minutes.
FOLEY	You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
BUDDY	Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
FOLEY	Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.

BUDDY	Now that's a really big house.
FOLEY	Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
BUDDY	No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
FOLEY	Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
BUDDY	Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
FOLEY	Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
BUDDY	Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
FOLEY	Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
BUDDY	What about that D.B. Cooper guy?

BUDDY	I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
FOLEY	Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
BUDDY	My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
FOLEY	Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
BUDDY	You might not have a choice.

BUDDY	They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
FOLEY	They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?

FOLEY	Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
BUDDY	Yeah, and I better call my sister.

BUDDY	It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
FOLEY	I saw Karen Sisco.

BUDDY	And she saw you?
FOLEY	Yes, she did.
BUDDY	So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
FOLEY	You know how I felt about her.
BUDDY	Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
FOLEY	It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
BUDDY	You find out?
FOLEY	Yeah, I did.

BUDDY	So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
FOLEY	I don't know.

FOLEY	They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
BUDDY	Whatta you wanna do?

BUDDY	You know they gonna set us up.
FOLEY	I get that feeling, yeah.
BUDDY	But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?

FOLEY	I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
BUDDY	Half for doing what?
FOLEY	Getting me out of Glades for starters.
BUDDY	And who watches your back?

FOLEY	There's still time, take me up on my offer.
BUDDY	I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.

FOLEY	You ever wear one of these?
BUDDY	I don't ski.
FOLEY	Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.

BUDDY	They found the safe.
FOLEY	You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
BUDDY	Yeah, hi.  Nice house.

BUDDY	They look like plain old rocks.
FOLEY	They sure do.

BUDDY	Come <i>on</i>.
FOLEY	Shit.
BUDDY	What?
FOLEY	They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
BUDDY	From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
FOLEY	And then they'll kill 'em.
BUDDY	At least.

FOLEY	We made it, didn't we?
BUDDY	All you gotta do is get in.

FOLEY	I'm going back inside.
BUDDY	I'll go with you.

FOLEY	No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
BUDDY	Jack --
FOLEY	Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone.

KAREN	Hello, Daniel.
BURDON	Daniel Burdon, FBI.

KAREN	I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
BURDON	That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
KAREN	Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
BURDON	Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
KAREN	Coming to the Okeechobee exit...

BURDON	There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
KAREN	Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
BURDON	You talked to him?
KAREN	In the trunk, yeah?
BURDON	What'd you talk about?
KAREN	Oh... different things, prison, movies.
BURDON	This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
KAREN	It was an unusual experience.
BURDON	Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
KAREN	When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
BURDON	Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
KAREN	And what happened to Carl?
BURDON	The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
KAREN	Is that what you would've done?
BURDON	You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
KAREN	Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
BURDON	Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
KAREN	Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
BURDON	I have to qualify, is that it?
KAREN	You have to know what you're talking about.

BURDON	We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
KAREN	You'll have to ask him.
BURDON	Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.

KAREN	Shut up.
BURDON	Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
KAREN	Daniel.  Listen --
BURDON	Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
KAREN	I'm at Adele Delisi's.
BURDON	What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
KAREN	Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
BURDON	There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
KAREN	All right, but...
BURDON	But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
KAREN	Sure, Daniel.
BURDON	Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
KAREN	Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
BURDON	What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
KAREN	Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
BURDON	Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
KAREN	That's all I wanted to know.
BURDON	Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.

BURDON	You get the key?
KAREN	They're in 7D.

BURDON	You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
KAREN	You're gonna use a ram?
BURDON	Yeah, why?
KAREN	The manager's door is metal.

BURDON	Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
KAREN	What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
BURDON	You can go wait out in the car, you want to.

BURDON	Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
KAREN	Call and tell you.
BURDON	And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?

KAREN	Leave it where it is.
CHINO	Wait.  You not Adele?
KAREN	I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
CHINO	Oh.  Then this must be Adele...

KAREN	Put it down or I'll shoot.
CHINO	You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
KAREN	What do you want to bet?
CHINO	I could walk out of here.
KAREN	If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.

KAREN	You can live or die, it's up to you.
CHINO	Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
KAREN	You don't, huh?

KAREN	Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
CHINO	Excuse me, Adele?

FOLEY	You excited?
CHINO	I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
FOLEY	Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
CHINO	Why you think is today?
FOLEY	You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.

CHINO	You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
FOLEY	You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.

CHINO	You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
FOLEY	I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.

CRUZ	Ironic, isn't it?
KAREN	How are you, Raymond?
CRUZ	Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.

KAREN	Quite a mess.
CRUZ	Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
KAREN	Who?
CRUZ	Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
KAREN	What is it with crack and transsexuals?
CRUZ	Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
KAREN	Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
CRUZ	Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.

CRUZ	Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
KAREN	I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
CRUZ	You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
KAREN	No, I didn't know that.
CRUZ	Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
KAREN	Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
CRUZ	Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
KAREN	Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
CRUZ	Who was the friend?
KAREN	Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
CRUZ	Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
KAREN	I'll need a last known address.
CRUZ	That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
KAREN	Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.

KAREN	Hello?
CRUZ	We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
KAREN	Oh-kay...

CRUZ	Karen, I told you not to--
KAREN	Wait, I know him --okay?

FOLEY	Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
MAURICE	There a problem, Foley?
FOLEY	Yeah.

FOLEY	Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
MAURICE	That's right.

FOLEY	How much for your company at chow?
MAURICE	Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
FOLEY	I bet.  How much?
MAURICE	Another C.

MAURICE	This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
FOLEY	I don't smoke.

MAURICE	Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
FOLEY	Thirty-two outta what, twenty?

FOLEY	Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
MAURICE	It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
FOLEY	Low class of people there, Snoop.

FOLEY	Like being back in the yard, huh?
MAURICE	Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
FOLEY	Glenn didn't tell you?

FOLEY	Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
MAURICE	Let's go outside and talk.
FOLEY	What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
MAURICE	Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.

FOLEY	Who's sitting here?
MAURICE	Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.

MAURICE	Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
FOLEY	We're leaving.
MAURICE	The fuck you talking about?
FOLEY	Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...

MAURICE	Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
FOLEY	I thought everything.

MAURICE	Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
FOLEY	Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
MAURICE	You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
FOLEY	I wasn't asking permission.

FOLEY	That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
MAURICE	Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
FOLEY	So you've done this before, huh?
MAURICE	Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.

MAURICE	Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
FOLEY	That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
MAURICE	Hey.  You learn from doing.

MAURICE	You know how to use one a these?
FOLEY	I've seen 'em used on TV.

FOLEY	Good luck, Richard.
MAURICE	Someone down here?

MAURICE	Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
FOLEY	Not until recently.
MAURICE	Nervous?
FOLEY	A little.
MAURICE	This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
FOLEY	You're right.  So why take a chance--

FOLEY	Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
KAREN	I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.

FOLEY	You comfy?
KAREN	If I could have a little more room.
FOLEY	There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
KAREN	For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
FOLEY	You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.

FOLEY	Where's your gun, your pistol?
KAREN	In my bag, in the car.

FOLEY	Boy, it stunk in there.
KAREN	I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
FOLEY	Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
KAREN	The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
FOLEY	Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
KAREN	You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
FOLEY	If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
KAREN	Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.

FOLEY	Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
KAREN	Buddy.  That's his given name?
FOLEY	One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...

KAREN	So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
FOLEY	Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
KAREN	Why, are you famous?
FOLEY	Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
KAREN	How many was that?
FOLEY	Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
KAREN	That's funny.
FOLEY	I thought so, too.
KAREN	It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
FOLEY	I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
KAREN	I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
FOLEY	Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
KAREN	I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.

FOLEY	You don't seem all that scared.
KAREN	Of course I am.
FOLEY	You don't act like it.
KAREN	What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
FOLEY	Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
KAREN	You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
FOLEY	It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
KAREN	Uh-huh.
FOLEY	We still talk, though.
KAREN	Sure.

KAREN	You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
FOLEY	Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
KAREN	You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.

FOLEY	Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
KAREN	I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
FOLEY	Is that right?
KAREN	They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
FOLEY	You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
KAREN	It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.

FOLEY	That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
KAREN	Faye Dunaway.
FOLEY	Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
KAREN	<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
FOLEY	And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
KAREN	Peter Finch.
FOLEY	Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
KAREN	Bleeding on a country road.
FOLEY	It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.

FOLEY	You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
KAREN	Nothing.
FOLEY	I mean if you didn't know who I was.
KAREN	You'd probably tell me.
FOLEY	I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
KAREN	You have to be kidding.

FOLEY	Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
KAREN	With Robert Redford, when he was young.
FOLEY	Yeah...

KAREN	I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
FOLEY	Really.
KAREN	I mean, romantically.
FOLEY	Uh-huh.  Well, but if --

KAREN	Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
FOLEY	Shit...

FOLEY	You know who this is?
KAREN	Yes.

KAREN	How'd you get this number?
FOLEY	Who was it answered the phone?
KAREN	None of your business.
FOLEY	I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
KAREN	That's my dad.
FOLEY	Really.  He has a cop's face.
KAREN	How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
FOLEY	And your gun.
KAREN	Think I could have them back?
FOLEY	How do we do that?
KAREN	Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
FOLEY	Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.

KAREN	There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
FOLEY	You won't do that.
KAREN	Why not?
FOLEY	Because you're having too much fun.

KAREN	My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
FOLEY	I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
KAREN	Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
FOLEY	Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
KAREN	Unless you wanna tell me.
FOLEY	He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
KAREN	One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
FOLEY	I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
KAREN	Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
FOLEY	I just thought maybe you and me could--

KAREN	It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
FOLEY	I can go to the bar.
KAREN	Don't leave me.
FOLEY	Those guys bother you?
KAREN	No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.

FOLEY	You like bourbon?
KAREN	Love it.
FOLEY	Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
KAREN	I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
FOLEY	Is that how you think of yourself?
KAREN	What, as a sales rep?
FOLEY	A girl.
KAREN	I don't have a problem with it.
FOLEY	I like your hair.  And that suit.
KAREN	I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
FOLEY	You did?
KAREN	It smelled.
FOLEY	Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
KAREN	No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
FOLEY	How far do we go with this?

KAREN	Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
FOLEY	I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
KAREN	It's your game.  I've never played this before.
FOLEY	It's not a game.  Something you play.
KAREN	Well, does it make sense to you?
FOLEY	It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
KAREN	Or once.

KAREN	Oh, God...
FOLEY	I called your room from downstairs.
KAREN	If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
FOLEY	Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
KAREN	If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
FOLEY	It would be worth the risk.

KAREN	You like taking risks.
FOLEY	So do you.

KAREN	You really wear that suit.
FOLEY	That's not what you were about to say.

KAREN	Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
FOLEY	She did, huh.
KAREN	You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
FOLEY	Yeah, but in a nice way.

FOLEY	I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
KAREN	He killed a police officer.

FOLEY	I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
KAREN	You believe that?
FOLEY	Why not?

KAREN	What were you gonna do with me?
FOLEY	I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
KAREN	You waved to me in the elevator.

FOLEY	I wasn't sure you caught that.
KAREN	I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
FOLEY	Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.

FOLEY	You know I saw you on the street.
KAREN	Where?
FOLEY	Outside Adele's.

KAREN	You were going to see her?
FOLEY	To warn her about Chino.
KAREN	So she did help you?
FOLEY	I don't think we should get into that.
KAREN	No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
FOLEY	Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.

FOLEY	You coming back?
KAREN	I'm just going to the bathroom.

KAREN	I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
FOLEY	Why are you mad?
KAREN	Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
FOLEY	What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
KAREN	I don't know.

KAREN	You're not dumb.
FOLEY	I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.

FOLEY	You getting serious on me now?
KAREN	I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
FOLEY	You know.

KAREN	Come on, Jack -- don't.
FOLEY	Pretend I'm somebody else.
KAREN	You think I'd shoot you?

FOLEY	If you don't, one of those guys will.
KAREN	What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
FOLEY	I told you, I'm not going back.

KAREN	I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
FOLEY	You just did, for Christ sake.
KAREN	You know what I mean.

GLENN	He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
FOLEY	Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
GLENN	You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
FOLEY	I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
GLENN	I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.

GLENN	Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
FOLEY	Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
GLENN	So.  What's your point?
FOLEY	My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
GLENN	You think he's lying?
FOLEY	Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?

FOLEY	Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
GLENN	Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
FOLEY	Oh, nuthin'.

FOLEY	Take your sunglasses off.
GLENN	I see better with them on.
FOLEY	You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.

FOLEY	Wait in the car.
GLENN	You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
FOLEY	I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
GLENN	In the trunk?
FOLEY	The backseat.

FOLEY	Weren't you expecting us?
GLENN	That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?

GLENN	She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
FOLEY	Yeah?  She said that to you?

FOLEY	What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
GLENN	I don't know...

FOLEY	Whose blood you got all over you?
GLENN	These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.

GLENN	I thought you guys were busted.
FOLEY	Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?

FOLEY	Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
PUP	How many?
FOLEY	I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
PUP	Okay.  How many going out?
FOLEY	I hear six.
PUP	When?
FOLEY	Looks like tonight.
PUP	You know who they are?
FOLEY	I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.

FOLEY	You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
RIPLEY	Oh, uh, right, thanks...

RIPLEY	Sounds high, doesn't it?
FOLEY	Must be a real soft pillow.

FOLEY	You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
RIPLEY	Really?  Well, I uhhh...
FOLEY	First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.

RIPLEY	Thanks for your help.
FOLEY	Any time.

RIPLEY	Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
FOLEY	I don't know.  I never used a gun.
RIPLEY	Really?
FOLEY	You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
RIPLEY	You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
FOLEY	No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
RIPLEY	I know what you're talking about.
FOLEY	You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
RIPLEY	Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
FOLEY	Of course not.
RIPLEY	Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
FOLEY	Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
RIPLEY	It's a big house.

RIPLEY	Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
FOLEY	Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
RIPLEY	I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.

FOLEY	It's a little late for me.
RIPLEY	Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
FOLEY	I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
RIPLEY	Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
FOLEY	My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
RIPLEY	No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
FOLEY	The fish?
RIPLEY	Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
FOLEY	I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
RIPLEY	The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
FOLEY	And the guy sent you a bill for this?
RIPLEY	It works.  You should try it sometime.
FOLEY	The next time I walk into a bank.

FOLEY	I still haven't made up my mind yet.
RIPLEY	What's to think about?
FOLEY	You goin' right back to work?
RIPLEY	First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.

RIPLEY	Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
FOLEY	How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
RIPLEY	Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.

RIPLEY	Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
FOLEY	Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."

RIPLEY	Foley?  That you?
FOLEY	How are you, Richard?
RIPLEY	Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
FOLEY	Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
RIPLEY	Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.

RIPLEY	Have they got Midge up there?
FOLEY	What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
RIPLEY	We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
FOLEY	A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.

RIPLEY	What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
FOLEY	You gonna write me a check?
RIPLEY	We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.

RIPLEY	Good God... they're shooting Midge!
FOLEY	Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.

RIPLEY	I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
FOLEY	I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.

FOLEY	Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
RIPLEY	Five point two.

FOLEY	I were you, I'd get up and run.
RIPLEY	I'm not leaving Midge.
FOLEY	Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
RIPLEY	If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.

FOLEY	<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
HEJIRA	Islamic.
FOLEY	What's it mean, "No Hair"?
HEJIRA	The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
FOLEY	The flight?
HEJIRA	The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
FOLEY	You were at Leavenworth, huh?
HEJIRA	For a time.
FOLEY	Meaning?
HEJIRA	Meaning time came, I left.
FOLEY	You busted out?
HEJIRA	I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
FOLEY	And how long was it before they caught up with you?
HEJIRA	That time?
FOLEY	There were others.
HEJIRA	Yeah.  That was the ninth.
FOLEY	The <u>ninth</u>?
HEJIRA	Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
FOLEY	You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
HEJIRA	Hejira.
FOLEY	And so now you're off to Glades.
HEJIRA	Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
FOLEY	She did, huh.
HEJIRA	Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
FOLEY	Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
HEJIRA	Like what?
FOLEY	I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.

KAREN	I'll send it to you at Glades.
GLENN	Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?

GLENN	I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
KAREN	Glenn?

KAREN	You don't remember me, do you?
GLENN	It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
KAREN	No, that's not what I'm thinking.

GLENN	But you're sure we've met, huh?
KAREN	Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.

KAREN	Do we have a gun in the car?
GLENN	I remember you now.  Shit.
KAREN	Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.

KAREN	Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
GLENN	We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
KAREN	Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...

KAREN	Take the next exit.
GLENN	What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
KAREN	Glenn, take the exit.
GLENN	No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.

KAREN	Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
GLENN	Jesus, I don't believe it.
KAREN	Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?

GLENN	I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
KAREN	You're not?
GLENN	I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
KAREN	The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
GLENN	Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?

KAREN	Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
GLENN	You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
KAREN	For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
GLENN	Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
KAREN	What's going on, Glenn?
GLENN	Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
KAREN	But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
GLENN	Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
KAREN	Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
GLENN	Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
KAREN	And is Foley a part of this?
GLENN	He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
KAREN	Why's that?
GLENN	Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
KAREN	But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
GLENN	I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
KAREN	Gee, I wonder why not.
GLENN	I'm freezing my ass off.
KAREN	You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
GLENN	Really?
KAREN	But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
GLENN	I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
KAREN	If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.

GLENN	Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
MAURICE	Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.

GLENN	Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
MAURICE	You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
GLENN	I wanna talk to you about a job.
MAURICE	Uh-huh.
GLENN	I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
MAURICE	Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
GLENN	It's a guy you know.
MAURICE	Gimme another hint.
GLENN	It's Richard Ripley.

GLENN	You there?
MAURICE	Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?

MAURICE	Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
GLENN	Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
MAURICE	It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.

MAURICE	You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
GLENN	If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.

GLENN	So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
MAURICE	I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
GLENN	What?

GLENN	Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
MAURICE	You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.

MAURICE	Thing I'm worried about is you.
GLENN	Me?
MAURICE	Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
GLENN	Can I do what?
MAURICE	Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
GLENN	What-- when?
MAURICE	Right now, son.
GLENN	I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
MAURICE	Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
GLENN	I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
MAURICE	Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?

MAURICE	That was some shit, huh?
GLENN	Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
MAURICE	Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.

GLENN	It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
MAURICE	No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
GLENN	Why would I do that?

KAREN	Hi, Ray.
RAY	You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
KAREN	He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.

KAREN	How's it going?
RAY	Great.  We got one of 'em.

RAY	Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
KAREN	Oh...
RAY	We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.

KAREN	You're a fighter?
KENNETH	How you know that?
KAREN	I can tell.
KENNETH	I <i>was</i>...

KAREN	What'd you fight, middleweight?
KENNETH	Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
KAREN	Flyweight.
KENNETH	You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
KAREN	You're not my type.
KENNETH	Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
KAREN	Just a minute.

KENNETH	What's wrong with you?
KAREN	You wanted to tussle, we tussled.

KAREN	Moselle Miller?
MOSELLE	What do you want?
KAREN	I'm looking for Maurice.
MOSELLE	You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.

KAREN	That's not Maurice?
MOSELLE	That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.

MOSELLE	You like to sit down?
KAREN	Thanks.

KAREN	I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
MOSELLE	You not with probation, one of those?
KAREN	No.
MOSELLE	You a lawyer?
KAREN	No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?

MOSELLE	Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
KAREN	He said he stayed here last November.
MOSELLE	Here?  In this house?
KAREN	He said he stayed with Maurice.
MOSELLE	Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
KAREN	Your dog was killed?
MOSELLE	Got run over by a car.
KAREN	What did you call it?

MOSELLE	Was a she, name Tuffy.
KAREN	Where do you think I might find Maurice?
MOSELLE	I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
KAREN	The State Theater?

KAREN	You fit another Chanel suit in here?
MARSHALL	Something better.  Open it.

KAREN	It's beautiful.
MARSHALL	It's a --
KAREN	--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.

KAREN	Thanks, Dad.
MARSHALL	Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
KAREN	Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
MARSHALL	Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
KAREN	He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
MARSHALL	He's still married though, huh?
KAREN	Technically.  They're separated.
MARSHALL	Oh, he's moved out?
KAREN	He's about to.
MARSHALL	Then they're not separated, are they?
KAREN	Can we change the subject?
MARSHALL	What're you doing at Glades?
KAREN	Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
MARSHALL	You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
KAREN	No thanks.
MARSHALL	You used to like it.
KAREN	Dad...
MARSHALL	You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
KAREN	I really gotta go.
MARSHALL	We don't get to talk much any more.
KAREN	How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
MARSHALL	I'd like that.

MARSHALL	You were talking in your sleep.
KAREN	What'd I say?
MARSHALL	Hey, yourself.
KAREN	Huh.

MARSHALL	What are you thinking about?
KAREN	The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
MARSHALL	Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.

KAREN	He doesn't even look like that.
MARSHALL	No?
KAREN	No, he looks a lot...

KAREN	Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
MARSHALL	I see that.

KAREN	Was it Foley?
MARSHALL	Off a tip?

MARSHALL	Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
KAREN	Hello?

MARSHALL	Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
KAREN	He's pretty laid back, confident.
MARSHALL	He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
KAREN	Not at all.
MARSHALL	But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
KAREN	I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
MARSHALL	Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
KAREN	My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
MARSHALL	You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
KAREN	Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
MARSHALL	Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.

MARSHALL	He waved to you?
KAREN	I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
MARSHALL	You wave back?
KAREN	I didn't have time.
MARSHALL	I imagine you would've though.

KAREN	Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
MARSHALL	So?
KAREN	So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
MARSHALL	He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
KAREN	None I'd like to share.

MARSHALL	You gonna go get him?
KAREN	It's possible.  Why?
MARSHALL	I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
KAREN	He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
MARSHALL	My little girl, the tough babe.

MAURICE	Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
MAID	I told you, he isn't here.
MAURICE	Out for the evening?
MAID	He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
MAURICE	When's he due back?

MAURICE	You here all by yourself?
MAID	That's right, just me.

MAURICE	Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
MAID	I don't have any idea.
MAURICE	Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.

MAURICE	How do I look, mama?
MAID	Like a fag.

MAURICE	A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
MAID	The combination is three-ten-forty-four.

RAY	I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
MARSHALL	Likewise.

MARSHALL	In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
RAY	No.  Course not.

RAY	Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
MARSHALL	I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.

MARSHALL	Did you pay the guy the reward?
RAY	Yeah, as soon as we got back.

MARSHALL	...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
RAY	I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
MARSHALL	That's how you score now?

RAY	The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
MARSHALL	So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.

RIPLEY	Thank you...
MAURICE	Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
RIPLEY	What?
MAURICE	Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
RIPLEY	I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
MAURICE	Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.

MAURICE	That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
RIPLEY	Well, I need that...
MAURICE	...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.

MAURICE	Faux goose down.
RIPLEY	Still...

RIPLEY	Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
MAURICE	Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.

MAURICE	Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
RIPLEY	Are those <i>my</i> suits?
MAURICE	Where you been hiding, Dick?

RIPLEY	Midge.
MAURICE	Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
RIPLEY	Foley's got it.
MAURICE	Where the fuck is Foley?

WHITE BOY BOB	We have a problem here?
MAURICE	Jack Foley, famous bank robber.

MAURICE	White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
WHITE BOY BOB	Ten gees.
MAURICE	Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?

WHITE BOY BOB	I think he must've fell in.
MAURICE	I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.

WHITE BOY BOB	I found a rubber.
MAURICE	White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.

MAURICE	...the fuck is this...
WHITE BOY BOB	Are they dead?

BARNEY	Hello, Lilla!
ELIZABETH	Peggy Sue!

BARNEY	Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
ELIZABETH	I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?

BARNEY	What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
ELIZABETH	I'm not telling.
BARNEY	I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.

ELIZABETH	What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
BARNEY	It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.

PEGGY	Do you believe in all of that?
BARNEY	Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
PEGGY	I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.

BARNEY	It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
PEGGY	That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
BARNEY	It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
PEGGY	Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
BARNEY	I'd take better care of my teeth.

BARNEY	Let's go.
PEGGY	Goodbye, Grandma.

PEGGY	What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
BARNEY	Stag movies. Smokers.

BARNEY	I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
PEGGY	I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
BARNEY	The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.

PEGGY	Do you have to wear that hat?
BARNEY	It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.

BETH	Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
PEGGY	This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.

BETH	r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
PEGGY	How do you like my hair?
BETH	It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.

PEGGY	But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
BETH	Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
PEGGY	Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?

BETH	Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
PEGGY	Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
BETH	Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
PEGGY	Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.

PEGGY	I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
BETH	Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
PEGGY	I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.

PEGGY	Carol!
CAROL	Peggy Sue!

PEGGY	1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
CAROL	You're probably the only one who could carry it off.

CAROL	Welcome to the singles scene.
PEGGY	I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
CAROL	You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
PEGGY	We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
CAROL	So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.

CAROL	You should have left here years ago, like I did.
PEGGY	It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
CAROL	After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
PEGGY	Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
CAROL	Wouldn't we all.

PEGGY	Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
CAROL	Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...

CAROL	The only one?
PEGGY	Well, besides Charlie, of course.

CAROL	They're waiting. Come on.
PEGGY	I can't. It's all too much.
CAROL	Go on. You can do it.

PEGGY	Where is it?
CAROL	Were taking you back to the nurse.
PEGGY	Maddy, what did you do to your hair?

CAROL	We're going to take you home.
PEGGY	That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.

CAROL	I'll call you Later.
PEGGY	Yes. Let's stay in touch.

PEGGY	I don't get it.
CAROL	That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.

PEGGY	He is kind of cute, isn't he?
CAROL	Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
PEGGY	He does?

CAROL	All right. What's the scoop?
PEGGY	On what?

PEGGY	Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
CAROL	Just what you underlined.
PEGGY	You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
CAROL	Come on. What's with you and Michael?

CAROL	I bet Dolores told Charlie.
PEGGY	That loudmouthed little bitch~

PEGGY	Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
CAROL	Aren't we a little old for that?

PEGGY	What's the matter?
CAROL	It's that jerk Walter.
PEGGY	What happened?
CAROL	After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
PEGGY	Welcome to the singles' scene.
CAROL	What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
PEGGY	Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.

CAROL	Lucky lady. Hi.
MADDY	Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?

MADDY	Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
CAROL	Why do guys do such stupid things?

CAROL	Charlie really has a great voice.
MADDY	Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.

CAROL	I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
MADDY	That's disgusting!
CAROL	) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eightysix.

MADDY	Peggy Sue!
CAROL	You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.

CAROL	Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
MADDY	Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.

CHARLIE	And we're here on the couch...
PEGGY	Don't say that...

CHARLIE	We're here on the sofa bed...
PEGGY	Charlie...
CHARLIE	...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.

CHARLIE	Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
PEGGY	I can't. I'm too embarrassed.

CHARLIE	But you love me don't you?
PEGGY	Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
CHARLIE	And nothing will ever change that.

PEGGY	There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
CHARLIE	Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
PEGGY	I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
CHARLIE	I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
PEGGY	Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
CHARLIE	Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.

CHARLIE	You got a Tab?
PEGGY	I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.

CHARLIE	You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
PEGGY	I know. Put Scott through college.
CHARLIE	I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.

PEGGY	Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
CHARLIE	I'm not going.

CHARLIE	I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
PEGGY	Charlie! Am I dead?
CHARLIE	No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.

CHARLIE	How do you feel?
PEGGY	Pretty strange.

PEGGY	Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
CHARLIE	Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.

PEGGY	You drive like a maniac!
CHARLIE	I call this the staccato. 
CHARLIE	Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
PEGGY	Oh yeah?
CHARLIE	You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
PEGGY	Refresh my memory.
CHARLIE	How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
PEGGY	Maybe I blocked it out.
CHARLIE	I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.

CHARLIE	It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
PEGGY	Why wait?
CHARLIE	Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
PEGGY	They'll learn to live with it.

CHARLIE	Want me to drive you home later?
PEGGY	Would you?
CHARLIE	Would I?!! Why I oughta...

CHARLIE	Looking good out there.
PEGGY	Thanks.
CHARLIE	I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
PEGGY	I thought it had a lot of merit.
CHARLIE	In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
PEGGY	Rejected, worthless, miserable.
CHARLIE	Yeah. Like that.
PEGGY	Good.

PEGGY	Where did you get that sweater?
CHARLIE	Great, isn't it?
PEGGY	It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
CHARLIE	Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
PEGGY	Right. I promised my mother.
CHARLIE	Is this slow enough for you?
PEGGY	Charlie, how are you?
CHARLIE	I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
PEGGY	Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?

PEGGY	Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
CHARLIE	Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
PEGGY	He's trying.
CHARLIE	Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
PEGGY	Come on, let's dance.

CHARLIE	There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
PEGGY	You're pretty charming when you want to be.
CHARLIE	Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.

PEGGY	Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
CHARLIE	Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
PEGGY	You really love me, don't you?
CHARLIE	You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
PEGGY	Charlie, let's make love.
CHARLIE	What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
PEGGY	A lot's happened since last weekend.
CHARLIE	But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
PEGGY	I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
CHARLIE	Who?

PEGGY	You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
CHARLIE	You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.

PEGGY	This is a mistake. We better forget it.
CHARLIE	You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.

PEGGY	I'm sorry Charlie.
CHARLIE	Save it.

PEGGY	What do you know about classical music?
CHARLIE	Nothing.. Selling is selling.
PEGGY	Charlie. About last nights..
CHARLIE	Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
PEGGY	But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
CHARLIE	Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
PEGGY	Why?

CHARLIE	Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
PEGGY	What am I going to do with you?
CHARLIE	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.

PEGGY	Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
CHARLIE	I have to talk to you..

PEGGY	What are you doing here?
CHARLIE	Let's go down to the basement.

CHARLIE	I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
PEGGY	I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
CHARLIE	Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
PEGGY	You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
CHARLIE	You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
PEGGY	And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
CHARLIE	Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
PEGGY	Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
CHARLIE	I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
PEGGY	That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
CHARLIE	What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
PEGGY	I just can't trust you anymore.
CHARLIE	What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
PEGGY	That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
CHARLIE	But what has to be different?
PEGGY	Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
CHARLIE	What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
PEGGY	I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
CHARLIE	You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!

CHARLIE	What're you doing here?
PEGGY	I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
CHARLIE	Rusty's dead. That's Ajax

PEGGY	Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
CHARLIE	Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
PEGGY	Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
CHARLIE	How'd you know about that?
PEGGY	I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
CHARLIE	Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
PEGGY	What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
CHARLIE	Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.

PEGGY	I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
CHARLIE	That's real big of you.
PEGGY	Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
CHARLIE	You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?

PEGGY	Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
CHARLIE	Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
PEGGY	Just take a look at it. 
CHARLIE	If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?

CHARLIE	Does this mean you like me again?
PEGGY	It means I care about you and what happens to you.
CHARLIE	That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.

PEGGY	Forget it, it'll never work.
CHARLIE	Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.

PEGGY	What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
CHARLIE	I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
PEGGY	Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
CHARLIE	You're going to listen to me.

PEGGY	Let me got! Where are you taking me?
CHARLIE	Right here. Now sit down.

CHARLIE	Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
PEGGY	How could you possibly know what I've been going through?

PEGGY	What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
CHARLIE	What?
PEGGY	You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
CHARLIE	You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
PEGGY	I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.

PEGGY	Will you take me back to my grandparents?
CHARLIE	Of course.

PEGGY	Oh, Charlie.
CHARLIE	It opens, too. Look inside.

CHARLIE	I love you.
PEGGY	I know.

CHARLIE	I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
PEGGY	Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
CHARLIE	What the hell is that?

CHARLIE	Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
PEGGY	I've got to go now.
CHARLIE	But I love you. I'll love you forever.
PEGGY	I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
CHARLIE	Come back to me.
PEGGY	I'm trying.

CHARLIE	. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
PEGGY	Charlie? Was I dead?
CHARLIE	I thought you were...for a while.
PEGGY	You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
CHARLIE	But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
PEGGY	Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
CHARLIE	I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
PEGGY	What about Janet?
CHARLIE	That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.

PEGGY	It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
CHARLIE	I'll just set it right here.

PEGGY	Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
CHARLIE	Oh, God, Dion.
PEGGY	You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
CHARLIE	I'll never give up.
PEGGY	Then hold me.

CHARLIE	I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
PEGGY	Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
CHARLIE	Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...

MR. KELCHER	Hello, Charlie.
CHARLIE	Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
MR. KELCHER	Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.

CHARLIE	Yes, sir.
MR. KELCHER	She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.

CHARLIE	Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
MR. KELCHER	Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
CHARLIE	Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.

MR. KELCHER	We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
CHARLIE	What would that be, sir?
MR. KELCHER	Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
CHARLIE	Of course.

DOLORES	Did you study for the test?
PEGGY	Test?

DOLORES	Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
PEGGY	First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
DOLORES	God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
PEGGY	Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
DOLORES	Are you for real?
PEGGY	Touchy, touchy!

PEGGY	Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
DOLORES	Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
PEGGY	I beg your pardon?
DOLORES	Take a long walk on a short pier.
PEGGY	Have a nice day.

DOLORES	Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
TERRY	What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?

DOLORES	Terry, slow down.
TERRY	Okay.
DOLORES	Terry! Slow down.
TERRY	What, why?

DOLORES	There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
TERRY	That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
DOLORES	First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.

PEGGY	Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
ELIZABETH	That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.

ELIZABETH	You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
PEGGY	I wish she hadn't.
ELIZABETH	I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.

ELIZABETH	If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
PEGGY	But I'm remembering the future.
ELIZABETH	Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
PEGGY	My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.

PEGGY	It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
ELIZABETH	He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.

PEGGY	It was Beth's idea.
MADDY	I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.

PEGGY	Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
MADDY	It must run in the family.

PEGGY	Don't get your hopes up.
MADDY	Come on, where's your enthusiasm?

MADDY	How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
PEGGY	She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?

MADDY	Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
PEGGY	He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.

PEGGY	Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
MADDY	But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
PEGGY	I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.

PEGGY	I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
MICHAEL	Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
PEGGY	You don't?
MICHAEL	He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
PEGGY	Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
MICHAEL	A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!

PEGGY	The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
MICHAEL	What're you doing here anyway?
PEGGY	Coffee and a donut.
MICHAEL	I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
PEGGY	Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.

MICHAEL	This is great reefer.
PEGGY	Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
MICHAEL	The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
PEGGY	What are you shooting for?
MICHAEL	Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
PEGGY	Don't you get along with your parents?
MICHAEL	The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
PEGGY	They care about you. They're just a different generation.
MICHAEL	Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
PEGGY	I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.

MICHAEL	A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
PEGGY	Is that one of your poems?
MICHAEL	No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
PEGGY	I'd love to.
MICHAEL	Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 

MICHAEL	That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
PEGGY	I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.

MICHAEL	Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
PEGGY	For everyone.
MICHAEL	Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
PEGGY	Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
MICHAEL	Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
PEGGY	I can't do that.
MICHAEL	Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
PEGGY	I hate chickens.

MICHAEL	But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
PEGGY	Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
MICHAEL	But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
PEGGY	That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
MICHAEL	You think so?
PEGGY	Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
MICHAEL	I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.

PEGGY	It's Charlie!
MICHAEL	What a treat.

PEGGY	Ssh. He's great.
MICHAEL	Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.

PEGGY	I thought I knew everything about him.
MICHAEL	Can we split now?

MICHAEL	I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
PEGGY	What?
MICHAEL	My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.

MR. KELCHER	Young lady, you're drunk!
PEGGY	Just a little. I've had a tough day.
MR. KELCHER	I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
PEGGY	Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.

PEGGY	Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
MR. KELCHER	Evelyn, put her to bed.

MR. KELCHER	Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
PEGGY	That would be impossible.
MR. KELCHER	You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
PEGGY	Mom, is there any coffee left?

MR. KELCHER	If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
PEGGY	I think I'm way ahead of them.

MR. KELCHER	Damn that Charlie I
PEGGY	It's not Charlie. It's me.
MR. KELCHER	Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
PEGGY	At my age? Don't be silly.
MR. KELCHER	Thank God for that.
PEGGY	Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
MR. KELCHER	Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
PEGGY	Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
MR. KELCHER	All right. But this better be good.
PEGGY	I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
MR. KELCHER	Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
PEGGY	I think they're going to deregulate it.
MR. KELCHER	That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
PEGGY	Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
MR. KELCHER	I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
PEGGY	Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
MR. KELCHER	Evelyn, take her to her room!

PEGGY	Hi, Dad.
MR. KELCHER	Doing some shopping?

MR. KELCHER	For me?
PEGGY	Open it.

PEGGY	I closed my Christmas club.
MR. KELCHER	Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
PEGGY	I wanted to apologize for this morning.
MR. KELCHER	It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
PEGGY	Quiet today?
MR. KELCHER	This morning was good.
PEGGY	The hat business is in trouble.
MR. KELCHER	I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
PEGGY	Yes.
MR. KELCHER	That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
PEGGY	But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
MR. KELCHER	Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
PEGGY	He'll win.
MR. KELCHER	Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.

PEGGY	Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
MR. KELCHER	This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?

MR. KELCHER	That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
PEGGY	You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.

MR. KELCHER	You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
PEGGY	Wrong, Dad. Your idea.

PEGGY	How did it go with the pantyhose?
MR. KELCHER	It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
PEGGY	Oh no!
MR. KELCHER	Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?

PEGGY	Oh, you're both so naive.
MR. KELCHER	Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!

MRS. KELCHER	Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
MR. KELCHER	This is not giving blood. This is drunk.

MRS. KELCHER	A new car. We can't afford a new car.
MR. KELCHER	Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
MRS. KELCHER	You have four seasons, you have four slumps.

MR. KELCHER	I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
MRS. KELCHER	Please don't shout.

MRS. KELCHER	Does everybody have to hear?
MR. KELCHER	I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.

MRS. KELCHER	Jack, I was just trying to help.
MR. KELCHER	We'll make it, we'll be fine.

MR. KELCHER	Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
MRS. KELCHER	Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.

PEGGY	Mom!
MRS. KELCHER	The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.

PEGGY	I have a note.
MRS. KELCHER	How do you feel?
PEGGY	I'm excused.
MRS. KELCHER	Why don't you go lie down for a while.
PEGGY	Mom!

PEGGY	Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
MRS. KELCHER	Of course, dear. You're home now.
PEGGY	I'm home now.

MRS. KELCHER	My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
PEGGY	Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.

MRS. KELCHER	What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
PEGGY	Oh. I forgot.

MRS. KELCHER	You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
PEGGY	I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.

MRS. KELCHER	When did you start drinking coffee?

PEGGY	Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
MRS. KELCHER	What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
PEGGY	Sort of.
MRS. KELCHER	What about?
PEGGY	The house payments.

PEGGY	Who was that man?
MRS. KELCHER	It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
PEGGY	It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.

MRS. KELCHER	Would you get that, dear?
PEGGY	Sure, Mom.  Hello.

MRS. KELCHER	Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
PEGGY	It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.

MRS. KELCHER	What happened to you?
PEGGY	I had a dream that Grandma died.
MRS. KELCHER	Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
PEGGY	She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
MRS. KELCHER	Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
PEGGY	I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
MRS. KELCHER	That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
PEGGY	I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.

MRS. KELCHER	Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
PEGGY	What do you mean?
MRS. KELCHER	Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.

MRS. KELCHER	Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
PEGGY	For what?
MRS. KELCHER	Maddy's party.
PEGGY	I don't feel very festive.
MRS. KELCHER	You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.

MRS. KELCHER	Where have you been?
PEGGY	I went for a drive. Up in the hills.

MRS. KELCHER	I'm not the maid!
PEGGY	Way to go, Mom!

MRS. KELCHER	Would they go over my girdle or under?
PEGGY	Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.

MRS. KELCHER	Isn't that awfully forward?
PEGGY	We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.

MRS. KELCHER	You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
PEGGY	Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?

PEGGY	No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
MRS. KELCHER	What does Charlie think about that?
PEGGY	You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
MRS. KELCHER	What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
PEGGY	Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?

MRS. KELCHER	Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
PEGGY	He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.

NANCY	What are you doing?
PEGGY	I'm just happy to see you.
NANCY	Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
PEGGY	I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
NANCY	Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
PEGGY	Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
NANCY	Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?

PEGGY	It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
NANCY	Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
PEGGY	Don't eat the red ones.
NANCY	Why not? They're my favorite.
PEGGY	They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. 

NANCY	And the butter.
PEGGY	You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.

PEGGY	Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
NANCY	Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?

NANCY	You think this'll cheer Dad up?
PEGGY	Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.

ROSALIE	I remember that dress.
PEGGY	Rosalie Testa!

ROSALIE	I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
PEGGY	You have an incredible memory.

ROSALIE	What's up?
PEGGY	I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
ROSALIE	Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
PEGGY	I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
ROSALIE	I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
PEGGY	But accidents can happen.
ROSALIE	Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
PEGGY	Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
ROSALIE	You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.

RICHARD	Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
PEGGY	I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
RICHARD	You look exactly the same.
PEGGY	I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.

PEGGY	Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
RICHARD	Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
PEGGY	He's not here. We're getting divorced.
RICHARD	Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.

RICHARD	The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
PEGGY	Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
RICHARD	You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
PEGGY	What was?
RICHARD	Dancing with you.
PEGGY	You're a sweet man, Richard.
RICHARD	I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
PEGGY	You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.

PEGGY	Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
RICHARD	It really wasn't that difficult.

PEGGY	I have to talk to you. It's very important.
RICHARD	I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
PEGGY	It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
RICHARD	All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.

PEGGY	What a great kite.
RICHARD	I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
PEGGY	I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
RICHARD	Are you doing some kind of science project?
PEGGY	Sort of.
RICHARD	Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.

RICHARD	And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
PEGGY	What's that?
RICHARD	That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
RICHARD	Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
PEGGY	What's inside?
RICHARD	You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
PEGGY	So you think time travel is possible? For people?
RICHARD	Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
PEGGY	Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
RICHARD	Okay. I promise.
PEGGY	This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
RICHARD	You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.

PEGGY	You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
RICHARD	How, did you know about my grandfather?
PEGGY	Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
RICHARD	Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!

RICHARD	But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
PEGGY	I don't know.

RICHARD	I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
PEGGY	That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
RICHARD	You look pretty good for a corpse.
PEGGY	Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
RICHARD	You're giving me the creeps.
PEGGY	Am I dead or not?
RICHARD	There's one way to find out.

PEGGY	What're you doing?
RICHARD	Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.

RICHARD	Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
PEGGY	What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?

RICHARD	You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
PEGGY	I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
RICHARD	All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
PEGGY	I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
RICHARD	What if you're not here tomorrow?

RICHARD	The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
PEGGY	I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
RICHARD	But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
PEGGY	I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
RICHARD	I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
PEGGY	Richard, take it easy.
RICHARD	No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
PEGGY	How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
RICHARD	I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
PEGGY	Give me some credit, will you?
RICHARD	Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
PEGGY	Wbat're you talking about?
RICHARD	Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
PEGGY	Sixtyforty.

RICHARD	You're taking advantage of a minor.
PEGGY	When do we start?

PEGGY	Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
RICHARD	Come on. You can't be serious.
PEGGY	There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
RICHARD	Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
PEGGY	Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.

PEGGY	You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
RICHARD	All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.

PEGGY	Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
RICHARD	What are you talking about?
PEGGY	The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
RICHARD	High tech. I like the sound of that.

PEGGY	Hi, Richard.
RICHARD	What are you doing?
PEGGY	Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
RICHARD	That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
PEGGY	Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
RICHARD	That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
PEGGY	It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
RICHARD	Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
PEGGY	For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
RICHARD	Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
PEGGY	Like what?
RICHARD	Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
PEGGY	What do you know about hypnosis?
RICHARD	Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
PEGGY	Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
RICHARD	No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.

RICHARD	You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
PEGGY	Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
RICHARD	Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
PEGGY	Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
RICHARD	What will they be made of?
PEGGY	I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
RICHARD	Silicon is from sand.
PEGGY	We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...

RICHARD	In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
PEGGY	No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
RICHARD	You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
PEGGY	No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
RICHARD	Will you take of f your blouse?
PEGGY	Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.

RICHARD	No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
PEGGY	I couldn't help it  I loved him.
RICHARD	One... two... three.  You are now awake.

PEGGY	Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
RICHARD	Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
PEGGY	That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
RICHARD	I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
PEGGY	God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?

RICHARD	Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
PEGGY	Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.

RICHARD	What's the matter?
PEGGY	It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
RICHARD	Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
PEGGY	You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.

PEGGY	I came to say goodbye.
RICHARD	Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
PEGGY	You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
RICHARD	So are you. You've got a vision.
PEGGY	Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
RICHARD	Did you break up with Charlie?
PEGGY	Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
RICHARD	Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
PEGGY	No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
RICHARD	Wait! I'll go with you!
PEGGY	You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.

VIVIAN	Georgia.
BRIDGET	No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
VIVIAN	Well... I might be going out to dinner.
BRIDGET	You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
VIVIAN	I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
BRIDGET	Philip!  We'll need shoes!

BRIDGET	Your uncle will like this.
VIVIAN	He's not really my uncle.
BRIDGET	They never are, dear.

DAVID	Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
EDWARD	Twenty-five percent.

DAVID	We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
EDWARD	You're not getting any navy contracts.

DAVID	There's no way you could know that.
EDWARD	But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.

EDWARD	We can reach an understanding on this.
DAVID	I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
EDWARD	Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
DAVID	I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.

DAVID	I like your hat.
VIVIAN	Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
DAVID	Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
VIVIAN	Please, we hardly know each other.
DAVID	Thunder's a horse.  Come on.

DAVID	Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
VIVIAN	No.
DAVID	Hope to be?

VIVIAN	It's... it's not like that.
DAVID	I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.

VIVIAN	You don't know anything about me.
DAVID	I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.

EDWARD	What's that long building over there?
JAKE	Storage, I think.
EDWARD	Not with those smokestacks it's not.

JAKE	The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
EDWARD	You what?
JAKE	I talked to some developers about the land.

JAKE	Congratulations, sir.
EDWARD	What?
JAKE	Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.

JAKE	Who are you going after next, sir?
EDWARD	Who indeed...

KROSS	What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
EDWARD	To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.

EDWARD	Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
KROSS	You've got a lot of nerve.
EDWARD	No.  What I have is a lot of money.
KROSS	I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
EDWARD	What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
KROSS	I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
EDWARD	It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.

KROSS	Mr. Harris.
EDWARD	How are you, Mr. Kross.
KROSS	Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.

KROSS	Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
EDWARD	<u>Expected</u>... offer.
KROSS	Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
EDWARD	You're making the right decision, sir.

EDWARD	Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
KROSS	Yes.
EDWARD	If you had a... reprieve, what would do?

KROSS	I... I would take advantage of it.
EDWARD	How?

KROSS	I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
EDWARD	I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.

KROSS	Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
EDWARD	This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
KROSS	You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
EDWARD	You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.

VIVIAN	Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
EDWARD	What's that?
VIVIAN	You looking' for some company?
EDWARD	Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
VIVIAN	What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
EDWARD	Yes.
VIVIAN	Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?

EDWARD	No, you look like a hooker.
VIVIAN	Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
EDWARD	Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
VIVIAN	Sure.  For five bucks.
EDWARD	That's ridiculous.
VIVIAN	The price just went up to ten.
EDWARD	Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
VIVIAN	Sit... and spin.
EDWARD	Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?

VIVIAN	Nice car.  Yours?
EDWARD	No.
VIVIAN	Stolen?
EDWARD	Not exactly.

VIVIAN	Mind if I turn on some heat?
EDWARD	If you can figure it out, be my guest.

EDWARD	Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
VIVIAN	You're not from L.A., huh?
EDWARD	New York.
VIVIAN	What motel you staying at?
EDWARD	<u>Ho</u>tel.
VIVIAN	Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
EDWARD	Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
VIVIAN	Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.

EDWARD	What's your name?
VIVIAN	What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
EDWARD	You like being a hooker, Vivian?
VIVIAN	It pays.
EDWARD	So do day jobs.
VIVIAN	Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.

EDWARD	Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
VIVIAN	Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
EDWARD	Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
VIVIAN	If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
EDWARD	Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.

EDWARD	Ugly habit, biting your nails.
VIVIAN	You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.

EDWARD	What do you charge for company, Vivian?
VIVIAN	Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
EDWARD	For the whole night?
VIVIAN	For an hour.
EDWARD	You're joking.
VIVIAN	I never joke about money.
EDWARD	Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.

VIVIAN	No, but it's getting there.
EDWARD	Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
VIVIAN	You couldn't afford it.

VIVIAN	Three hundred.
EDWARD	Fine.
VIVIAN	What's your name, lover.
EDWARD	Edward.  My name is Edward.
VIVIAN	Edward... you got it!

EDWARD	Get in.  This side.
VIVIAN	What?
EDWARD	You know how to drive a stick?

VIVIAN	Better believe it.
EDWARD	Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.

EDWARD	My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
VIVIAN	Why?
EDWARD	You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
VIVIAN	You mean they don't have hookers.
EDWARD	Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
VIVIAN	Off the boulevard.
EDWARD	Exactly.

EDWARD	Room service.  What do you drink?
VIVIAN	Diet coke.
EDWARD	Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
VIVIAN	Can I have some chips?
EDWARD	-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.

EDWARD	Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
VIVIAN	Do you plan everything?
EDWARD	Always.
VIVIAN	Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
EDWARD	Fair enough.

EDWARD	Let's talk some more first.
VIVIAN	Right.  So!  In town on business?
EDWARD	Uh-huh.
VIVIAN	Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
EDWARD	And why do you say that?
VIVIAN	I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.

EDWARD	Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
VIVIAN	I've known a lot of everybody.

EDWARD	I think he wanted you to tip him.
VIVIAN	Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.

VIVIAN	Where are they?  Shopping together?
EDWARD	They should be.  They're both good at it.

EDWARD	It's a very good year.
VIVIAN	Oooh, thank god.

EDWARD	Try a strawberry.
VIVIAN	Why?
EDWARD	Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
VIVIAN	Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
EDWARD	Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.

EDWARD	You really are a very beautiful girl.
VIVIAN	Just a romantic, that's you.
EDWARD	Yes...

EDWARD	What do you like?
VIVIAN	If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.

EDWARD	Good morning.
VIVIAN	You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
EDWARD	No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?

EDWARD	Did you sleep well?
VIVIAN	Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
EDWARD	Occupational hazard?

VIVIAN	Where'd you go?
EDWARD	I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
VIVIAN	Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
EDWARD	Mmm, I could tell.
VIVIAN	I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
EDWARD	I'd say you give a good dollar value.

EDWARD	Do you ever... enjoy it?
VIVIAN	I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
EDWARD	No?  Why's that?
VIVIAN	Occupational hazard.

EDWARD	I buy companies.
VIVIAN	No shit.  They expensive?

EDWARD	The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
VIVIAN	... dollars?

VIVIAN	So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
EDWARD	I sell them.
VIVIAN	What?  Why?

EDWARD	By breaking up a company's assets --
VIVIAN	What are assets?
EDWARD	Vivian --
VIVIAN	C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
EDWARD	Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
VIVIAN	Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
EDWARD	Not... quite.
VIVIAN	There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
EDWARD	Where'd you learn to do this?
VIVIAN	I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
EDWARD	Don't drown.

EDWARD	All right.  How much for the week?
VIVIAN	What?
EDWARD	I'm in town until Saturday.

VIVIAN	It'd cost you.
EDWARD	Of course.  How much?
VIVIAN	Five full nights... days too?

VIVIAN	Four thousand.
EDWARD	Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
VIVIAN	But you want days too.
EDWARD	All right, two thousand.
VIVIAN	Three.
EDWARD	Done.
VIVIAN	Holy shit.

EDWARD	I'm not just talking about sex.
VIVIAN	Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
EDWARD	Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.

EDWARD	Never answer the phone.  Ever.
VIVIAN	Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
EDWARD	Did you buy some clothes?
VIVIAN	I got a dress, yeah.
EDWARD	Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
VIVIAN	It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
EDWARD	Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
VIVIAN	No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
EDWARD	This isn't a date.
VIVIAN	Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
EDWARD	The Rex.
VIVIAN	Any good?
EDWARD	I think you'll approve.
VIVIAN	... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
EDWARD	Thank you <u>very much</u>.

VIVIAN	Hello?
EDWARD	I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
VIVIAN	Oooh!

EDWARD	I'm sorry.
VIVIAN	You're forgiven.

EDWARD	And that's the way the game is played.
VIVIAN	Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.

VIVIAN	You're upset, huh?
EDWARD	Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
VIVIAN	You liked the guy, though.
EDWARD	Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
VIVIAN	We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...

VIVIAN	Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
EDWARD	Television?
VIVIAN	Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
EDWARD	I have work to do.
VIVIAN	Uh-uh.  No work.

EDWARD	I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
VIVIAN	I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
EDWARD	Why not?
VIVIAN	Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
EDWARD	Was someone rude to you?
VIVIAN	I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
EDWARD	Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.

VIVIAN	Okay.
EDWARD	Good.
VIVIAN	Come with me?

VIVIAN	I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
EDWARD	Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
VIVIAN	Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
EDWARD	Please.

VIVIAN	What about dinner?
EDWARD	Dinner can wait.

VIVIAN	You always been rich?
EDWARD	No.
VIVIAN	Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
EDWARD	Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.

VIVIAN	Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
EDWARD	Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.

VIVIAN	You still mad at'm?
EDWARD	He died a long time ago.

VIVIAN	You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
EDWARD	I think it's exciting.
VIVIAN	What id we run into someone I know?
EDWARD	I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
VIVIAN	You did.

VIVIAN	Real genuine guy.
EDWARD	He's good at what he does.
VIVIAN	You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
EDWARD	Shall we mingle?

VIVIAN	Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
EDWARD	I'm sure that's true for some of them.
VIVIAN	I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
EDWARD	Ready to stomp sod?

VIVIAN	You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
EDWARD	Vivian, what the --

VIVIAN	Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
EDWARD	I don't know what you're talking about.
VIVIAN	I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
EDWARD	Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
VIVIAN	Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?

EDWARD	What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
VIVIAN	I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
EDWARD	Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
VIVIAN	Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.

VIVIAN	Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
EDWARD	Vivian...
VIVIAN	Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
EDWARD	Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
VIVIAN	Fuck off.
EDWARD	I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.

EDWARD	Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
VIVIAN	I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
EDWARD	I really am sorry.

VIVIAN	Do I look okay?
EDWARD	Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.

VIVIAN	What's that?
EDWARD	I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...

VIVIAN	Edward, I can't.
EDWARD	Shush.  Of course you can.
VIVIAN	What if I lose it?
EDWARD	You won't.
VIVIAN	What if someone tries to steal it?
EDWARD	I'll guard them and you with my life.

EDWARD	You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
VIVIAN	Where are you taking me!?
EDWARD	To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
VIVIAN	Huh?
EDWARD	The opera.

VIVIAN	I've never been on a plane before.
EDWARD	I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.

VIVIAN	Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
EDWARD	Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
VIVIAN	You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
EDWARD	What happened to him?

VIVIAN	If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
EDWARD	I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
VIVIAN	But don't they have it in English?
EDWARD	Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.

EDWARD	If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
VIVIAN	I more than liked it.
EDWARD	I know.  I'm glad.
VIVIAN	Did you?
EDWARD	Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.

EDWARD	One more night and you're finally rid of me.
VIVIAN	Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
EDWARD	I have to go to New York tomorrow.

VIVIAN	What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
EDWARD	It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
VIVIAN	I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...

EDWARD	Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
VIVIAN	When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."

EDWARD	Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
VIVIAN	I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
EDWARD	I've never treated you like a whore.
VIVIAN	You just did.

VIVIAN	What did you do to him?
EDWARD	What do you mean?
VIVIAN	Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
EDWARD	Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
VIVIAN	Right.
EDWARD	It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
VIVIAN	Business.
EDWARD	Yes.  The man made a business decision.
VIVIAN	It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
EDWARD	It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.

VIVIAN	Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
EDWARD	Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
VIVIAN	Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
EDWARD	It was a business decision.

EDWARD	I got tired of hating my father.
VIVIAN	It was good.
EDWARD	It felt good.

EDWARD	You're packing.
VIVIAN	I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.

VIVIAN	Aw, don't... no...
EDWARD	Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
VIVIAN	I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?

VIVIAN	I didn't think so.
EDWARD	Vivian...
VIVIAN	It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.

MR. THOMAS	Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
EDWARD	Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
MR. THOMAS	I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
EDWARD	My what?
MR. THOMAS	The young lady staying in your room?

MR. THOMAS	Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
EDWARD	Thank you.

MR. THOMAS	Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
EDWARD	Afternoon.

STUCKEY	What's up, where you going?
EDWARD	Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
STUCKEY	At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
EDWARD	Apologize to Elizabeth for me.

STUCKEY	Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
EDWARD	Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
STUCKEY	Cynthia's not coming?
EDWARD	No.

EDWARD	Love this car!  Is it new?
STUCKEY	Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!

EDWARD	I want to.
STUCKEY	Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
EDWARD	I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
STUCKEY	You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
EDWARD	Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
STUCKEY	Oh, god, what?
EDWARD	I'll bring it back.

STUCKEY	Edward, did you hear me?
EDWARD	I'm here.
STUCKEY	I know a lot of nice girls.

STUCKEY	What!?
EDWARD	We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?

EDWARD	What time's diner tonight?
STUCKEY	Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
EDWARD	No one you know.

STUCKEY	Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
EDWARD	Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
STUCKEY	Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.

EDWARD	Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
STUCKEY	We're letting them slide?
EDWARD	I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
STUCKEY	But, Edward...
EDWARD	Do it.

STUCKEY	Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
EDWARD	Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
STUCKEY	And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed.

EDWARD	Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
STUCKEY	Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.

STUCKEY	Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
EDWARD	We just did.
STUCKEY	Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
EDWARD	The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
STUCKEY	And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
EDWARD	Yes...
STUCKEY	Doing what?
EDWARD	Vivian's in sales.
STUCKEY	Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?

EDWARD	Why do you want to know?
STUCKEY	Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.

EDWARD	She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
STUCKEY	So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
EDWARD	You're being ridiculous.
STUCKEY	Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
EDWARD	Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.

STUCKEY	This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
EDWARD	Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
STUCKEY	Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
EDWARD	Goodbye, Bill.

STUCKEY	Did I wake you?
EDWARD	I'm up.
STUCKEY	I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
EDWARD	Why?
STUCKEY	He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
EDWARD	Give me twenty minutes.
STUCKEY	We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.

STUCKEY	I don't think there's any sense in --
EDWARD	Let him answer.

STUCKEY	Oh, my god... Edward, no!
EDWARD	I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
STUCKEY	Have you lost your mind?

STUCKEY	What!?
EDWARD	Have a good day, gentlemen.

STUCKEY	You broke my nose.
EDWARD	I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
STUCKEY	Edward, we've been together ten years.
EDWARD	And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
STUCKEY	All this because of that whore!
EDWARD	Yes.

VIVIAN	You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
KIT	Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.

KIT	Carlos had some great rock.
VIVIAN	I bet.  That was our rent!

VIVIAN	We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
KIT	Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.

VIVIAN	I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
KIT	Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
VIVIAN	I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
KIT	I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
VIVIAN	No, let's go to work.  Okay?
KIT	Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.

VIVIAN	Looks slow tonight.
KIT	Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
VIVIAN	Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.

KIT	I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
VIVIAN	That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
KIT	Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
VIVIAN	He's not gonna want us.

KIT	'Lo.
VIVIAN	Kit!  Where've you been?
KIT	I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
VIVIAN	Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
KIT	Why'd he want you?

VIVIAN	He... he just does.
KIT	I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
VIVIAN	Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
KIT	I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
VIVIAN	Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
KIT	In Beverly Hills?
VIVIAN	Yeah.
KIT	Baby!  Rodeo Drive.

VIVIAN	Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
KIT	Was that you?
VIVIAN	Who did you think?
KIT	Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
VIVIAN	Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
KIT	Yeah.  I just got it.

VIVIAN	Kit...
KIT	Everybody keeps starin' at me.
VIVIAN	Yeah... I know what you mean.
KIT	What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
VIVIAN	You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
KIT	Where do you fit?

VIVIAN	I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
KIT	Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
VIVIAN	I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
KIT	Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
VIVIAN	It was great.
KIT	Dummy.
VIVIAN	He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
KIT	I pray for that.
VIVIAN	All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
KIT	Go for the bucks.
VIVIAN	I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
KIT	Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.

KIT	So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
VIVIAN	Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
KIT	What kind of school?
VIVIAN	School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
KIT	So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.

VIVIAN	Want a pair of boots?
KIT	Do I!?  Momma!

VIVIAN	You sure you won't come with me?
KIT	And leave all this?  Not in a million.

VIVIAN	Couple a hours.
KIT	Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
VIVIAN	Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
KIT	No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
VIVIAN	I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
KIT	I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.

VIVIAN	Yeah, what?
LANDLORD	Rent.  You're late.
VIVIAN	Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
LANDLORD	Kit give me nothin'.
VIVIAN	You bullshittin' me?
LANDLORD	Of rent I do not bullshit.

MAID	Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
VIVIAN	What?

MAID	<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
VIVIAN	Okay.

VIVIAN	Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
MAID	I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
VIVIAN	Oooh, I love those.
MAID	I leave extras, miss.
VIVIAN	Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?

VIVIAN	I'm just going to my room.
MR. THOMAS	You're a guest here?
VIVIAN	I'm -- I'm with a friend.
MR. THOMAS	And who is that?
VIVIAN	I... Edward...

MR. THOMAS	What's your name?
VIVIAN	Vivian.
MR. THOMAS	Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

VIVIAN	Niece?
MR. THOMAS	Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.

VIVIAN	I got a dress.
MR. THOMAS	I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
VIVIAN	I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
MR. THOMAS	That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
VIVIAN	They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.

MR. THOMAS	What is it, Miss Vivian?
VIVIAN	Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
MR. THOMAS	It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
VIVIAN	Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
MR. THOMAS	I think you'll find it normal enough.
VIVIAN	Will I like it?
MR. THOMAS	You'll like it fine.
VIVIAN	Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.

MR. THOMAS	In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
VIVIAN	But I always eat like this.
MR. THOMAS	Either you're European or badly brought up.
VIVIAN	Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
MR. THOMAS	Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
VIVIAN	What if they serve soup?
MR. THOMAS	They will serve salad.
VIVIAN	But what if they serve soup?
MR. THOMAS	Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
VIVIAN	I like steak.
MR. THOMAS	Then you would use your--
VIVIAN	Steak spoon! 

MR. THOMAS	Miss Vivian --
VIVIAN	Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
MR. THOMAS	Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
VIVIAN	Professionally?

MR. THOMAS	Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
VIVIAN	Me?
MR. THOMAS	I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.

VIVIAN	Hi, Barney!
MR. THOMAS	Miss Vivian.
VIVIAN	Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
MR. THOMAS	Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
VIVIAN	Yeah, well, I check out today.
MR. THOMAS	You're not accompanying him to New York?
VIVIAN	Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
MR. THOMAS	Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.

SALESWOMAN	May I help you?
VIVIAN	I'm just looking, thanks.

SALESWOMAN	Are you looking for something in particular?
VIVIAN	Yes.  Something... conservative.
SALESWOMAN	Yes...

VIVIAN	You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
SALESWOMAN	I don't think it would fit you.
VIVIAN	I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
SALESWOMAN	It's very expensive.

VIVIAN	What is with you?
SALESWOMAN	Excuse me?
VIVIAN	I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
SALESWOMAN	I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.

SALESWOMAN	Would you like to try it on?
VIVIAN	'Scume me.

SALESWOMAN	Yes?
VIVIAN	Do you remember me?
SALESWOMAN	No, I'm sorry, I don't.
VIVIAN	I was in here yesterday.

STUCKEY	Having a good time, Vivian?
VIVIAN	Yeah.  Thanks.
STUCKEY	All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.

VIVIAN	What?
STUCKEY	It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.

VIVIAN	Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
STUCKEY	I just might do that.

STUCKEY	Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
VIVIAN	I think it's great.

STUCKEY	I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
VIVIAN	Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.

VIVIAN	Get out!
STUCKEY	Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?

FRANK	Do you have any tattoos Brad.
BRAD	Certainly not!
FRANK	Oh well.  How about you.  

BRAD	You!
FRANK	I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?

BRAD	Why you - what have you done with Janet?
FRANK	Nothing.  Why do you think I should?

BRAD	You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
FRANK	I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
BRAD	Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
FRANK	Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
BRAD	Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
FRANK	Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.

BRAD	You promise you won't tell?
FRANK	On my mother's grave.

FRANK	I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
BRAD	I told you, my car broke down.

BRAD	I was telling the truth.
FRANK	I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
BRAD	He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
FRANK	And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
BRAD	He might be.  I don't know.
FRANK	Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.

BRAD	Janet!
FRANK	Rocky!

BRAD	It's as if we were glued to the spot.
FRANK	You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.

BRAD	The future is ours so let's plan it.
FAMILY	Janet.
BRAD	So please don't tell me to can it.
FAMILY	Janet.
BRAD	I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.

FAMILY	Janet.
BRAD	Made me give you the eye And then panic,
FAMILY	Janet

JANET	Yes.
BRAD	Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
JANET	Yes.
BRAD	And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
JANET	Yes.

JANET	Yes Brad.
BRAD	I've got something to say.
JANET	Uh huh.
BRAD	I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
JANET	Oh Brad.

BRAD	Oh Janet
JANET	For you.

JANET	Oh Brad, I'm mad.
BRAD	Dammit, Janet.

JANET	Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
BRAD	Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.

BRAD	I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
JANET	Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
BRAD	Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.

JANET	What was that bang?
BRAD	We must have a blow-out.
JANET	Oh...

BRAD	You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
JANET	But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
BRAD	Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.

JANET	I'm coming with you.
BRAD	There's no point both of us getting wet.
JANET	I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.

JANET	Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
BRAD	Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.

JANET	Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
BRAD	Yes.

JANET	Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
BRAD	Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

JANET	Oh....Say something.
BRAD	Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?

JANET	Brad, please lets get out of here.
BRAD	For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
JANET	But it seems so unhealthy here.
BRAD	It's just a..a party Janet.
JANET	Well I want to leave.
BRAD	We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
JANET	Then ask the butler - or someone.
BRAD	Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
JANET	This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
BRAD	They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
JANET	Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
BRAD	I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.

JANET	Right!
BRAD	We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.

JANET	Oh Brad.
BRAD	It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.

BRAD	I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
JANET	Weiss.
BRAD	Weiss.

JANET	Brad...
BRAD	It's alright Janet.

JANET	Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
BRAD	It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
JANET	Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
BRAD	No, don't do that.
JANET	Oh don't be so shy.

JANET	Maybe we could try it this way.
BRAD	Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
JANET	I hope so my darling.

JANET	I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
BRAD	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.

JANET	I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
BRAD	So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
JANET	I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
BRAD	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
JANET	If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.

RIFF RAFF	Hello.
BRAD	Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
RIFF RAFF	You're wet.

BRAD	Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
RIFF RAFF	You know this earth - this person.
BRAD	I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.

BRAD	Good God.
RIFF RAFF	Yes.

DR SCOTT	Great Heavens, that's a laser.
RIFF RAFF	Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.

DR SCOTT	You did right.
RIFF RAFF	A decision had to be made.
DR SCOTT	You're OK by me.
RIFF RAFF	Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
DR SCOTT	Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
RIFF RAFF	You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.

JANET	Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
FRANK	I didn't make him for you

JANET	You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
FRANK	Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
JANET	You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
FRANK	I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.

FRANK	Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
JANET	Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
FRANK	Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.

JANET	Promise you won't tell Brad.
FRANK	Cross my heart and hope to die.

FRANK	What a guy
JANET	Makes you cry

FRANK	What guy
JANET	Makes you cry

GUESTS	Sweet Transvestite
FRANK	From Transexual Transylvania.

GUESTS	That ain't no crime

ROCKY	Oh, no no, no no.
GUESTS	Sha la la la That ain't no crime.

ROCKY	No no no no.
GUESTS	Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.

RIFF RAFF	I think you had better both come inside.
JANET	You're too kind.

JANET	Are you - giving a party?
RIFF RAFF	No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
JANET	Oh, lucky him.

RIFF RAFF	The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
JANET	Oh.

JANET	Who's Eddie?
RIFF RAFF	The delivery boy.

RIFF RAFF	Creature of the night.
MAGENTA	Creature of the night.

MAGENTA	I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
RIFF RAFF	They didn't like me.  They never liked me.

RIFF RAFF	Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
MAGENTA	Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
RIFF RAFF	But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
MAGENTA	And our World will do the Time Warp again.

CAPTAIN DIEL	Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
CARTER	Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
CAPTAIN DIEL	It's nine-thirty in the morning.
CARTER	Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
CAPTAIN DIEL	Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
CARTER	Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
CAPTAIN DIEL	I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
CARTER	Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
CAPTAIN DIEL	No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
CARTER	Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!

CARTER	What the hell is that?
CRAPS DEALER	Those are five hundred dollar chips.
CARTER	Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
CRAPS DEALER	No, I just assumed...
CARTER	You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
CRAPS DEALER	No, sir.
CARTER	Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?

CRAPS DEALER	Winner six!
CARTER	How much is that?
CRAPS DEALER	Two-hundred thousand!
CARTER	Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?

CRAPS DEALER	Winner!  Four, winner!
CARTER	I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!

DOORMAN #1	Invitation, please.
CARTER	I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
DOORMAN #1	The band has been playing over an hour.
CARTER	I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.

DOORMAN #1	Wait.
CARTER	Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
DOORMAN #1	Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.

KENNY	Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
CARTER	What??  Where'd you hear that?
KENNY	I got my sources.
CARTER	And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
KENNY	James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
CARTER	Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
KENNY	Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
CARTER	I'd like to see you try.

CARTER	Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
KENNY	Is this about the funny money?
CARTER	How'd you know?
KENNY	You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
CARTER	So tell me what you know.
KENNY	I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
CARTER	Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.

CARTER	What?
KENNY	One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.

KENNY	I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
CARTER	All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.

CARTER	How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
ISABELLA	Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
CARTER	San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
ISABELLA	I don't think so.
CARTER	I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
ISABELLA	This is your ship?
CARTER	That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
ISABELLA	El Capitan?
CARTER	I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
ISABELLA	Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
CARTER	Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
ISABELLA	The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
CARTER	Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
ISABELLA	I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
CARTER	Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.

ISABELLA	You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
CARTER	Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
ISABELLA	I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
CARTER	How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.

CARTER	Yeah, that's right.
ISABELLA	We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
ISABELLA	Look, I've been working this case for months now...
CARTER	So what's your story?
ISABELLA	They think I'm a crooked customs agent.

CARTER	It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
ISABELLA	It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
CARTER	How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
ISABELLA	In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.

ISABELLA	They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
CARTER	What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
ISABELLA	The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.

RICKY TAN	I'm busy at the moment.
CARTER	I said get on your feet!
RICKY TAN	I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
CARTER	I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!

CARTER	Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
RICKY TAN	I don't think so...

CARTER	I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
RICKY TAN	It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
CARTER	That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.

RICKY TAN	Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
CARTER	I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.

RICKY TAN	Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
CARTER	Lee, you okay?

RICKY TAN	Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
CARTER	C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.

HOSTESS	Oh, you American?
CARTER	That's right.
HOSTESS	You bring American money?
CARTER	Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.

HOSTESS	You get massage from Chinese girl before?
CARTER	No.  It's my first time.
HOSTESS	You pick any girl for you and your friend.

CARTER	Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
HOSTESS	Oh yes, she's very nice.
CARTER	She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.

CARTER	Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
STEVEN REIGN	I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.

CARTER	Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
STEVEN REIGN	Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
CARTER	Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
STEVEN REIGN	Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
CARTER	You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
STEVEN REIGN	You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.

CARTER	I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
LEE	That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
CARTER	Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
LEE	Those girls drove off because of you.
CARTER	All I did was invite them for a drink.
LEE	You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
CARTER	I said that?  Which word was "goat?"

LEE	You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
CARTER	Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
LEE	Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
CARTER	Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!

LEE	Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
CARTER	Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
LEE	Carter, would I lie to you?

CARTER	That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
LEE	No.
CARTER	You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.

CARTER	Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
LEE	No.
CARTER	Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.

LEE	I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
CARTER	Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
LEE	Bathroom.

LEE	Carter, get off that stage!
CARTER	Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!

LEE	This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
CARTER	I knew you were lying.
LEE	I'm sorry.
CARTER	Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
LEE	No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
CARTER	Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
LEE	Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
CARTER	Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
LEE	No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
CARTER	You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.

CARTER	What'd I say?
LEE	You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
CARTER	Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.

CARTER	All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
LEE	Try to land on your feet.

CARTER	You lied to me.
LEE	I'm sorry.
CARTER	You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
LEE	No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.

CARTER	I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
LEE	This won't take long.

CARTER	And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
LEE	Carter...you ready to have some fun!?

LEE	Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
CARTER	I am a tourist.

LEE	Hello.
CARTER	How you doin'?
LEE	My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.

LEE	What are you doing?
CARTER	She said I could pick any girl I want.
LEE	Well, hurry up.
CARTER	Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.

CARTER	What's wrong?
LEE	Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
CARTER	That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
LEE	This is a very dangerous man.
CARTER	I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
LEE	I'm calling for back up!

CARTER	Goddamn you got a small ass.
LEE	Don't look at my ass!

LEE	Where are you going?
CARTER	Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
LEE	Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
CARTER	Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
LEE	Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
CARTER	My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
LEE	It's my job!
CARTER	You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
LEE	I have plenty of dates.
CARTER	Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
LEE	You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
CARTER	And you ain't black!

LEE	Carter?
CARTER	Who died?
LEE	You.
CARTER	Detective Yu?  Never met him.
LEE	Not Yu.  You!
CARTER	Who?
LEE	Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
CARTER	Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.

CARTER	What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
LEE	I'm okay, you go.
CARTER	Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
LEE	Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
CARTER	What the hell is going on here?

CARTER	What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
LEE	I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
CARTER	Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
LEE	Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
CARTER	I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
LEE	No.  She's a school teacher.
CARTER	You're not very good at this, are you?
LEE	Good at what?
CARTER	Forget it.

LEE	Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
CARTER	Ask me if I give a shit.

LEE	He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
CARTER	How the hell did Tan get away with it?
LEE	All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
CARTER	This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?

LEE	No, no, that would be crazy --
CARTER	You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
LEE	I thought you'd think it was crazy.
CARTER	IT IS CRAZY!
LEE	I know.  I know.  I am sorry.

CARTER	So are you getting on the plane or not?!
LEE	What?
CARTER	Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
LEE	I cannot go to LA...

CARTER	It sounds impossible --
LEE	You said --
CARTER	-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.

CARTER	You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
LEE	Why LA?
CARTER	I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.

LEE	I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
CARTER	Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
LEE	Follow the Rich White Man?
CARTER	Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
LEE	Follow the RichWhiteMan...
CARTER	Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
LEE	Who?
CARTER	Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
LEE	How do you know he's our man?
CARTER	Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
LEE	You sound like that all the time.
CARTER	Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
LEE	Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
CARTER	Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
LEE	Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
CARTER	The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.

CARTER	Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
LEE	He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
CARTER	He'll be back soon.
LEE	How do you know?
CARTER	Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.

LEE	Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
CARTER	Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
LEE	The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
CARTER	You pull a muscle or something?
LEE	My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
CARTER	I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
LEE	It's a long story.
CARTER	Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
LEE	No.  It was my singing.
CARTER	Excuse me?
LEE	She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.

LEE	She's just standing around -- not doing much.
CARTER	Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
LEE	I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.

LEE	Slow down, baby.
CARTER	What did you say?
LEE	Nothing.  I said nothing.

LEE	Is it hot in here?
CARTER	Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
LEE	I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
CARTER	What's going on?

LEE	She's getting undressed.
CARTER	Gimme the binoculars.
LEE	No.  It's not right.
CARTER	Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.

LEE	What's she doing?
CARTER	Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
LEE	I don't want to hear this.
CARTER	Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
LEE	Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
CARTER	She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.

CARTER	Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
LEE	What?
CARTER	She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
LEE	What is it?
CARTER	No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...

LEE	I don't understand?
CARTER	She's walking back towards the door.

CARTER	Pick it up!
LEE	It's your turn!
CARTER	I don't need a turn!

LEE	Wait!  There's people down there!
CARTER	There's people up here!
LEE	Get it out of here!
CARTER	Take it!

CARTER	I wouldn't do that!!!
LEE	It's a bomb.

CARTER	Let me see it again?
LEE	We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.

CARTER	Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
LEE	We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
CARTER	They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
LEE	She never even looked at you.
CARTER	You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
LEE	I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
CARTER	Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.

LEE	Are you okay?
CARTER	What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
LEE	She saved our lives.
CARTER	For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.

CARTER	Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
LEE	Shhh, my head hurts.
CARTER	I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
LEE	Why did you help me?
CARTER	It doesn't matter.

LEE	I'm not used to having a partner.
CARTER	We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
LEE	Well we're not friends.
CARTER	You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
LEE	Fine with me.
CARTER	I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
LEE	See you in the next world.
CARTER	I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
LEE	Fine.
CARTER	I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
LEE	Yes.  We have heaven.
CARTER	Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
LEE	What's a Chinese heaven?
CARTER	I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
LEE	I think we should stop talking.
CARTER	Fine by me.
CARTER	You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
LEE	No.
CARTER	If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
LEE	Mind your own business.
CARTER	How was the sex?
LEE	There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
CARTER	You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
LEE	No mu-shu.
CARTER	What about a little king pao chicken?
LEE	No kung pao chicken.  Never.
CARTER	Steamed dumplings?
LEE	Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
CARTER	That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
LEE	Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
CARTER	Are you serious?
LEE	Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

CARTER	As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
LEE	I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
CARTER	That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
LEE	They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
CARTER	Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.

CARTER	Very nice.
LEE	It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
CARTER	I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.

CARTER	Hello, Benjamin.
LEE	Who's Benjamin?
CARTER	Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
LEE	A Chinese man discovered electricity.
CARTER	No Chinese man discovered electricity.
LEE	Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
CARTER	Now that I believe.

LEE	We're slowing down.  This must be it.
CARTER	End of the line.
LEE	You've been a good friend, James Carter.
CARTER	Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
LEE	You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
CARTER	Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.

LEE	Vegas...
CARTER	Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.

LEE	Red Dragon.
CARTER	That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.

LEE	Let's go.
CARTER	Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
LEE	What is Mac out?
CARTER	Follow me my Asian brother.

CARTER	Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
LEE	Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.

CARTER	That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
LEE	Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
CARTER	Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.

LEE	Carter...here comes the rich white man.
CARTER	Wait here.  I'll handle this.

CARTER	Lee, what the hell are you doing?
LEE	Dancing?
CARTER	Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
LEE	It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.

CARTER	Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
LEE	No.  I'm going to find out.
CARTER	Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.

CARTER	I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.
LEE	Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
CARTER	I'll give it my best shot.

CARTER	Lee!
LEE	MMMMMM!!!!

CARTER	Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
LEE	I did!
CARTER	No you didn't!
LEE	Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!

LEE	Ricky Tan is alive.
CARTER	What?!?!
LEE	We have to get to the Penthouse.

CARTER	You go after Ricky.  I got this.
LEE	Carter...
CARTER	Just GO!

CARTER	Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
LEE	It's worth it to me.

CARTER	We made it, man.
LEE	No problem.

CARTER	I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
LEE	She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.

CARTER	That your gate down there?
LEE	Yes.
CARTER	I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
LEE	I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
CARTER	You take care of yourself, Lee.

CARTER	Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
LEE	It's okay.  I can finally let it go.

LEE	What is this?
CARTER	About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
LEE	No, Carter.  I can't take this.
CARTER	It's okay, I got lots more.

CARTER	They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
LEE	This money is evidence.
CARTER	Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.

LEE	I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
CARTER	New York City?
LEE	First class.
CARTER	The Plaza Hotel?
LEE	A little Mu-shu.
CARTER	Some Kung-Pao?

CARTER	I could use a little vacation.
LEE	Amen to that, brother.

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
CARTER	What "revenge" is he talking about?
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
CARTER	Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
CARTER	Fine with me.

ISABELLA	I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
LEE	Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.

LEE	Is this a payoff?
ISABELLA	No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?

ISABELLA	It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
LEE	And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
ISABELLA	Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.

ISABELLA	Put your arms around me.
LEE	Excuse me?

LEE	What's going on?
ISABELLA	I need your help.
LEE	Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
ISABELLA	I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.

ISABELLA	You move well.
LEE	Just trying to make it look real.
ISABELLA	Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.

ISABELLA	Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
LEE	Why don't you go get them?
ISABELLA	If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.

ISABELLA	The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
LEE	How do I know I can trust you?
ISABELLA	Dip me!

ISABELLA	I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
LEE	No.  But I'll help you.

LEE	Are you okay?
ISABELLA	I'm fine.

LEE	I didn't know which side you were on.
ISABELLA	Now you know.

KENNY	Master Ching taught me.
LEE	The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
KENNY	No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.

KENNY	What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
LEE	Baby Duck?
KENNY	That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.

LEE	Do you still have the bills?
KENNY	I still have my lunch money from third grade.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
LEE	Any leads?
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
LEE	It's my responsibility.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
LEE	The Secret Service?  Why?

LEE	All he wanted was some mu-shu.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Are you okay, Lee?

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
LEE	Did you tell Sterling?
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
LEE	Thank you.

SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
LEE	I'll take him.

RICKY TAN	Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
LEE	You must come with me for questioning.

RICKY TAN	Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
LEE	Don't.

RICKY TAN	... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
LEE	The police can protect you.
RICKY TAN	Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
LEE	Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
RICKY TAN	There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...

RICKY TAN	You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
LEE	Put the plates down.  It's over.
RICKY TAN	I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.

LEE	If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
RICKY TAN	Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.

MASTER FU	Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
LEE	Yes, Master.

LEE	I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
MASTER FU	Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.

MASTER FU	He was the best I ever trained, you know.
LEE	Ricky Tan?
MASTER FU	No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --

MASTER FU	A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
LEE	I know, Master, but...
MASTER FU	The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
LEE	Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
MASTER FU	It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	This is still Hong Kong.
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?

SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Who the hell is that?
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN	That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING	Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.

MAN'S VOICE	You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
CARTER	Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".

CARTER	You know what a phone booth is?!
MAN'S VOICE	The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.

CARTER	Lee!  It's him!
MAN'S VOICE	The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
CARTER	Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
MAN'S VOICE	In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
CARTER	That's some serious poundage in dollars.

MAN'S VOICE	What is your name?
CARTER	That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
MAN'S VOICE	Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
CARTER	Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
MAN'S VOICE	Shut up!
CARTER	OK. Say what it is.
MAN'S VOICE	The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.

DIEL	I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
CARTER	Sir, I can explain.
DIEL	What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
CARTER	I know, but --
DIEL	That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.

DIEL	Good job.
CARTER	Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
DIEL	I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.

CARTER	Feds asked for me?
DIEL	They asked for the best street man I had.

CARTER	And that, of course, would be me.
DIEL	Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.

CARTER	Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
WHITNEY	Carter.

CARTER	He stole my wheel!
WHITNEY	This is pathetic.
CARTER	I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!

WHITNEY	He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
CARTER	Tell me about it.
WHITNEY	He was just doing his job.
CARTER	So was I.

LEE	You talk very fast.
CARTER	Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.

LEE	Beach Boy.
CARTER	You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
LEE	Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --

LEE	Help me Rhonda.
CARTER	Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.

CARTER	You have one of these?
LEE	No.
CARTER	Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.

CARTER	You speak English!
LEE	A little.
CARTER	Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
LEE	I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
CARTER	It's the same thing!
LEE	I am not responsible for your assumptions.
CARTER	You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
LEE	Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
CARTER	Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
LEE	We are both full of shit.
CARTER	Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.

LEE	I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
CARTER	Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.

CARTER	-- what the hell is that?
LEE	What?
CARTER	That silly-ass look on your face.
LEE	I was being polite.
CARTER	Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.

CARTER	Where were we?
LEE	Witnesses.
CARTER	Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.

LEE	I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
CARTER	Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!

CARTER	You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
LEE	It was not my intent --
CARTER	Right....
LEE	Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
CARTER	Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.

LEE	What about them?
CARTER	I know a shortcut.
LEE	Shortcut?
CARTER	You don't know what a shortcut is?

CARTER	You make the plate?
LEE	What plate?
CARTER	The license!  You get it?!
LEE	No.
CARTER	What the hell kinda cop are you?!
LEE	Did you make the plate?!
CARTER	It was my ass that almost got trashed!
LEE	He was trying to kill me, not you.
CARTER	Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
LEE	It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
CARTER	Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.

LEE	When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
CARTER	What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
LEE	No. I just made it up.

LEE	I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
CARTER	Don't go there...
LEE	I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
CARTER	Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
LEE	I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
CARTER	Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?

CARTER	Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
LEE	Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.

CARTER	When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
LEE	Stooly.
CARTER	What?
LEE	Stool pigeon.
CARTER	Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.

LEE	You talk too fast.
CARTER	Come on!

CARTER	Let's go.  Everybody take off?
LEE	Took off. Yes. They took off.

CARTER	You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
LEE	Thank you. I learn a great deal.
CARTER	It happens.

CARTER	Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
LEE	That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
CARTER	Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
LEE	Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.

LEE	You like it?
CARTER	Yeah, it's good.
LEE	That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.

LEE	You want more?
CARTER	No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.

CARTER	Now, that's American music.
LEE	Yes, I know this song.
CARTER	You know War?
LEE	Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²

CARTER	That's not how it goes.
LEE	Yes, I think so.
CARTER	No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
LEE	Yee-aww.

CARTER	Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
LEE	Good God, ya'll!
CARTER	No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.

LEE	Are you OK?
CARTER	I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.

LEE	Want some?
CARTER	No, fish is a PM food.
LEE	Excuse me?
CARTER	Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.

CARTER	What?!
LEE	It's him.

CARTER	Which one?
LEE	Going into the restaurant.

LEE	This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
CARTER	This concrete?  This is still America.
LEE	What do you hear?

CARTER	OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
LEE	I am from outa town.
CARTER	No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.

CARTER	Like that.
LEE	I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.

LEE	No, please, I don't --
CARTER	It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.

CARTER	No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
LEE	Oh yes.

LEE	Oh no, I dropped it.
CARTER	You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
LEE	I'm sorry.

CARTER	I'm sorry, Lee.
LEE	Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.

LEE	What are you doing here?
CARTER	Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.

LEE	Oh no.
CARTER	What?
LEE	The art.

LEE	No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
CARTER	Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.

LEE	Oh my god. Griffin.
CARTER	You know him?

LEE	What a surprise!
CARTER	FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
LEE	It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
CARTER	No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
LEE	Oh, I think you like this very much.

CARTER	Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
JOHNSON	Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.

CARTER	Not anymore.
JOHNSON	Where'd you get it?

CARTER	You're killin' me here.
JOHNSON	Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
CARTER	Oh, baby, you cruel...

JOHNSON	Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
CARTER	Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.

CARTER	Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
JOHNSON	The Feds?!
CARTER	FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.

CARTER	Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
JOHNSON	No...what?
CARTER	I could get promoted right out of here.
JOHNSON	What's wrong with that?
CARTER	I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?

CARTER	How'd what go?
JOHNSON	With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?

CARTER	Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
JOHNSON	They put you in charge?
CARTER	In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
JOHNSON	Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
CARTER	Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
JOHNSON	OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.

JOHNSON	Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
CARTER	No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.

JOHNSON	You got a lot of guts calling me.
CARTER	Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
JOHNSON	You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
CARTER	Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.

JOHNSON	Jesus...what do you want?
CARTER	This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
JOHNSON	This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
CARTER	Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?

CARTER	Oh my god...what happened to you?
JOHNSON	It's called a dress.
CARTER	It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?

JOHNSON	Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
CARTER	What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
JOHNSON	Yeah, if you're Superfly.
CARTER	That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!

JOHNSON	You don't like it?
CARTER	It's okay. For restaurants.

CARTER	You OK?
JOHNSON	We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
CARTER	Yeah. So why you look do down?
JOHNSON	Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
CARTER	Not to me. Never to me.

JOHNSON	How about a lift home?
CARTER	Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.

CARTER	Any demands yet?
RUSS	At this point we don't have much.
CARTER	How much they want?
RUSS	You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
CARTER	Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.

RUSS	... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
CARTER	Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
RUSS	He is the situation.

CARTER	I'm talking about the girl.
RUSS	Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.

CARTER	What kind of assignment is that?
RUSS	Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
CARTER	Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
RUSS	Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
CARTER	What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
RUSS	Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.

RUSS	What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
CARTER	Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --

CARTER	You understand what I'm sayin'?
RUSS	Carter, shut up!

CARTER	Yo, Johnson...
RUSS	You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
CARTER	Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
RUSS	That's what you were supposed to be!

CARTER	Hmmmm?
RUSS	Don't play bullshit games with me.
CARTER	Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.

CARTER	Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
RUSS	Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
CARTER	No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.

CARTER	Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
RUSS	I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
CARTER	What?!
RUSS	And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.

CARTER	Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
LAFONTAINE	Shut up!
CARTER	You a cop or something?
LAFONTAINE	Or somethin'.

CARTER	This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
LAFONTAINE	I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
CARTER	I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
LAFONTAINE	Nobody touches me.
CARTER	Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?

CARTER	You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
LAFONTAINE	What are you talking about?

CARTER	What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
LAFONTAINE	I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

CARTER	Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
LAFONTAINE	Do it!

CARTER	You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
LAFONTAINE	What are you talking about?
CARTER	You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
LAFONTAINE	How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
CARTER	All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.

LAFONTAINE	You sonuvabitch.
CARTER	I'm waitin' here for a name.

CARTER	Where do we find him?
LAFONTAINE	You don't. He finds you. Through his people.

HAN	Hello.
SANG'S VOICE	Ambassador Han.
HAN	Yes.
SANG'S VOICE	Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.

HAN	My daughter.
SANG'S VOICE	She's fine.
HAN	Can I speak with her?

HAN	Yes.
SANG'S VOICE	You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
HAN	Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --

HAN	Hello.
SANG'S VOICE	Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
HAN	I want to speak with my daughter!

HAN	Hello.
MAN'S VOICE	Han?
HAN	Yes.
MAN'S VOICE	It's Griffin.
HAN	Griffin?  Where are you.

HAN	Yes.
MAN'S VOICE	You have what I asked for?
HAN	I do.
MAN'S VOICE	Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.

HAN	I would like one of my people to help.
RUSS	Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
HAN	He is very good.
RUSS	As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.

HAN	I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
RUSS	I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
HAN	He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.

HAN	Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
RUSS	Carter, can I have a moment?

HAN	I am so sorry about your men.
RUSS	Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
HAN	And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
RUSS	Don't worry, he's with Carter.

SOON YOUNG	When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
LEE	I still have work to do here.
SOON YOUNG	I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
LEE	I was trying to find the right time.
SOON YOUNG	After I left?

SOON YOUNG	I will not have friends in America.
LEE	Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.

SETH	There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
ANNIE	Is there somebody else?
SETH	Nope.
ANNIE	You don't love me, is that it?
SETH	Nope.

ANNIE	How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
SETH	That's good.

ANNIE	You take the microwave?
SETH	What am I going to do with a microwave?
ANNIE	You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
SETH	So you're angry.  Big deal.

ANNIE	Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
WHEEDLE	He's got a houseboat.
ANNIE	I hate boats.
WHEEDLE	It sounds nice.
ANNIE	Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
WHEEDLE	Houseboats don't go anywhere.
ANNIE	Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
WHEEDLE	It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
ANNIE	But it's on the water.
WHEEDLE	It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
ANNIE	I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
WHEEDLE	No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.

WALTER	The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
ANNIE	-- who's married to --
WALTER	Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
ANNIE	-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
WALTER	And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
ANNIE	-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --

WALTER	Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
ANNIE	I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
WALTER	Am I what they had in mind?
ANNIE	They're going to love you.

WALTER	Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
ANNIE	He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --

ANNIE	If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
WALTER	My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.

ANNIE	Is that all right with you?
WALTER	Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.

ANNIE	They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
WALTER	I love you.
ANNIE	I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
WALTER	Nope.
ANNIE	Even when you were young?
WALTER	Nope.  Not even when I was young.

WALTER	You sure you don't want to drive with me?
ANNIE	How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
WALTER	I'll wait.
ANNIE	Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.

WALTER	Happy New Year, darling.
ANNIE	Happy New Year.

WALTER	I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
ANNIE	Walter, I'd love to --
WALTER	We'll stay at the Plaza --
ANNIE	Go for a walk in Central Park --
WALTER	Go to the Symphony --

ANNIE	We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
WALTER	What is it?
ANNIE	It's delicious, trust me.
WALTER	Does it have wheat in it?
ANNIE	I don't think so.

WALTER	Who is it?
ANNIE	Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.

WALTER	Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
ANNIE	I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.

ANNIE	Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
WALTER	That doesn't make any sense.
ANNIE	I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.

WALTER	Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
ANNIE	Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
WALTER	When you get back, I'll be gone --
ANNIE	And then I'll see you in New York --
WALTER	Okay, okay.

ANNIE	You go.
WALTER	Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
ANNIE	I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
WALTER	What?
ANNIE	About forever.
WALTER	No.
ANNIE	Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.

ANNIE	Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
WALTER	You couldn't.
ANNIE	I do.
WALTER	It's just like my grandmother's china.

ANNIE	Walter.
WALTER	It was my mother's.
ANNIE	It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.

WALTER	Beautiful view, isn't it?
ANNIE	Walter, there's something I have to tell you --

ANNIE	I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
WALTER	-- it was a betrayal.
ANNIE	Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
WALTER	So what happened?
ANNIE	I told you.  Nothing --
WALTER	At the top of the Empire State Building --
ANNIE	I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
WALTER	Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?

ANNIE	Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
WALTER	I think that's what I'm saying.

ANNIE	You okay?
WALTER	Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.

ANNIE	Oh!
WALTER	What?
ANNIE	Look!

BECKY	You should write something about this.
ANNIE	About what?
BECKY	Whatever it is.

BECKY	It's not true, but it feels true.
ANNIE	There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --

BECKY	What was that about up there?
ANNIE	What was what?
BECKY	What's with you?
ANNIE	Nothing's with me.

BECKY	Sleepless in Seattle?
ANNIE	That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
BECKY	And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
ANNIE	Actually, he sounded nice.
BECKY	Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
ANNIE	Not.

BECKY	You're a basket case.
ANNIE	They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
BECKY	... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
ANNIE	Dear Sleepless and Son...
BECKY	It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
ANNIE	I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows --

BECKY	And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
ANNIE	I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
BECKY	You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
ANNIE	I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
BECKY	Right.
ANNIE	I should say something in this about magic.
BECKY	What?
ANNIE	I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
BECKY	Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
ANNIE	I want to meet you...

BECKY	On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day.
ANNIE	Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.

BECKY	You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
ANNIE	You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
BECKY	He lost all the weight... there.
ANNIE	That's impossible.  A guy can't --
BECKY	Can too.
ANNIE	No.
BECKY	Yes.
ANNIE	And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
BECKY	Plus he fell in love with a temp.
ANNIE	Listen to this, I love this part --

BECKY	Men never get this movie.
ANNIE	I know.
BECKY	Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
ANNIE	I always wondered about that too.

ANNIE	Hello.
BECKY	Turn on your radio!
ANNIE	What?
BECKY	The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.

ANNIE	I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
BECKY	You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
ANNIE	Definitely.

BECKY	Did you talk to him?
ANNIE	I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?

BECKY	You told a lie and got on a plane.
ANNIE	That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
BECKY	Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
ANNIE	Becky?
BECKY	What?
ANNIE	Is this crazy?
BECKY	No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
ANNIE	Thank you.  I love you.
BECKY	I love you, too.
ANNIE	Good night.

BECKY	You were standing in the middle of the street?
ANNIE	You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
BECKY	I love that dream.
ANNIE	That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
BECKY	But he saw you, right?
ANNIE	He said hello.

BECKY	It's a sign --
ANNIE	It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.

BECKY	You don't know who she was, Annie --
ANNIE	I saw her.  She looked just like this --

BECKY	This is a photo of hair.
ANNIE	Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.

ANNIE	Becky?
BECKY	So I mailed your letter.
ANNIE	Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle.
BECKY	M.F.E.O.?
ANNIE	Made for each other.

BECKY	So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
ANNIE	I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
BECKY	What about the letter?
ANNIE	It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.

BECKY	You're going to miss the train.
ANNIE	No, I'm not. 
BECKY	What are your plans in New York?
ANNIE	We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
BECKY	I love the symphony.
ANNIE	I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.

ANNIE	I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
DET. WHEEDLE	Okay.
ANNIE	She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
DET. WHEEDLE	Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
ANNIE	No, I know that part --
DET. WHEEDLE	So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
ANNIE	No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
DET. WHEEDLE	A sense of humor.
ANNIE	I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
DET. WHEEDLE	Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
ANNIE	No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
DET. WHEEDLE	You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --

LAURIE	Honey, he wasn't right for you.
ANNIE	I know.
LAURIE	He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
ANNIE	I know. 

LAURIE	Maybe you should see a shrink.
ANNIE	I want my money.
LAURIE	Go home for the weekend.
ANNIE	That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?

ANNIE	Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
JONAH	And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --

JONAH	Please --
ANNIE	This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --

JONAH	This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
ANNIE	How am I going to explain this to Walter?

JONAH	Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
ANNIE	Come on, Jonah --

JONAH	Are you Annie?
ANNIE	Yes.

JONAH	I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
ANNIE	Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
JONAH	Howard.
ANNIE	Howard.

ANNIE	I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
TOM	What?
ANNIE	I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
TOM	I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
ANNIE	But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
TOM	Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
ANNIE	I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
TOM	It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
ANNIE	I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
TOM	Yes, I did.
ANNIE	Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
TOM	Any time.

BARBARA	Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
ANNIE	Walter and I are engaged!

ANNIE	It's probably just the flowers --
BARBARA	We'll move them --

BARBARA	The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
ANNIE	Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
BARBARA	I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
ANNIE	I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
BARBARA	Are his folks nice?
ANNIE	You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
BARBARA	How did it happen?

ANNIE	It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
BARBARA	How amazing.
ANNIE	It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
BARBARA	Destiny takes a hand.
ANNIE	Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
BARBARA	Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
ANNIE	It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.

BARBARA	I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
ANNIE	What?
BARBARA	You know.
ANNIE	What?
BARBARA	Magic.  It was magic.
ANNIE	Magic.
BARBARA	I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
ANNIE	Mom!
BARBARA	Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
ANNIE	Mom, we already...
BARBARA	Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
ANNIE	Like... clockwork.

BARBARA	So you'll get married in a new dress.
ANNIE	It's a sign.
BARBARA	You don't believe in signs.

ANNIE	Sure you do.
SAM	Sure you do --

SAM	You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
ANNIE	Magic.
SAM	Magic.

SAM	Hello.
ANNIE	Hello.

ANNIE	Hi.
SAM	Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
ANNIE	Shhhh --

SAM	It's you.
ANNIE	It's me?
SAM	The one in the street.  I chased after you.

BOB	Which means --
SAM	The cabinets have to be redone --

SAM	Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
BOB	Grace heard it.
SAM	Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
BOB	The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
SAM	Why me? What about Jay?

BOB	Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
SAM	Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.

SAM	Hello.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.

SAM	I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
SAM	Who is this?
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
SAM	Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --

SAM	I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.

SAM	All righ...
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
SAM	It's been about a year and a half.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Have you had any relationship since?
SAM	No.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Why not?
SAM	Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	And I don't want to invade your privacy --

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
SAM	What's she talking about?

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
SAM	It's hard to imagine.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	What are you going to do, Sam?
SAM	I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	What was it that made you know?
SAM	I don't think I could really describe it.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Why not?
SAM	And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
JONAH	It's not that late in Seattle.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
JONAH	It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	You don't like the one he was now?
JONAH	He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Where's your mom?
JONAH	She died.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
JONAH	I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	And you're worried about him.
JONAH	I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.

JONAH	No.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Why not?
JONAH	It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	You want me to talk to him?

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Is he home right now?
JONAH	Yeah.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
JONAH	I don't know --
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
JONAH	Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	Fair enough.

DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
JONAH	Tell her how you don't sleep at night.

SUZY	They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
GREG	What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?

SUZY	Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
GREG	How about rapacious and love- starved?
SUZY	No.
GREG	It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
SUZY	It is not --
GREG	Right, right.

JAY	Hey, my plate is full.
SAM	Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.

JAY	Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
SAM	I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
JAY	And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
SAM	You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
JAY	Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.

JAY	When's the latest time you were out there?
SAM	Seventy... eight.
JAY	Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
SAM	I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
JAY	Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
SAM	What's tira misu?
JAY	You'll find out.
SAM	What is it?
JAY	You'll see.
SAM	Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
JAY	You'll like it.
SAM	This is going to be tougher than I thought.

JONAH	Dad, could you close the door?
JESSICA	H and G.  Hi and goodbye.

JESSICA	Write her.
JONAH	You think so?
JESSICA	It's Y. O. H.
JONAH	Yeah.  What's that?
JESSICA	Your only hope.

JESSICA	This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
JONAH	I don't get it.
JESSICA	You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.

JONAH	Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
JESSICA	Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
JONAH	Eighty dollars.
JESSICA	I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
JONAH	But how am I going to get there?

JESSICA	Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
JONAH	Window.
JESSICA	Do you want a fruit plate?
JONAH	I don't know.  Do I?
JESSICA	I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.

JONAH	Dad --
SAM	What is it?
JONAH	There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.

JONAH	I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
SAM	I don't think I have to now.

SAM	The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
JONAH	It's a spice rack.
SAM	We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.

JONAH	Dad?  About last night?
SAM	It's never happening again. Right?
JONAH	Right.

JONAH	Not.
SAM	My feelings exactly.

SAM	How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
JONAH	It plays in 50 states.
SAM	What?!
JONAH	Nobody else is going to know it was us.
SAM	You're right.  You better hope so.

JONAH	Dad, I don't know about this one --
SAM	Oh, you're changing your mind --
JONAH	No, I'm not, but --
SAM	What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
JONAH	Dad --

SAM	Does red pepper go under R or P?
JONAH	P.  Dad?
SAM	What?
JONAH	I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
SAM	Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
JONAH	Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.

SAM	Fine.  Fine.
JONAH	So I can go.
SAM	Sure.  Looking good.
JONAH	Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
SAM	I think I know how to have a spice rack.

SAM	I'm sorry.  I'm just --
JONAH	Stressed.
SAM	Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.

SAM	Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
JONAH	They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."

SAM	How did they get our phone number?
JONAH	You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.

JONAH	Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF--  What is that?
SAM	Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
JONAH	This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
SAM	Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
JONAH	Somewhere in the middle.
SAM	I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
JONAH	She's willing to fly anywhere.

SAM	She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
JONAH	Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
SAM	This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
JONAH	English muffin.  How do you do it?
SAM	You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
JONAH	-- a slice of pizza --
SAM	But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
JONAH	It doesn't.  They ask you.
SAM	I'm starting to notice that.

JONAH	If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
SAM	What do you think?
JONAH	Will she scratch up your back?
SAM	What?

JONAH	In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
SAM	Whose show was this on?
JONAH	Jed's got cables.
SAM	Go to sleep.

JONAH	Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
SAM	It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
JONAH	Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
SAM	I know.
JONAH	How do you know?

JONAH	It was sinking.
SAM	What was?
JONAH	Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
SAM	You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
JONAH	Bye bye blackbird.
SAM	Is that what she used to sing?
JONAH	I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
SAM	I don't know.
JONAH	Like do you believe in heaven?
SAM	I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
JONAH	I'm starting to forget her.
SAM	I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.

SAM	I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
JONAH	Good.

SAM	This one's for both of us.
JONAH	Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.

JONAH	Great.
SAM	I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
JONAH	This is a good letter, Dad.
SAM	The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
JONAH	Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
SAM	Now I'm late.  Bye.

JONAH	Listen to this --
SAM	Not now, Jonah --
JONAH	Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
SAM	Jonah, I'm leaving --
JONAH	WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.

JONAH	Dad!
SAM	Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
JONAH	It's a sign.
SAM	Oh, right.

SAM	Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
JONAH	She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
SAM	Perfect.  We'll be there.

JONAH	I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
SAM	There she is.

JONAH	Why is she bringing that bag?
SAM	She's going to cook something for us?

SAM	Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
JONAH	It's only ten o'clock.
SAM	Jonah!
JONAH	Okay.
SAM	Thank Victoria for dinner.
JONAH	Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
SAM	I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.

SAM	Don't ever do that again.
JONAH	I thought I saw a black widow spider.

SAM	What are you doing up?
JONAH	I was thirsty.
SAM	There's a bathroom upstairs.
JONAH	The water tastes better in the kitchen.
SAM	That's true.  Why is that?

SAM	Did you call that radio station again?
JONAH	No.
SAM	Everyone at work heard you.
JONAH	I just called for a second.
SAM	Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
JONAH	It's a short word.
SAM	This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
JONAH	If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.

SAM	Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
JONAH	Was Mom an adjustment?
SAM	I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?

SAM	God, she's beautiful.
JONAH	Victoria? She's okay.

JONAH	Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
SAM	Who is Annie?
JONAH	The one who wrote us.

JONAH	The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
SAM	I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.

SAM	Have you seen my wallet?
JONAH	It might be in the kitchen.

SAM	I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
JONAH	Are you going with her?
SAM	Yes.

SAM	I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
JONAH	This is the one I like.

JONAH	Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
SAM	Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
JONAH	What's wrong with Annie?
SAM	Shut up.

JONAH	Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
SAM	This conversation is finished.
JONAH	You said we could go to New York.
SAM	Did not.
JONAH	Did too.
SAM	I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
JONAH	I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
SAM	Get out.
JONAH	No.
SAM	Goddammit, I am sick of this --

SAM	What if I couldn't get to you?
JONAH	I was scared of what you were gonna do.
SAM	When I found you?
JONAH	If I didn't go.
SAM	Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
JONAH	No.
SAM	I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
JONAH	No.

SAM	I can't believe you flew first class.
JONAH	It was all they had.

SAM	Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
JONAH	Okay.
SAM	What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
JONAH	Sure.

VICTORIA	Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
JONAH	Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --

JONAH	Do you like baseball?
VICTORIA	Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
JONAH	What about camping?
VICTORIA	What about it?
JONAH	Do you like it?
VICTORIA	I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
JONAH	We ought to start camping again, Dad.

JONAH	Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
VICTORIA	Well...
JONAH	I think they're announcing your flight.

SAM	Hi.
LULU	Hi.  Sam?
SAM	Yes?
LULU	You must be Jonah.

LULU	We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
SAM	Thanks, but... we've got plans.
LULU	Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.

SUZY	Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
SAM	Microwave.  Five minutes.

SUZY	Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
SAM	Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
SUZY	I'm sorry --

SAM	God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
SUZY	He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.

SUZY	You saw her in the airport and then here?
SAM	I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.

SUZY	How's Jonah taking it?
SAM	It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
SUZY	You're kidding --
SAM	Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.

SUZY	It's a little derivative.
SAM	What do you mean?
SUZY	An Affair To Remember. Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called "Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."

SAM	Anyway, Victoria's nice.
SUZY	Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
SAM	Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.

SAM	Hi.
VICTORIA	Hi.

SAM	You look good.
VICTORIA	You look good yourself.

VICTORIA	I thought you were never going to call me.
SAM	You did?
VICTORIA	I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
SAM	You could have called me --
VICTORIA	No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
SAM	You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
VICTORIA	Oh.
SAM	So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.

SAM	We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
VICTORIA	I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
SAM	I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.

VICTORIA	Is he there?
SAM	No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
VICTORIA	Absolutely.  Right.

SAM	He's ten.
VICTORIA	He's good at it.
SAM	I read an article about this ...
VICTORIA	I read the same article...
SAM	It takes time --
VICTORIA	Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
SAM	Sure.  Sure.

WILL	We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
ALLEYN	And the title of this piece?
WILL	Mercutio

ALLEYN	Will
WILL	Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.

WILL	You did not like the speech?
ALLEYN	The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.

WILL	Ned
ALLEYN	It's good.
WILL	Oh
ALLEYN	The title won't do.
WILL	Ah
ALLEYN	Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
WILL	Thank you, Ned.

WILL	You are a gentleman.
ALLEYN	And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

WILL	Oh
ALLEYN	He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.

WILL	Follow that boat!
BOATMAN	Right you are, governor!

BOATMAN	I know your face. Are you an actor?
WILL	Yes.
BOATMAN	Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
WILL	Really?
BOATMAN	I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.

WILL	Do you know that house?
BOATMAN	Sir Robert De Lesseps.

WILL	Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
BOATMAN	Writer, is he?

BOATMAN	Thank you, my lady!
WILL	Lady?
BOATMAN	Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.

BURBAGE	What do you want, Kit?
MARLOWE	My Massacre at Paris is complete.
BURBAGE	You have the last act?
MARLOWE	You have the money?
BURBAGE	Tomorrow.
MARLOWE	Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
BURBAGE	Wait!  Will you desist!
MARLOWE	Twenty pounds on delivery
BURBAGE	What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
MARLOWE	Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
BURBAGE	Never!
MARLOWE	Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
BURBAGE	I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
MARLOWE	You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
BURBAGE	Treachery!

HENSLOWE	Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
BURBAGE	The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
HENSLOWE	And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
BURBAGE	Ask him.

HENSLOWE	We have no Juliet!
BURBAGE	No Juliet?!

BURBAGE	We will all be put in the clink.
HENSLOWE	See you in jail.

BURBAGE	There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
WILL	I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
BURBAGE	Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
WILL	When I have fifty pounds.

BURBAGE	Are you writing?
WILL	A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
BURBAGE	What is the chief part?
WILL	Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
BURBAGE	The title?
WILL	Romeo
BURBAGE	I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
WILL	It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
BURBAGE	How much?
WILL	Ten pounds.
BURBAGE	You're a liar.

WILL	I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
BURBAGE	Ned is wrong for it.

BURBAGE	Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
WILL	Done.

WILL	Words, words, words
DR. MOTH	And yet you tell me you lie with women?

DR. MOTH	Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
WILL	Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
DR. MOTH	I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
WILL	I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
DR. MOTH	Interesting.
WILL	Nothing comes.
DR. MOTH	Most interesting.
WILL	It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
DR. MOTH	Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?

DR. MOTH	How long has it been?
WILL	A goodly length in times past, but lately
DR. MOTH	No, no. You have a wife, children

DR. MOTH	A woman of property?
WILL	She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
DR. MOTH	And your relations?
WILL	On my mother's side the Ardens
DR. MOTH	No, your marriage bed.
WILL	Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
DR. MOTH	So now you are free to love
WILL	yet cannot love nor write it.

WILL	Will it restore my gift?
DR. MOTH	The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.

WILL	Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
FENNYMAN	Who is that?

FENNYMAN	I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
WILL	Yes, I saw it.
FENNYMAN	Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe

WILL	Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
FENNYMAN	By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!

WILL	I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
FENNYMAN	That's me.
WILL	And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.

FENNYMAN	When?
HENSLOWE	Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
FENNYMAN	Take his feet out. Where will you get

HENSLOWE	I have a wonderful new play!
FENNYMAN	Put his feet in.
HENSLOWE	It's a comedy.
FENNYMAN	Cut his nose off.
HENSLOWE	A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
FENNYMAN	And his ears.
HENSLOWE	And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
FENNYMAN	Partners!
HENSLOWE	It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.

FENNYMAN	What's the title?
HENSLOWE	Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
FENNYMAN	Good title.

HENSLOWE	But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
FENNYMAN	A share of the profits.
HENSLOWE	There's never any
FENNYMAN	Of course not!
HENSLOWE	Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.

FENNYMAN	Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter
HENSLOWE	Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.

FENNYMAN	This time we take your boots off!
HENSLOWE	What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
FENNYMAN	The theatres are all closed by the plague!
HENSLOWE	Oh, that.
FENNYMAN	by order of the Master of the Revels!
HENSLOWE	Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
FENNYMAN	So what do we do?
HENSLOWE	Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
FENNYMAN	How?
HENSLOWE	I don't know. It's a mystery.

FENNYMAN	Where is the play?
HENSLOWE	Oh, it's coming, it's coming.

FENNYMAN	Is it going well?
HENSLOWE	Very well.
FENNYMAN	But nothing is happening.
HENSLOWE	Yes, but very well.

HENSLOWE	I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
FENNYMAN	Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business

FENNYMAN	Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
HENSLOWE	The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?

HENSLOWE	Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
FENNYMAN	Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.

HENSLOWE	Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
VIOLA	Nobody knew!

HENSLOWE	It is over.
VIOLA	I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.

VIOLA	No Juliet?!
HENSLOWE	it will be all right, madam.
VIOLA	What happened to Sam?
HENSLOWE	Who are you?
VIOLA	Thomas Kent!

HENSLOWE	Do you know it?
VIOLA	Every word.

HENSLOWE	Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
WILL	Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
HENSLOWE	No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
WILL	It is all locked safe in here
HENSLOWE	God be praised!  Locked?
WILL	As soon as I have found my muse

HENSLOWE	Who is she this time?!
WILL	She is always Aphrodite.
HENSLOWE	Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
WILL	Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
HENSLOWE	Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
WILL	What piece? Richard Crookback?
HENSLOWE	No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
WILL	Who wrote that?
HENSLOWE	Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
WILL	Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.

WILL	Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
HENSLOWE	Fifty pounds? What for?
WILL	Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
HENSLOWE	Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
WILL	No, then.

HENSLOWE	Where are you going?
WILL	To my weekly confession.

HENSLOWE	Now where? Will?
WILL	To the Palace at Whitehall.

WILL	I feel a scene coming on.
HENSLOWE	Is it about a pirate's daughter?

WILL	Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
HENSLOWE	Rosaline? You mean Ethel.

HENSLOWE	Will! Have you finished?
WILL	Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.

HENSLOWE	My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
WILL	I did not.
HENSLOWE	Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
WILL	Tomorrow

WILL	We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
HENSLOWE	We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.

HENSLOWE	Nobody. The author.
WILL	We are about to embark on a great voyage.
HENSLOWE	It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
WILL	You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go

WILL	Cut round him for now.
HENSLOWE	What? Who?
WILL	Romeo.
HENSLOWE	The one who came with your letter?
WILL	What?

HENSLOWE	Juliet? You mean Ethel.
WILL	God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?

WILL	By God, I wish I knew.
HENSLOWE	By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!

WILL	We are lost.
HENSLOWE	No, it will turn out well.
WILL	How will it?
HENSLOWE	I don't know, it's a mystery.

HENSLOWE	Another little problem.
WILL	What do we do now?
HENSLOWE	The show must 
WILL	Go on.
HENSLOWE	Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
WILL	How will it?
HENSLOWE	I don't know. It's a mystery.

WILL	Kit
MARLOWE	How goes it, Will?
WILL	Wonderful, wonderful.
MARLOWE	Burbage says you have a play.
WILL	I have. And chinks to show for it.

WILL	I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
WILL	I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
MARLOWE	Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
WILL	I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
MARLOWE	I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
WILL	Good title.
MARLOWE	And yours?
WILL	Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
MARLOWE	What is the story?
WILL	Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
MARLOWE	Romeo is
WILL	Yes, that's good. Until he meets
MARLOWE	Ethel.
WILL	Do you think?
MARLOWE	The daughter of his enemy.
WILL	The daughter of his enemy.
MARLOWE	His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
WILL	Mercutio

WILL	Good luck with yours, Kit.
MARLOWE	I thought your play was for Burbage.
WILL	This is a different one.
MARLOWE	A different one you haven't written?

NOL AS BENVOLIO	Good morrow, cousin.
VIOLA AS ROMEO	Is the day so young?

NOL AS BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.
VIOLA AS ROMEO	Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
NOL AS BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
VIOLA AS ROMEO	Not having that which, having, makes them short.

VIOLA AS ROMEO	Out.
NOL AS BENVOLIO	Of love?
VIOLA AS ROMEO	Out of her favour where I am in love.

WESSEX	Two hours at prayer!
NURSE	Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
WESSEX	Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
NURSE	It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
WESSEX	It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.

WESSEX	Not ready? Where is she?
NURSE	Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
WESSEX	Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!

NURSE	Be good to her, my lord!
WESSEX	I will.

NURSE	God bless you!
WESSEX	Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.

VIOLA	Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
NURSE	I liked the dog, for laughs.
VIOLA	But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
NURSE	When the Queen commands it.
VIOLA	But at the playhouse. Nurse?
NURSE	Be still.

NURSE	Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
VIOLA	I am not so well-born.
NURSE	Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
VIOLA	All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
NURSE	Like Valentine and Silvia?
VIOLA	No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
NURSE	As a nurse.
VIOLA	But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.

VIOLA	He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
NURSE	Verona again.
VIOLA	A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!

NURSE	Your mother, and your father
VIOLA	From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
NURSE	He looks well enough for a mountebank.
VIOLA	Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
NURSE	My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
VIOLA	You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!

VIOLA	Your Majesty.
QUEEN	Stand up straight, girl.

QUEEN	I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
VIOLA	Your Majesty.
QUEEN	What do you love so much?
VIOLA	Your Majesty
QUEEN	Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
VIOLA	I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
QUEEN	They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.

QUEEN	And--?
VIOLA	And I love poetry above all.
QUEEN	Above Lord Wessex?

QUEEN	But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
VIOLA	Oh, but they can!

WESSEX	Your Majesty
QUEEN	There was a wager, I remember

WESSEX	Your Majesty!
QUEEN	Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?
WESSEX	Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?

QUEEN	As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
QUEEN	Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
WESSEX	Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
QUEEN	Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.

RALPH AS NURSE	I know not.
SAM AS JULIET	Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

SAM AS JULIET	nan
RALPH AS NURSE	Madam!
SAM AS JULIET	I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--
RALPH AS NURSE	Madam!
SAM AS JULIET	By and by I come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!"

ROSALINE	When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
WILL	I have lost my gift.
ROSALINE	You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
WILL	Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
ROSALINE	Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.

ROSALINE	Will!
WILL	I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.

WILL	Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
SAM	I am, Master Shakespeare.
WILL	But your voice  Have they dropped?
SAM	No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
WILL	Master Henslowe, you have your actors.

SAM	Master Shakespeare
WILL	Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam
SAM	It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
WILL	Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
SAM	Parting is such sweet sorrow

VIOLA AS ROMEO	nan
SAM AS JULIET	Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
VIOLA AS ROMEO	Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

VIOLA AS ROMEO	Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd.
SAM AS JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

VIOLA AS ROMEO	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
L499530	u7570	m511	VIOLA AS ROMEO	Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
VIOLA AS ROMEO	She speaks.
L499557	u7565	m511	SAM AS JULIET	Ay me."

SAM AS JULIET	I would not for the world!
VIOLA AS ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.

VIOLA AS ROMEO	O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
SAM AS JULIET	What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?
VIOLA AS ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

SIR ROBERT	She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
WESSEX	My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
SIR ROBERT	She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
WESSEX	Is she obedient?
SIR ROBERT	As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
WESSEX	I like her.

TILNEY	Like you, I found him not at home!
WILL	So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.

TILNEY	What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
WILL	You have opened the playhouses?
TILNEY	I have, Master Shakespeare.
WILL	But the plague
TILNEY	Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.

WILL	Who are you, master?
URCHIN	I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
WILL	I'll be damned if you are!

WILL	Better fortune, boy.
URCHIN	I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
WILL	You admire it?

URCHIN	I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
WILL	Oh. What is your name?

URCHIN	Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
WILL	I have to get back.

WILL	My lady!
VIOLA	Who is there?
WILL	Will Shakespeare!

VIOLA	Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
WILL	The same, alas.
VIOLA	Oh but why "alas?"
WILL	A lowly player.
VIOLA	Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
WILL	Oh--I am him too!

WILL	Oh my lady, my love!
VIOLA	If they find you here they will kill you.
WILL	You can bring them with a word.
VIOLA	Oh, not for the world!

WILL	Can you love a fool?
VIOLA	Can you love a player?

WILL	Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
VIOLA	Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
WILL	I am.
VIOLA	Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.

VIOLA	I do not know how to undress a man.
WILL	It is strange to me, too.

VIOLA	I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
WILL	There is.
VIOLA	Even your play.
WILL	Oh
VIOLA	And that was only my first try.
WILL	Well perhaps better than my first. 

VIOLA	You would not leave me?
WILL	I must. Look-- how pale the window.
VIOLA	Moonlight!
WILL	No, the morning rooster woke me.
VIOLA	It was the owl--come to bed

WILL	Oh, let Henslowe wait.
VIOLA	Mr. Henslowe?
WILL	Let him be damned for his pages!
VIOLA	Oh--no, no!
WILL	There is time. It is still dark.
VIOLA	It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
WILL	It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.

VIOLA	Oh, do not go
WILL	I must. I must

VIOLA	Oh, Will!
WILL	Yes, some of it is speakable.

WILL	Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
VIOLA	That's my line!
WILL	Oh, but it is mine too!

WILL	I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
VIOLA	Oh, but it will end well for love?
WILL	In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
VIOLA	Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.

WILL	You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
VIOLA	What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
WILL	To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
VIOLA	You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
WILL	Then I will go with you.
VIOLA	You cannot, Wessex will kill you
WILL	I know how to fight!
VIOLA	Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.

VIOLA	Will! What--?
WILL	A literary feud. Quite normal.

WILL	Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
VIOLA	You never spoke so well of him.
WILL	He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
VIOLA	You lie.

VIOLA	You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
WILL	My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
VIOLA	Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
WILL	I was the more deceived.

VIOLA	I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
WILL	Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
VIOLA	You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
WILL	You cannot marry Wessex!
VIOLA	If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.

WILL	No
VIOLA	But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.

VIOLA	Will you read it for me?
WILL	Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
VIOLA	It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

WILL	nan
VIOLA	I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.

VIOLA	A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
WILL	I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
VIOLA	It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
WILL	I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
VIOLA	If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.

VIOLA	The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
WILL	A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
VIOLA	An excellent beginning  Let him be
WILL	Sold in marriage and half way to America.
VIOLA	At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?
WILL	Orsino
VIOLA	But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
WILL	and thus unable to declare her love

VIOLA	But all ends well.
WILL	How does it?
VIOLA	I don't know. It's a mystery

WILL	You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
VIOLA	Nor you for me.
WILL	Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
VIOLA	Write me well.

WESSEX	My lady Viola.
VIOLA	My lord.
WESSEX	I have spoken with your father.
VIOLA	So my lord? I speak with him every day.

WESSEX	My lady VIOLA.
VIOLA	Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
WESSEX	I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
VIOLA	You flatter, my lord.
WESSEX	No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
VIOLA	Do you intend to marry, my lord?
WESSEX	Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
VIOLA	I do not love you, my lord.
WESSEX	How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
VIOLA	Virginia?!
WESSEX	Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
VIOLA	But why me?
WESSEX	It was your eyes. No, your lips.

WESSEX	Will you defy your father and your Queen?
VIOLA	The Queen has consented?
WESSEX	She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
VIOLA	I will do my duty, my lord.

VIOLA	Good morning, my lord!
WESSEX	Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!

VIOLA	I mean
WESSEX	Lady Viola is

WESSEX	You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
VIOLA	It is not my riding day, my lord.
WESSEX	Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
VIOLA	I am going to church.
WESSEX	I understand of course. It is to be expected.
VIOLA	It is to be expected on a Sunday.
WESSEX	And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
VIOLA	Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
WESSEX	Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.

VIOLA	He is dead?
WESSEX	Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul

WILL	Your name?
VIOLA AS THOMAS	Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.

WILL	Take off your hat.
VIOLA AS THOMAS	My hat?
WILL	Where did you learn how to do that?
VIOLA AS THOMAS	I . . .
WILL	Wait there.
VIOLA AS THOMAS	Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
WILL	Let me see you. Take off your hat.

VIOLA AS THOMAS	Yes, sir.
WILL	Do you understand me?
VIOLA AS THOMAS	No, sir.
WILL	He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?

VIOLA AS THOMAS	I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
WILL	Of course you have not! I have not written it!

WILL	She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
VIOLA AS THOMAS	If you love her, you must do what she asks.
WILL	And break her heart and mine?
VIOLA AS THOMAS	It is only ours you can know.
WILL	She loves me, Thomas!
VIOLA AS THOMAS	Does she say so?
WILL	No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
VIOLA AS THOMAS	I 
WILL	Your aunt?
VIOLA AS THOMAS	Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
WILL	Like a sickness and its cure together.
VIOLA AS THOMAS	Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
WILL	Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.

VIOLA AS THOMAS	And her lips?
WILL	Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
VIOLA AS THOMAS	And her voice? Like lark song?
WILL	Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
VIOLA AS THOMAS	She sings too?
WILL	Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
VIOLA AS THOMAS	What of her bosom?
WILL	Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
VIOLA AS THOMAS	I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
WILL	Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
VIOLA AS THOMAS	But what of Lord Wessex?
WILL	For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!

VIOLA AS THOMAS	Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
WILL	It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.

WESSEX	Poet?
WILL	I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.

WILL	How do I offend, my lord?
WESSEX	By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
WILL	Christopher Marlowe at your service.

WILL	Here we come at last, my lord!
WESSEX	Are you bringing your laundry woman?
WILL	Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
WESSEX	On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
WILL	Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!

WESSEX	Is there a man?
WILL	A man, my lord?
WESSEX	There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
WILL	A theatre poet?
WESSEX	An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
WILL	Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
WESSEX	That dog!

WESSEX	You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
WILL	You are on my ground.
WESSEX	By God, I'll fight the lot of you

ALEX	What's his name?
DAVID	I don't know -- Campbell or something?

DAVID	All right, just a few questions.
ALEX	I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.

DAVID	Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
ALEX	Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?

DAVID	Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
ALEX	With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?

ALEX	Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
DAVID	Serve.
ALEX	I was trying to educate you.
DAVID	Just serve.
ALEX	In the same fashion as chess.
DAVID	What?
ALEX	Chess. Chess is often used as well.
DAVID	Will you shut up and play.
ALEX	You're a bad loser.
DAVID	I haven't lost yet.

ALEX	I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
DAVID	Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
ALEX	You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
DAVID	Discussion group, Alex, discussion.

ALEX	What do you think?
DAVID	About what?
ALEX	About this guy, this Hugo person.
DAVID	I don't have time.
ALEX	I'm only asking what you think.
DAVID	I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.

DAVID	He made it clear.
ALEX	Why, thank you, David.

DAVID	Only on expenses.
ALEX	It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...

ALEX	No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
ALEX	Have you seen him?
DAVID	Alex, I don't have the time --
ALEX	Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
DAVID	No.

DAVID	I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
ALEX	Can I show you something?

DAVID	No.
ALEX	Think about it.
DAVID	No.
ALEX	Come on, David.
DAVID	No.
ALEX	Juliet?

DAVID	You mean immoral.
ALEX	I'm only asking you both to think about it.
DAVID	It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
ALEX	But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
DAVID	You think so?
ALEX	All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.

DAVID	He's still here.
ALEX	He couldn't get his car started.
DAVID	When are you going to let the police know?
ALEX	You call them if you want.
DAVID	And what about you?

ALEX	Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
ALEX	A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
DAVID	So who's going to do it?
ALEX	Dig the pit, I don't know.
DAVID	No, not that.
ALEX	Then what? Who's going to do what?
DAVID	You know what I'm talking about.
ALEX	Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
DAVID	You know what. Who's going to do it.
ALEX	We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
DAVID	I can't do it.
ALEX	I don't hear this.
DAVID	I won't be able to.
ALEX	You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
DAVID	I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.

ALEX	Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
DAVID	I just thought we should discuss it.
ALEX	Take his legs.

DAVID	I don't know.
ALEX	Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.

DAVID	Finished.
ALEX	But not quite.
DAVID	Is that going to be deep enough?

ALEX	Don't you worry about that.
DAVID	Is this necessary?
ALEX	Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.

ALEX	That was good.
DAVID	Can we talk about something?
ALEX	Not now. I have an idea.

DAVID	Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
ALEX	Just stop worrying.

ALEX	What's the problem?
DAVID	I want to talk now.
ALEX	After you drink to love and happiness forever.
DAVID	Now.
ALEX	After.

ALEX	Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
DAVID	Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --

ALEX	Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
DAVID	You think so?

DAVID	How much did you pay?
ALEX	I don't know.
DAVID	How much did you pay?
ALEX	I don't know.
DAVID	How much?
ALEX	I don't know.

ALEX	What is this?
DAVID	Security.
DAVID	From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
DAVID	There was a break-in.
ALEX	Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.

DAVID	Doesn't it worry you?
ALEX	No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.

ALEX	What's all this for, more security?
DAVID	I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
ALEX	Oh, that'll come in useful.

DAVID	What? Yes, that's fine.
ALEX	You're sure? There's lots more.
DAVID	No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
ALEX	What's wrong?
DAVID	Nothing.
ALEX	You're not eating.
DAVID	Not eating what?
ALEX	Not eating like you used to, that's what.
DAVID	If you give me the plate, I'll eat.

DAVID	I want to secure it.
ALEX	Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?

DAVID	You looking for me?
ALEX	Looking for you? Yes.
DAVID	What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
ALEX	We just wanted to speak to you.

ALEX	Who?
DAVID	Your friends.
ALEX	I don't know what you're talking about.

DAVID	It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
ALEX	It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
DAVID	I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
ALEX	I beg your pardon?

DAVID	But they know.
ALEX	They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
DAVID	They know.
ALEX	They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
DAVID	Except the money.

DAVID	Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
ALEX	Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
DAVID	You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
ALEX	So I gathered.
DAVID	Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
ALEX	It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
DAVID	No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
ALEX	Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
DAVID	For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
ALEX	Not at all.
DAVID	I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
ALEX	Yeah?
DAVID	But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?

DAVID	No, can't think of anything else that matters.
ALEX	About the mail --
DAVID	It's very kind of you to offer, but --
ALEX	Where do you think you'll go?
DAVID	Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?

DAVID	What?
ALEX	I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
DAVID	Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.

EDITOR	Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
ALEX	I don't know anything about it.
EDITOR	Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
ALEX	Cover it?
EDITOR	Well?
ALEX	But there's no --
EDITOR	Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
ALEX	I don't know.
EDITOR	Don't know what?
ALEX	Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?

ALEX	Is this being recorded?
MCCALL	This is just an informal discussion.
ALEX	Are you recording it?
MCCALL	What does it look like?
ALEX	It looks like he's writing everything down.
MCCALL	That's because he is. Does that upset you?
ALEX	No. Why should it?
MCCALL	Well, then?
ALEX	I've never seen any of these men before.
MCCALL	Take another look at these two.
ALEX	I don't know them.
MCCALL	And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
ALEX	Yes, I suppose so.

ALEX	Well, is it?
MCCALL	What?
ALEX	Parked outside?
MCCALL	No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.

MCCALL	That's it, then.
ALEX	That's all?
MCCALL	Sorry to waste your time.
ALEX	Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
MCCALL	Just one thing.
ALEX	Yes.

ALEX	What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
MCCALL	I see.

ALEX	Right.
MCCALL	Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.

CAMERON	That's right.
ALEX	What?

ALEX	Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
CAMERON	Yes, thanks.
ALEX	Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
CAMERON	Yes.
ALEX	And you like it?
CAMERON	Oh, yes, it's great.
ALEX	Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
CAMERON	Yes.
ALEX	Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
CAMERON	Well, yes.
ALEX	So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?

CAMERON	What?
ALEX	Nothing. We thought you were someone else.

JULIET	Cameron.
ALEX	Cameron?
JULIET	Yes.
ALEX	Really?

ALEX	When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
JULIET	I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?

ALEX	When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
JULIET	Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?

ALEX	And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
JULIET	OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.

ALEX	Did you know --
JULIET	Just serve.

JULIET	I thought you stopped going.
ALEX	Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.

ALEX	God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
JULIET	Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
ALEX	For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
JULIET	For the flat.
ALEX	No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
JULIET	She hated you --
ALEX	Well, she had problems --
JULIET	-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
ALEX	-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?

ALEX	Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
JULIET	He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.

JULIET	Who was it?
ALEX	I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.

JULIET	So we'll meet him, then?
ALEX	What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'

ALEX	Aroused and inflamed.
JULIET	Alex.
ALEX	He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.

ALEX	I'm not usually drunk.
JULIET	Not usually this drunk.

JULIET	In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
ALEX	It was you, Juliet, it was you --
JULIET	-- instead of what he is --
ALEX	What I am.
JULIET	-- which is --
ALEX	-- which is a hack.
JULIET	The man we know and love.
ALEX	A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
ALEX	Know and love?
JULIET	Yeah.
ALEX	I think you're lying.
JULIET	You're right.
ALEX	You see, they don't really know me.
JULIET	No, Alex, we don't really love you.

JULIET	Have you seen Hugo?
ALEX	No. Any idea which channel he's on?

ALEX	David hasn't seen him either.
JULIET	So I gathered.
ALEX	Maybe he didn't like us.
JULIET	David?
ALEX	Hugo.
JULIET	His car's still there.
ALEX	He's got a car?
JULIET	So what's wrong with that?
ALEX	What sort of car?
JULIET	Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
ALEX	I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
JULIET	A blue one, OK. And it's still there.

ALEX	Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
JULIET	Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
ALEX	So?
JULIET	Open it.
ALEX	You want me to kick it open?
JULIET	Yes.
ALEX	Now?
JULIET	Yes.
ALEX	All right. No problem.

ALEX	I wonder how he did it?
JULIET	Did what?
ALEX	I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?

JULIET	Alex.
ALEX	What? What's wrong?
JULIET	What are you doing?
ALEX	I'm just looking.
JULIET	Don't.
ALEX	Don't look?
JULIET	No.
ALEX	Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
JULIET	No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
ALEX	It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
JULIET	Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
ALEX	Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.

JULIET	No, Alex. It's, it's --
ALEX	What?
JULIET	Unfeasible.
ALEX	Is that all?

JULIET	Who's going to do it?
ALEX	I thought we all were.
JULIET	I don't thinkI can.
ALEX	But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
JULIET	I don't want to. It's different.
ALEX	And now you tell me.

ALEX	Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
JULIET	OK.
ALEX	David?

JULIET	Be careful.
ALEX	Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
JULIET	Stop nagging.
ALEX	I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.

JULIET	Sshh.
ALEX	I want my money back. Excuse me.

ALEX	Love and happiness for ever.
JULIET	For ever and ever.

JULIET	David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
ALEX	It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.

ALEX	Look over there. It's Cameron.
JULIET	Who?
ALEX	Cameron. You remember Cameron.
JULIET	No, I don't.
ALEX	What's he doing here?
JULIET	That's not him.
ALEX	Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!

JULIET	Well, you certainly had a good look around.
ALEX	You were magnificent.

JULIET	Hello. Hello.
ALEX	Who was it?
JULIET	Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
JULIET	Are you all right?
ALEX	No.
JULIET	Then let's spend some money.

ALEX	Will you calm down.
JULIET	Yeah, you're making us all nervous.

JULIET	Is this the same stuff you made last week?
ALEX	No, no, it's different.
JULIET	I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
ALEX	It tastes different.
JULIET	I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!

ALEX	You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
JULIET	He's right. You'd feel much better about it.

ALEX	Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
JULIET	Be like a weight off your shoulders.
ALEX	You know we're right.
JULIET	Don't you?

JULIET	I don't see the point in that.
ALEX	Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --

JULIET	Leave him alone.
ALEX	He can't stay up there.
JULIET	He'll come down. Leave him alone.
ALEX	Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
JULIET	No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
ALEX	Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.

ALEX	Boy, am I glad to see you.
JULIET	What are you doing here?
ALEX	We have to talk.
JULIET	Your painful groin?

ALEX	Later. But first -- him.
JULIET	David?
ALEX	Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
JULIET	Oh, good.
ALEX	He won't do anything for me, but for you --
JULIET	Forget it.
ALEX	He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
JULIET	And the money?
ALEX	We could put it somewhere.
JULIET	Where he can't get it?
ALEX	Now you thought of that, not me.
JULIET	Forget it -- he'll come down.

ALEX	Expecting anyone?
JULIET	No.
ALEX	Oh.

JULIET	Aren't you going to answer it?
ALEX	Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

ALEX	No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
JULIET	It's the only way.
ALEX	I refuse.
JULIET	You're frightened.
ALEX	No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.

ALEX	You'll wait in the hall?
JULIET	I'll wait there.
ALEX	And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
JULIET	Everything.
ALEX	Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
JULIET	Alex.
ALEX	What?
JULIET	As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.

ALEX	Are you all right?
JULIET	Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?

ALEX	I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
JULIET	We were just sorting things out.

ALEX	Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
JULIET	Oh, shut up, Alex.

JULIET	It makes us feel a whole lot better.
ALEX	That's what I thought he said.

JULIET	It's about me and David.
ALEX	The perfect couple, I should say.
JULIET	You mustn't take it so badly.
ALEX	Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
JULIET	Don't you ever stop?
ALEX	No.

JULIET	Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
ALEX	Let him go. Let him take it all.

ALEX	Interesting.
HUGO	I see.
ALEX	Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.

ALEX	So, uh...
HUGO	What?
ALEX	What?
HUGO	You were going to say something.
ALEX	What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?

ALEX	It's OK. There's no problem.
HUGO	You mean I can have the room?
ALEX	Well, that's what I said, isn't it?

ALEX	Can you afford this place?
HUGO	Yeah.

MCCALL	Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
DAVID	What about?
MCCALL	It's about the burglary.
DAVID	Burglary?
MCCALL	Downstairs.
DAVID	Of course.
MCCALL	Can we come in?

DAVID	So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
MCCALL	did you hear anything before he cries?
DAVID	No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
MCCALL	Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
DAVID	No, nothing, sorry.
MCCALL	Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
DAVID	Of course.
MCCALL	And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
DAVID	There are only two other people in the flat.

MCCALL	Two?
DAVID	Who said there were four?
MCCALL	We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
DAVID	No, three. Who said there were four?
MCCALL	How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
DAVID	Yes, absolutely.
MCCALL	Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?

DAVID	I see.
MCCALL	I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
DAVID	No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
MCCALL	Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
DAVID	I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.

MCCALL	Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
DAVID	Someone lost the key.

MCCALL	Is this where no one stays?
DAVID	Yeah, that's right, that's it.

DAVID	No, I've never seen them.
MCCALL	You're sure of that.
DAVID	Yes.
MCCALL	That wasn't a question.

JULIET	Why do you want a room here?
DAVID	Do you smoke?

JULIET	Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
DAVID	OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.

JULIET	It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
DAVID	Did you ever kill a man?

JULIET	Just get on with it, Alex.
DAVID	Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.

DAVID	Is this what they always look like?
JULIET	Yes.

DAVID	I've never seen a dead body before.
JULIET	Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.

JULIET	Are you all right?
DAVID	Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
JULIET	Would you like to talk about it?
DAVID	No.

DAVID	Do you know many of these people?
JULIET	Yes. They're my friends.

JULIET	Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
DAVID	I'm sorry.
JULIET	It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
DAVID	That was stressful. I found that stressful.

JULIET	Two hundred.
DAVID	Two hundred pounds?
JULIET	Two hundred pounds.
DAVID	You paid two hundred pounds for this?
JULIET	That's what it cost, David.
DAVID	No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.

DAVID	Expecting anyone?
JULIET	What?
DAVID	Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
JULIET	No.
DAVID	Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
JULIET	No one. I promise.
DAVID	Who have you talked to?
JULIET	No one.
DAVID	If I think you're lying --

DAVID	I thought you'd gone to work.
JULIET	With a face like this?

DAVID	I'm sorry.
JULIET	I should hope so.

DAVID	We already know. All about it.
JULIET	It was on the television.

JULIET	So let's go.
DAVID	You and me?

JULIET	Yes.
DAVID	And you need your sleep.

JULIET	Eh, I don't know.
DAVID	Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
JULIET	What?
DAVID	That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.

DAVID	But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
JULIET	It wasn't like that.
DAVID	Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.

LUMSDEN	What do we do here, David?
DAVID	Sorry?
LUMSDEN	Here.
DAVID	Right here?
LUMSDEN	In this firm.
DAVID	Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
LUMSDEN	Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
DAVID	Exactly what I was --
LUMSDEN	-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
DAVID	Not any real sneering as such, no.
LUMSDEN	There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
DAVID	Eh --
LUMSDEN	But they sneer, don't they?
DAVID	I'm not sure --
LUMSDEN	Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
DAVID	Yes, sir.
LUMSDEN	And that's why I think you fit in here.
DAVID	I'm boring?
LUMSDEN	You get the job done.
DAVID	Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
LUMSDEN	Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.

JULIET	Hello.
DOCTOR	What happened to that guy?
JULIET	What guy?
DOCTOR	That guy, the one that died.

JULIET	What guy that died?
DOCTOR	That one, last week.
JULIET	Here?.
DOCTOR	Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
JULIET	Oh, him. Well, he died.
DOCTOR	That's what I thought.

JULIET	You must be Hugo.
HUGO	You must be Juliet.
JULIET	Would you like to come in?
HUGO	I'd be delighted.

HUGO	It's nice.
JULIET	Would you like to see the rest?

JULIET	What do you do?
HUGO	Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
JULIET	What's it about?
HUGO	A priest who dies.
JULIET	I see.
HUGO	Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
JULIET	No.
HUGO	Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
JULIET	Writing seems easy.
HUGO	It's a breeze.

JULIET	Do you think you could answer that?
HUGO	The telephone? It continues to ring.
JULIET	Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
JULIET	No.
HUGO	All right.

HUGO	It was some guy called Brian.
JULIET	Did he sound upset?
HUGO	A little bit. Is that good or bad?
JULIET	It's an improvement.

HUGO	Shall I answer it?
JULIET	No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.

HUGO	Working nights?
JULIET	I'm a doctor.
HUGO	And he's a patient of yours?
JULIET	No. But he needs treatment.
HUGO	For what?
JULIET	A certain weakness.
HUGO	The human condition.
JULIET	You know about it?
HUGO	I write about it?
JULIET	And that's not the same thing?
HUGO	No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.

SALESMAN	October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
JULIET	That sounds fine.
SALESMAN	Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
JULIET	What?
SALESMAN	Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
JULIET	Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
SALESMAN	It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
JULIET	The first one was fine.
SALESMAN	Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?

MCCALL	Take all the time you like, doctor.
JULIET	I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
MCCALL	Look again if you like.

JULIET	No. I haven't seen them.
MCCALL	Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
JULIET	Same as everyone else.
MCCALL	But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
JULIET	Yes.
MCCALL	And what do you recognize, names or faces?
JULIET	Diseases.
MCCALL	Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
JULIET	I suppose so.
MCCALL	I mean, that's what it's like.
JULIET	Sorry?
MCCALL	And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.

MITCHELL	Both, sir.
MCCALL	Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.

MITCHELL	Offering it for debate.
MCCALL	It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.

MITCHELL	You can tell by the intonation.
MCCALL	One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?

MCCALL	Your watch.
MITCHELL	Is it real?
MCCALL	Or a fake?

CAL	Evening, Annie.
ANN	Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?

ANN	Cal...
CAL	Annie...got an umbrella...?
ANN	Nope.

ANN	Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.

JOE	...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
ANN	Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.

ANN	Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
JOE	I need a typewritter.
ANN	We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.

JOE	I want to rent this one.
ANN	Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
JOE	I have one, but they lost it.
ANN	Who?
JOE	The people in New Hampshire.
ANN	That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
JOE	Well, it had sentimental value.
ANN	You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
JOE	Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
ANN	You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
JOE	You haven't heard of it.
ANN	What's it called?
JOE	Anguish.

JOE	So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
ANN	I beg your pardon?

JOE	I quit.
ANN	You quit.
JOE	I quit the movie.
ANN	Why did you quit?
JOE	Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
ANN	Don't be so hard on yourself.
JOE	I just got kicked off my first movie.
ANN	Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
JOE	That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
ANN	It's in your play.

JOE	You like my play.
ANN	Yes.
JOE	Why?
ANN	It's about life.
JOE	Could you tell me when's the next train?
ANN	N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?

ANN	No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
JOE	It's about a man who gets a second chance.

JOE	I...
ANN	No, of course, you want to get out of town.
JOE	It's...

JOE	Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
ANN	First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
JOE	But why the dalmation?
ANN	It was either that, or a sardine.

ANN	You get what you pay for.
JOE	That's true.  You grow up here?
ANN	Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.

JOE	...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
ANN	Yes.
JOE	That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
ANN	Yes...
JOE	But, but but but...
ANN	No, no, I see...
JOE	That: in an act of...
ANN	Yes...
JOE	Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
ANN	I understand...
JOE	...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
ANN	As the Old Mill goes around...
JOE	Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
ANN	Of course.
JOE	...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
ANN	That's that's that's that's beautiful...
JOE	And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.

ANN	Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
JOE	And likewise.
ANN	Goodbye.
JOE	Goodbye.

ANN	So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
JOE	No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
ANN	That whole...

JOE	The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
ANN	Everyday things...yes.
JOE	For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
ANN	I live there.
JOE	Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
ANN	Surest thing you know.

JOE	I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
ANN	That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...

JOE	...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
ANN	...I always thought so...

JOE	...such a pleasant sound.
ANN	Mmm.
JOE	Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
ANN	Yes...
JOE	...that.

ANN	...who...?
JOE	Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
ANN	Mister White is...

JOE	Hi.
ANN	What are you doing?  I love your script.
JOE	They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
ANN	You're still here.
JOE	I...I decided to give it another chhh...
ANN	I love your script.

JOE	In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
ANN	You'd know better'n me.
JOE	How can you <u>say</u> that?
ANN	It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
JOE	I <u>can</u>?
ANN	You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
JOE	But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
ANN	Well, first, you got to change the title...

JOE	What I need to <u>say</u>...
ANN	<u>Yes</u>...
JOE	About <u>conflict</u>...
ANN	That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
JOE	...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
ANN	The <u>Firehouse</u>...
JOE	I...
ANN	But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
JOE	<u>How</u>...?
ANN	Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
JOE	No, I don't...
ANN	He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...

ANN	This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
JOE	What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
ANN	Me?
JOE	Yes.

ANN	Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
JOE	...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.

ANN	Hello.
JOE	I thought you had Play Practice.
ANN	Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
JOE	Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
ANN	That's for sure.

JOE	What happened?
ANN	Cast stood me up.
JOE	Uh huh.
ANN	They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.

ANN	Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice.
JOE	What?
ANN	What are you doing down there?
JOE	My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
ANN	...lost the screw...
JOE	You got a paperclip?

JOE	You like kids?
ANN	Never saw the point of 'em.
JOE	Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
ANN	Paperclip?
JOE	Fix my glasses.
ANN	Better idea...

JOE	Gonna' be good as new.
ANN	Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?

JOE	Great.  Who is it...?
ANN	Room Service!
JOE	Would you go in...

JOE	Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
ANN	You have to sign for it.

ANN	I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
JOE	Oh, God...
ANN	And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
JOE	I don't drink.
ANN	It's for your finger.
JOE	One moment.

JOE	Hi.
ANN	You going to ask me in?

JOE	Thank you.
ANN	Read the card.
JOE	To the love of my life, Love, Doug?
ANN	The other side.
JOE	Oh.

ANN	Don't you think you should put them in water?
JOE	Why?
ANN	...because if you don't, they die...

JOE	Start?  This isn't a good time.
ANN	Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
JOE	Later on.
ANN	Then I'll come back, then.
JOE	You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
ANN	No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.

ANN	You can do it.
JOE	Because I'd met someone else.
ANN	Oh <u>okay</u>.
JOE	You believe that?
ANN	I do if you do.

JOE	But it's absurd.
ANN	So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
JOE	Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
ANN	I used to go out with a politician.
JOE	You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
ANN	Sure did.
JOE	Why?
ANN	Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
JOE	Yes.
ANN	Go you Huskies!

ANN	Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
JOE	I can't get it to come out right.
ANN	What's the scene...
JOE	It used to be the Old Mill.
ANN	What've you got?
JOE	They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.

ANN	What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
JOE	<u>Please</u>...
ANN	How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him.  She takes his hand...

JOE	Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
ANN	I hurt you?

ANN	...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
JOE	She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
ANN	...yes.
JOE	...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
ANN	...yes.
JOE	Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...

ANN	Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
JOE	That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
ANN	That's right...
JOE	...take <u>any</u> two people...

JOE	Hi.
ANN	Hi.
JOE	Where you going?
ANN	Going home.

JOE	Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
ANN	What?
JOE	I told them what you said about the script...

ANN	I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
JOE	...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
ANN	No, that's true.
JOE	No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?

ANN	Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
JOE	Is it...
ANN	Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.

ANN	Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
JOE	I'd love to.

ANN	How's your star?
JOE	Gosh, you look nice.
ANN	...what...?

JOE	What would you do with it, the printshop...
ANN	Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...

ANN	Press still works.
JOE	It does?
ANN	Did as of last week.

ANN	Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
JOE	You'd do the newspaper right here.
ANN	That's something a man could do...?
JOE	You know what else a man can do?
ANN	What?

JOE	Pelting down out there.
ANN	People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...

JOE	Good morning.
ANN	Sleep well?
JOE	Yeah, you?
ANN	Oh yeah.
JOE	I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
ANN	Yes...
JOE	We could live up here, live up in the country.
ANN	Now you're talking...
JOE	...and we could get up every morning...
ANN	...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
JOE	And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
ANN	...the better to eat me with, your dear?
JOE	To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
ANN	Not without a rolltop desk.
JOE	Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
ANN	Happen to know where there's one for sale.
JOE	Well ain't you amazing.

ANN	Lookit that, up already.
JOE	That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.

ANN	What is it all about?
JOE	I saw...

JOE	What am I gonna do?
ANN	You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?

CLAIRE	Don't let me dis...I'll just...
WALT	No, no...Please.

WALT	This is Joe White.
CLAIRE	How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...

CLAIRE	What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
WALT	Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
CLAIRE	How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
WALT	Yeah.
CLAIRE	This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
WALT	Yes, yes, but...
CLAIRE	...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go.
WALT	Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...

WALT	What...?
CLAIRE	I can't do it, Walt.
WALT	You can't do what?
CLAIRE	It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
WALT	<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
CLAIRE	I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
WALT	I know that...
CLAIRE	Is...Is the Movie!

WALT	I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
CLAIRE	Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
WALT	...<u>no</u>, they don't...
CLAIRE	...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
WALT	Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.

WALT	Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
CLAIRE	I...I...
WALT	Who are these from?

CLAIRE	...I can't do it, Wally...
WALT	Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
CLAIRE	What?
WALT	Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
CLAIRE	...I...
WALT	Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.

WALT	...I know...I know...
CLAIRE	...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
WALT	No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.

CLAIRE	Wally...
WALT	I know, I know.

WALT	I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
CLAIRE	...yes...
WALT	...wants a piece...
CLAIRE	Yes.
WALT	And you know what...?
CLAIRE	We, we have to give it.
WALT	...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...

WALT	Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
CLAIRE	What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
WALT	I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
CLAIRE	I...
WALT	An artist of your caliber...
CLAIRE	I'm only trying to...
WALT	I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
CLAIRE	The minute I read that script I said...
WALT	I know...
CLAIRE	...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
WALT	...yes...
CLAIRE	...she has a <u>home</u>...
WALT	...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
CLAIRE	He treated me as if I were a child...
WALT	Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
CLAIRE	I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.

CLAIRE	Hello.
WALT	...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
CLAIRE	Bob are you alright...?

CLAIRE	I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
WALT	Well, Joe said it, and he's right.

CLAIRE	No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
WALT	Marty...

WALT	Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in...
CLERK	I'll put the, in your r...
WALT	Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?

WALT	That's cor...
CLERK	He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
WALT	Put something in his room.  What does he like?

WALT	You show Claire these sketches?
COSTUME DESIGNER	Yes.
WALT	Did she throw up?
COSTUME DESIGNER	That isn't very nice.
WALT	Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
COSTUME DESIGNER	I can't tell.
WALT	Why not?
COSTUME DESIGNER	She won't stop crying...
WALT	Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.

COSTUME DESIGNER	She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
WALT	She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
COSTUME DESIGNER	-- she's got 'religion.'
WALT	Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...

Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
DOC WILSON	It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?

JOE	Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?

MARTY	Hi.
DOUG	I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
MARTY	I...
DOUG	...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.

DOUG	What's in the case?
MARTY	Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.

DOUG	And what was it you wanted to say?
MARTY	Gut Yuntif.

FIRST A.D.	I'm looking for the writer.
DOUG	What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
FIRST A.D.	My wife's going to have a baby.
DOUG	How about that.
FIRST A.D.	Mmmm.  You have children?
DOUG	No.  No, but we're planning to.
FIRST A.D.	Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
DOUG	Yes.

DOUG	Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
FIRST A.D.	My wife just went into labor...

DOUG	Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
FIRST A.D.	He should be put in jail.
DOUG	Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
FIRST A.D.	You should.
DOUG	I had a witness I would.
FIRST A.D.	A witness to what...?
DOUG	You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
FIRST A.D.	You mean <u>with White</u>...?
DOUG	What?
FIRST A.D.	You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
DOUG	Who's White...?
FIRST A.D.	The writer.
DOUG	He saw the accident...?
FIRST A.D.	Sure.
DOUG	He saw the girl in the car...
FIRST A.D.	You bet he did.

FIRST A.D.	We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
WALT	Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.

FIRST A.D.	We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
WALT	I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
FIRST A.D.	It burnt down.

WALT	You told me they had an Old Mill here..
FIRST A.D.	Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of...

FIRST A.D.	Town's out of lilacs.
WALT	You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?

WALT	That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
FIRST A.D.	I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.

FIRST A.D.	I...
WALT	Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
FIRST A.D.	I...
WALT	We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
FIRST A.D.	I'm very sorry I...
WALT	You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?

WALT	...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
FIRST A.D.	I can't find the writer.
WALT	...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
FIRST A.D.	I have to talk to you.  My wife...
WALT	Not now.
FIRST A.D.	My wife is going to have a baby, and...
WALT	Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.

FIRST A.D.	I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
WALT	Did you, where are we going tonight...?
FIRST A.D.	I...?
WALT	Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
FIRST A.D.	My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
WALT	You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
FIRST A.D.	I...

WALT	Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
JOE	I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
WALT	We can't shoot the Old Mill.
JOE	You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...

WALT	We're out of money.
JOE	You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...

WALT	Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
JOE	I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
WALT	Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
JOE	I can only write on a manual.
WALT	I know the feeling.
JOE	Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
WALT	Grace...
JOE	That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
WALT	Grace.  Get Mr. White a manual typewriter.  It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.

WALT	Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
JOE	I grew up on your mov...

JOE	It's about a man who gets a second chance.
WALT	Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...

JOE	I want to make a good film.
WALT	I know you do.
JOE	And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
WALT	Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
JOE	Um, no.

WALT	Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
JOE	I don't drink.
WALT	Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...

JOE	What's the...
WALT	Where have you been...?

JOE	I can't.
WALT	Why?

WALT	Why?
JOE	I hurt my finger.
WALT	Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.

JOE	The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
WALT	...she keeps her back to the camera...?

WALT	Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
JOE	I'm gonna nail it.
WALT	I know you are.  Go you Huskies.

JOE	I've got a date.
WALT	He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!

WALT	Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
JOE	You want me to lie.
WALT	To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.

WALT	Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
JOE	I'm out.
WALT	I don't getcha.
JOE	The girl was in the car.
WALT	I treated you like a son or nephew.
JOE	It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
WALT	No, what is it?
JOE	I have to tell the truth.
WALT	...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
JOE	The girl was in the car.
WALT	Then you're finished in show business.
JOE	So be it.
WALT	And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
JOE	For what cause?
WALT	I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.

JOE	Hi!
MARTY	Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...

MARTY	<u>Siddown</u>!
JOE	I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
MARTY	...would you excuse me, please...

MARTY	Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
JOE	I...
MARTY	He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now:

MARTY	You can't write it?
JOE	I can write it.  I can't type it.

JOE	She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
MARTY	The breasts symbolize motherhood...

MARTY	How do they know that, you told them?
JOE	No.
MARTY	What did you say to them...?
JOE	I didn't say anything to them.
MARTY	How do you know you saw it?
JOE	I don't know.
MARTY	Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
JOE	I don't...
MARTY	You didn't see it...
JOE	I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
MARTY	You were there.  At...at 10:35...?

JOE	I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
MARTY	What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
JOE	I...
MARTY	You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?

MARTY	What is that...?
SHERRY	...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
MARTY	It's lovely.
SHERRY	A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
MARTY	My oh my.
SHERRY	I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...

MARTY	You cool the broad out?
WALT	I left that for you.
MARTY	That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?

WALT	Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
MARTY	What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
WALT	How was your flight?
MARTY	We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
WALT	Did you bring Bob's weights?
MARTY	They're coming Fedex...
WALT	What's in all the bags?
MARTY	My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
WALT	I'm gonna' bring it off.
MARTY	55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...

MARTY	<u>Stop</u>...
WALT	That's what I said.
MARTY	How are you getting on with these fine people?
WALT	Like dykes and dogs.

WALT	Marty...
MARTY	Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright?  We need a new title, we need a...

WALT	It's just a formality.
MARTY	That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...

MARTY	Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
WALT	<u>Pay</u> her.
MARTY	I don't got the money.
WALT	Find the money.
MARTY	I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
WALT	No no no no no no no no no find me the money...

WALT	Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
MARTY	She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
WALT	Pay her off.
MARTY	We don't have the money.
WALT	<u>Find</u> it.
MARTY	If you do the product placement...
WALT	IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
MARTY	Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com.
WALT	I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
MARTY	Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
WALT	NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
MARTY	Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:

MARTY	We got the permit.
WALT	Is that one hell of a kid?
MARTY	He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
WALT	He's got a gift for fiction.
MARTY	We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.

WALT	She wasn't in...you were al...
MARTY	There's no witnesses...
WALT	No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?

MARTY	Yeah?
WALT	Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...

MARTY	Wally...?
WALT	Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...

MARTY	Mmm.
WALT	That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
MARTY	Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?

WALT	Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
MARTY	Is he cool or angry?

WALT	Do something.
MARTY	You tell me what to do, I'll do it.

SHERRY	The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
MAYOR	...not the Lazyboy...

MAYOR	...we don't have thirteen at table...
SHERRY	Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
MAYOR	Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
SHERRY	I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
MAYOR	Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...

SHERRY	Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
MAYOR	Sherry, this...

SHERRY	I've got two days to get this house...
MAYOR	Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
SHERRY	I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...

SHERRY	Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
MAYOR	I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
SHERRY	I want them thrown in jail.
MAYOR	Sherry, Sherry...

WALT	I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
MAYOR	And we're glad to have you here...
WALT	My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
MAYOR	Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
WALT	Why would they be illegal?

MAYOR	Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
WALT	That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
MAYOR	...not at all...
WALT	...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
MAYOR	<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
WALT	...the city council...
MAYOR	On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
WALT	...it is?
MAYOR	I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
WALT	George, that is so kind of you.
MAYOR	And, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house.  I don't mean to be...

MAYOR	Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
WALT	So we just got lucky.

MORRIS	You hear that?
SPUD	Yes, I hear it.
MORRIS	Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
SPUD	I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."

MORRIS	...the damn thing...
SPUD	No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...

MORRIS	He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
SPUD	Mmm...

MORRIS	She coulda done better than him.
SPUD	It takes all kinds.
MORRIS	Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...

MORRIS	Assembly of Death did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
SPUD	Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
MORRIS	You think so?
SPUD	Waal, what was the per-screen average...?

SPUD	You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
MORRIS	He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
SPUD	I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
MORRIS	Bet you did.
SPUD	But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
MORRIS	Ain't no second chances in life.
SPUD	Zat true?
MORRIS	Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...

UBERTO	Where are we?
WALT	Givvem a cigarette...

UBERTO	We have to lose the window.
WALT	...we can't lose the wind...
UBERTO	Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?

WALT	We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
UBERTO	Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...

WALT	Why?
UBERTO	Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
WALT	No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
UBERTO	But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
WALT	I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.

BEN	Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
ANNABELLE	I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!

BEN	I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
ANNABELLE	I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.

BEN	&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
ANNABELLE	I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.

ANNABELLE	Ben!  What's wrong?
BEN	I killed her!

ANNABELLE	Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
BEN	I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.

ANNABELLE	So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
BEN	Mommy's marrying Rache!

BEN	I'd rather be with Mommy.
ANNABELLE	She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!

JACKIE	...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
ANNABELLE	I don't care.
JACKIE	I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.

JACKIE	<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
ANNABELLE	I hate when you say that.
JACKIE	Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.

ANNABELLE	I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
JACKIE	Excellent point.

ANNABELLE	I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
JACKIE	Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
ANNABELLE	I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
JACKIE	Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
ANNABELLE	Mass hysteria.
JACKIE	Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
ANNABELLE	I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
JACKIE	Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...

ANNABELLE	Like who?
JACKIE	Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.

ANNABELLE	It just slipped out.
JACKIE	It happens.
ANNABELLE	What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
JACKIE	That will never happen.
ANNABELLE	Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.

ANNABELLE	I'm gonna call him.
JACKIE	Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...

JACKIE	Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
ANNABELLE	I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...

JACKIE	Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
ANNABELLE	Sex.  Of course.

JACKIE	Well, not exactly s...
ANNABELLE	Why does Rachel scream?

JACKIE	Scream.
ANNABELLE	During sex.

JACKIE	How would you know sh...
ANNABELLE	I live.  In the same country.

ANNABELLE	Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
JACKIE	...why do you think?
ANNABELLE	Because it feels really incredibly good.

JACKIE	So why are you asking me?
ANNABELLE	I like talking about it.  At least, to you.

JACKIE	Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
ANNABELLE	What are you gonna talk about?
JACKIE	Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
ANNABELLE	Then why are you putting on mascara?
JACKIE	I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
ANNABELLE	But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
JACKIE	Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
ANNABELLE	Or blush.  You look pale.

JACKIE	Look she's upset --
ANNABELLE	No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
JACKIE	Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.

JACKIE	But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.
ANNABELLE	Like how?
JACKIE	Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.

JACKIE	That happens.  To families.
ANNABELLE	I'll be there for you.

ANNABELLE	Wow.  Who's that for?
JACKIE	Well.  It's for you.

JACKIE	I hope it's the right kind.
ANNABELLE	Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!

ANNABELLE	...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
JACKIE	Like a big sister.
ANNABELLE	She knows every neat junk food place.

ANNABELLE	Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
JACKIE	I bet.

ANNABELLE	And don't tell her I told you.
JACKIE	Secret's safe with me.

JACKIE	I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
ANNABELLE	You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!

JACKIE	We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
ANNABELLE	Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!

JACKIE	I can't hear you.
ANNABELLE	THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!

ANNABELLE	I said...
JACKIE	...I'm not deaf, y'know.

ANNABELLE	He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
JACKIE	And...?

ANNABELLE	She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
JACKIE	She is but an arriviste.

JACKIE	What's Thursd...
ANNABELLE	A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
JACKIE	I could help with the debate.
ANNABELLE	Great.
JACKIE	Actually.  I could only help him.
ANNABELLE	Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
JACKIE	You don't like his friends.
ANNABELLE	...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.

JACKIE	You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
ANNABELLE	Not with my mouth open.
JACKIE	Good girl.

JACKIE	And what do you do wh...
ANNABELLE	I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
JACKIE	You have to ignore him.

JACKIE	He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
ANNABELLE	This is a joke, right?

ANNABELLE	This'll work, huh?
JACKIE	Oh, yeh.

JACKIE	How many devilled eggs can you eat?
ANNABELLE	Maybe twenty.

JACKIE	Annabelle...wake up honey...
ANNABELLE	Mom?  What's wrong?
JACKIE	Nothing sweetheart.

JACKIE	Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
ANNABELLE	You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
JACKIE	I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
ANNABELLE	And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
JACKIE	No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.

ANNABELLE	I don't want to say goodbye.
JACKIE	Don't. Take me with you.

JACKIE	Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
ANNABELLE	I'm not.
JACKIE	Let me be the judge of that.

JACKIE	Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
ANNABELLE	Until he's old enough to read.

JACKIE	Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
ANNABELLE	Yes.
JACKIE	Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
ANNABELLE	I'll miss you so much.
JACKIE	Good.  That's very good.

ANNABELLE	You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
RACHEL	I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
ANNABELLE	You lost Ben?!
RACHEL	Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!

ANNABELLE	No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
RACHEL	Here.
ANNABELLE	Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
RACHEL	I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!

ANNABELLE	I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
RACHEL	He's badgering a witness.  Eat.

ANNABELLE	You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
RACHEL	Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.

RACHEL	I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
ANNABELLE	Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!

ANNABELLE	I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
RACHEL	Thank God for that!

RACHEL	What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
ANNABELLE	This is my daddy's house --
RACHEL	This is my house too!
ANNABELLE	And this is my room so get out!

RACHEL	The timing was off -- I need this light.
ANNABELLE	<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
RACHEL	Hold lunch!
ANNABELLE	But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
RACHEL	It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.

RACHEL	Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
ANNABELLE	I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

ANNABELLE	What if he's kidnapped?
RACHEL	He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!

RACHEL	C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
ANNABELLE	Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!

RACHEL	Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
ANNABELLE	MOMMY!

ANNABELLE	It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
RACHEL	See, I...

RACHEL	She still packing for her trip?
ANNABELLE	I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.

ANNABELLE	You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
RACHEL	That's so weak.
ANNABELLE	Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
RACHEL	Honey, she won't d...

RACHEL	Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
ANNABELLE	Why don't you say hello?
RACHEL	Annabelle pick up the phone.
ANNABELLE	Annabelle pick up the phone.
RACHEL	That doesn't bother me.
ANNABELLE	That doesn't bother me.
RACHEL	You think this is funny?
ANNABELLE	You think this is funny?
RACHEL	No.  I think it's ugly.
ANNABELLE	You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
RACHEL	June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
ANNABELLE	Suits me <u>fine</u>!

RACHEL	Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
ANNABELLE	IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!

ANNABELLE	I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
RACHEL	...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.

RACHEL	Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
ANNABELLE	No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.

ANNABELLE	And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
RACHEL	That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...

RACHEL	And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
ANNABELLE	Not use my words, please!
RACHEL	No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.

RACHEL	Help me here...
ANNABELLE	Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
RACHEL	Great.  Big ears, too?
ANNABELLE	No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.

ANNABELLE	Uh.  What is it?
RACHEL	Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
ANNABELLE	In high school.
RACHEL	He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...

RACHEL	The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
ANNABELLE	But Rache...
RACHEL	A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!

LUKE	Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
ANNABELLE	Ice cold water.
LUKE	That's my girl...

ANNABELLE	I hate her.  I really hate her.
LUKE	There you are!
ANNABELLE	Don't take my picture!

ANNABELLE	No they're not.
LUKE	Annabelle put down that camera.

LUKE	Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
ANNABELLE	You owe me a quarter.

LUKE	You do NOT run out on your moth...
ANNABELLE	YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?

LUKE	You know, this horse smells really bad.
ANNABELLE	There's worse things.

LUKE	...your hating me.
ANNABELLE	Cos she loves you.
LUKE	Cos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.

RACHEL	Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
BEN	No.
RACHEL	Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.

BEN	No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
RACHEL	Fine.

BEN	You touched it.
RACHEL	Then have a donut --
BEN	No.
RACHEL	Alright starve.

BEN	But you told us to starve.
RACHEL	Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --

RACHEL	...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
BEN	No!

BEN	Excuse me --
RACHEL	Annabelle let's get something clear.

BEN	I made you some cocoa.  See?
RACHEL	Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.

RACHEL	&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
BEN	Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
RACHEL	Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.

RACHEL	&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
BEN	No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.

RACHEL	&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
BEN	&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
RACHEL	That's nice Ben.

BEN	Are you <u>real</u> mad?
RACHEL	How could I be?  We learned some magic...

BEN	...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
RACHEL	Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
BEN	Dad!  You can talk him into anything!

RACHEL	'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
BEN	Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...

BEN	IS THAT YOU?
RACHEL	IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.

BEN	Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
JACKIE	I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?

JACKIE	I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
BEN	I have lava.
JACKIE	Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.

BEN	Queen of diamonds.
JACKIE	Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.

BEN	Poof!  You're happy now.
JACKIE	Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!

JACKIE	Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
BEN	I knew where I was all the time.

BEN	Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
JACKIE	No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
BEN	Rachel's job is she works.
JACKIE	Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
BEN	Does Rachel make a lot of money?
JACKIE	People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
BEN	I think she's pretty, Mommy.
JACKIE	Yes...if you like big hair...
BEN	Mommy?
JACKIE	What honey?
BEN	If you want me to hate her I will.

BEN	Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
JACKIE	Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
BEN	And many meatballs.

JACKIE	You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
BEN	Is that like Luigi's?

JACKIE	Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
BEN	Where are you, anyway?

JACKIE	I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
BEN	Yes.
JACKIE	Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
BEN	I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
JACKIE	Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.

JACKIE	That I do.  Always will.
BEN	Mom...?

JACKIE	I'm fine, ba...
BEN	Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?

BEN	Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
JACKIE	Thursday's fine...

JACKIE	ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
BEN	Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.

BEN	No.
JACKIE	Pray.  We never find out.

JACKIE	Mommy's sick, guys.
BEN	You have the WORST flu since...
JACKIE	I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?

JACKIE	Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
BEN	Is your bad?

BEN	So you're okay.
JACKIE	I'm still sick, but I'm better.

JACKIE	In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
BEN	That's Rache's song!
JACKIE	Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.

JACKIE	Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
BEN	No!  I have to get there.
JACKIE	Where Ben?
BEN	Before you.
JACKIE	Ben where do you have to get to?
BEN	Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.

JACKIE	Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
BEN	How do you know?
JACKIE	Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
BEN	Oh.

JACKIE	Okay.  These are good.
BEN	I helped.

JACKIE	I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
BEN	Rache can do that part.

JACKIE	Find the bird cage?
BEN	Rache says it's from you.
JACKIE	Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.

JACKIE	So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
BEN	You dying.

JACKIE	If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
BEN	But you can still see him.
JACKIE	Half.  Of him.

JACKIE	The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
BEN	So where are you?

JACKIE	Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
BEN	Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
JACKIE	Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.

BEN	It's not good enough.
JACKIE	No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?

RACHEL	Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
COOPER	You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
RACHEL	You say that like I don't know that.
COOPER	I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
RACHEL	And when did that pass?
COOPER	Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.

COOPER	May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
RACHEL	Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.

JACKIE	People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
DR. SWEIKERT	Every day.  More and more.

JACKIE	So we'll...radiate some more?
DR. SWEIKERT	At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.

JACKIE	That's necessary, huh?
DR. SWEIKERT	Let's take our best shot.

JACKIE	I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
DR. SWEIKERT	Have you still never told him?

JACKIE	Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
DR. SWEIKERT	Sooner than later.  You really need to.

DUNCAN	Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
RACHEL	Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --

RACHEL	It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
DUNCAN	But you're not <u>done</u>!

RACHEL	I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
DUNCAN	We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!

RACHEL	Which part of no don't you understand?
DUNCAN	Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
RACHEL	They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.

DUNCAN	You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
RACHEL	Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...

DUNCAN	You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
RACHEL	No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
DUNCAN	Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!

LUKE	Planning on getting --
JACKIE	Remarried.  There is no move.

JACKIE	Are you here?
LUKE	I'm here.
JACKIE	Because you don't really seem here.
LUKE	I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
JACKIE	Something's up wi...
LUKE	You think I didn't get that?

LUKE	I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
JACKIE	Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
LUKE	Rachel's not half my age.
JACKIE	We're not discussing your age.
LUKE	Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
JACKIE	They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
LUKE	Jackie, they come to be part of my life.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.

LUKE	Napalm.
JACKIE	Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
LUKE	Jackie, she was five minutes late --

LUKE	Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
JACKIE	It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
LUKE	I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
JACKIE	You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...

LUKE	You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
JACKIE	I'm worried.
LUKE	Me too.
JACKIE	Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
LUKE	Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
JACKIE	Easy enough.
LUKE	Good...Well...Take care.

JACKIE	Just outside the big top, we're almo...
LUKE	You're WHERE?
JACKIE	At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
LUKE	Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
JACKIE	...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?

LUKE	Our children.
JACKIE	Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
LUKE	But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
JACKIE	Not to me.
LUKE	Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
JACKIE	I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
LUKE	Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
JACKIE	We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?

JACKIE	Called him.  We set an ap...
LUKE	Don't do this.

JACKIE	You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
LUKE	Partly.  But partly, you're mad.

LUKE	You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
JACKIE	<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.

LUKE	I'm afraid she's going to walk.
JACKIE	And I'm supposed to care.

LUKE	Still, please.
JACKIE	Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
LUKE	Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...

LUKE	I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
JACKIE	Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.

LUKE	I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
JACKIE	Just not to me.

LUKE	It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
JACKIE	To make it easier for them or you?
LUKE	It's a huge moment in their life --
JACKIE	You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
LUKE	We...
JACKIE	WE are over.
LUKE	WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.

LUKE	You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
JACKIE	No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.

JACKIE	The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
LUKE	Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
JACKIE	And we all went through that together?

LUKE	She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
JACKIE	Stop.  You're making me insecure.

JACKIE	It's temporary.
LUKE	It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?

LUKE	You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
JACKIE	Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
LUKE	Yet another spaghetti night.
JACKIE	Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.

JACKIE	I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
LUKE	We're going to win this.
JACKIE	Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.

LUKE	What happens next?
JACKIE	I live or I die.

JACKIE	I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
LUKE	A lot smaller.

JACKIE	How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
RACHEL	This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
JACKIE	Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
RACHEL	Can I please have a cup of coffee?
JACKIE	We don't have any coffee.
RACHEL	What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
JACKIE	Annabelle, how's your video rep...

JACKIE	What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
RACHEL	Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
JACKIE	What did you do?
RACHEL	Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...

RACHEL	She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
JACKIE	...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
RACHEL	<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?

RACHEL	Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
JACKIE	I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
RACHEL	I was in there in him.

JACKIE	Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
RACHEL	No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
JACKIE	You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
RACHEL	You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
JACKIE	Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
RACHEL	Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
JACKIE	Get out!
RACHEL	But it's not on the schedule!
JACKIE	You got to hell!

JACKIE	Machines do not EAT message.
RACHEL	Look, I...
JACKIE	Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.

RACHEL	Yeh?
JACKIE	Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.

JACKIE	Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
RACHEL	I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...

RACHEL	Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
JACKIE	You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.

JACKIE	I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
RACHEL	Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
JACKIE	A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?

RACHEL	...in.
JACKIE	I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
RACHEL	I don't recall inviting you.

RACHEL	I have a snoop.
JACKIE	I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
RACHEL	I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.

RACHEL	She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
JACKIE	You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
RACHEL	I need practice.
JACKIE	Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.

JACKIE	So why did y...
RACHEL	I did it for her.

JACKIE	I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
RACHEL	What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?

JACKIE	However many.  It's not enough.
RACHEL	I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
JACKIE	Fine, forget it.

JACKIE	Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
RACHEL	Why not just bring the whole toilet?
JACKIE	Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
RACHEL	Not personally.
JACKIE	Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?

RACHEL	Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
JACKIE	It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.

RACHEL	I'm sorry, I just...
JACKIE	Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
RACHEL	No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...

RACHEL	What about obsessively picking her split ends?
JACKIE	Anxiety.
RACHEL	Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
JACKIE	She was angry at herself.
RACHEL	Jackie?
JACKIE	Yes?
RACHEL	When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...

RACHEL	You feeling all right?
JACKIE	Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.

JACKIE	...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
RACHEL	Wowie.  How wonderful!

JACKIE	...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
RACHEL	Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.

RACHEL	Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
JACKIE	Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?

JACKIE	I don't know wh...
RACHEL	I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.

JACKIE	My boss.
RACHEL	You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
JACKIE	You WHAT?
RACHEL	You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.

RACHEL	Look, you've never liked me...
JACKIE	Don't flatter yourself.
RACHEL	And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
JACKIE	Nobody likes a snoop.
RACHEL	But I came here to...

JACKIE	Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
RACHEL	We can't live like that.

JACKIE	Did I hear the word...
RACHEL	Luke.  Can't live like that.

JACKIE	Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
RACHEL	...it's my problem, too.

RACHEL	I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
JACKIE	Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?

JACKIE	Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
RACHEL	You're not dying.

RACHEL	You bet you are.
JACKIE	How the hell would you know?
RACHEL	I don't, but...
JACKIE	How would you know <u>anything</u>?

RACHEL	And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
JACKIE	You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!

JACKIE	They came out of my <u>body</u>!
RACHEL	See, I know that.
JACKIE	I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!

RACHEL	Okay, I'm undeserving.
JACKIE	Ironic, huh?

JACKIE	Small world.
RACHEL	Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.

RACHEL	So I have to tell you something in confidence...
JACKIE	You're a cross-dresser.
RACHEL	That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.

JACKIE	She hasn't mentioned this.
RACHEL	She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.

JACKIE	Moi?
RACHEL	Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.

RACHEL	As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
JACKIE	...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
RACHEL	Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'

JACKIE	Oh, my God.
RACHEL	Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
JACKIE	She's devastated.
RACHEL	Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.

JACKIE	And you said...?
RACHEL	Beats me.  Ask your mom.

RACHEL	Can I look at the pictures?
JACKIE	It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.

RACHEL	So.  Hopeful.
JACKIE	It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.

JACKIE	I really look like shit.
RACHEL	You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
JACKIE	Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.

JACKIE	You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
RACHEL	Brad Kovitsky.

JACKIE	The primo stuff is great for pain.
RACHEL	I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'

JACKIE	He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
RACHEL	And you said...
JACKIE	What else?  Keep on keepin' on.

JACKIE	Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
RACHEL	Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
JACKIE	How's she doing with Brad?

RACHEL	Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
JACKIE	Thanks, but it's under control.

RACHEL	Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
JACKIE	It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?

RACHEL	Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
JACKIE	...go to the park.  In the worst way.

JACKIE	I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
RACHEL	No.

RACHEL	It's just not the right time t...
JACKIE	Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
RACHEL	It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
JACKIE	You mean, after I'm dead?

RACHEL	Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
JACKIE	Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
RACHEL	It's the same choice you made.
JACKIE	Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.

JACKIE	I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
RACHEL	I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
JACKIE	That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.

RACHEL	My advice to you?  Don't die.
JACKIE	Feeling the pressure?

JACKIE	Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
RACHEL	And her...?
JACKIE	Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.

RACHEL	That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
JACKIE	Is that what he told you?
RACHEL	He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.

RACHEL	You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
JACKIE	Who in the world <u>is</u> he?

RACHEL	Looks nice enough to m...
JACKIE	He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?

JACKIE	Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
RACHEL	Are we.
JACKIE	And I'm going to win.
RACHEL	Don't be too sure.

JACKIE	Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
RACHEL	It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
JACKIE	Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
RACHEL	Give 'em my number.

JACKIE	Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
RACHEL	Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
JACKIE	You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
RACHEL	Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.

JACKIE	You put filth in my child's mouth.
RACHEL	Aw.
JACKIE	You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
RACHEL	Worked.  Like a charm.

RACHEL	She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
JACKIE	So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.

JACKIE	You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
RACHEL	That's not wh...
JACKIE	You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
RACHEL	You weren't passing 'em out.
JACKIE	Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.

JACKIE	See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
RACHEL	Oh please.
JACKIE	Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.

JACKIE	Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
RACHEL	She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
JACKIE	Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.

JACKIE	And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
RACHEL	And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.

JACKIE	You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
RACHEL	<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.

JACKIE	Thanks for coming out.
RACHEL	Neutral ground.  What's up?

JACKIE	She likes a Stolie, no ice.
RACHEL	Double.

JACKIE	What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
RACHEL	Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.

RACHEL	I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
JACKIE	No, there isn't.
RACHEL	And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.

RACHEL	I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
JACKIE	Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.

RACHEL	Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
JACKIE	Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
RACHEL	Maybe I was wrong on that one.

RACHEL	You're lying.
JACKIE	I lost him.  I was panicked.
RACHEL	You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
JACKIE	I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.

RACHEL	Ben never mentioned it.
JACKIE	He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.

JACKIE	Why didn't I?
RACHEL	Uh.  You hate my guts?

RACHEL	With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
JACKIE	What do I have that you don't?
RACHEL	Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
JACKIE	You're the hip and fresh.
RACHEL	You ride with Annabelle...
JACKIE	You'll learn.
RACHEL	You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
JACKIE	I have their past.

RACHEL	Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
JACKIE	Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.

RACHEL	You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
JACKIE	Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.

RACHEL	Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
LUKE	It was a veal stock, I thi...
RACHEL	Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...

RACHEL	The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
LUKE	We have to talk.
RACHEL	Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
LUKE	I didn't want to spoil our supper...
RACHEL	You'd rather spoil our walk home.
LUKE	Yeh, it's cheaper.

LUKE	I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
RACHEL	So I'll have to order in?
LUKE	We have the kids this weekend, so...
RACHEL	Jesus.

LUKE	Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
RACHEL	For what?
LUKE	Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
RACHEL	I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
LUKE	You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
RACHEL	Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.

RACHEL	You don't trust me to be alone with them.
LUKE	I trust you of course I do but --
RACHEL	But?  But what?
LUKE	But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
RACHEL	I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.

RACHEL	Look.  I know they hate me.
LUKE	They don't hate you --
RACHEL	And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
LUKE	Nobody's telling them to hate you --
RACHEL	Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
LUKE	It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
RACHEL	Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
LUKE	No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
RACHEL	You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.

LUKE	Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
RACHEL	Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
LUKE	Not yet.
RACHEL	Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
LUKE	We have the kids.  Next weekend.
LUKE	And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
RACHEL	Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.

RACHEL	Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
LUKE	Rache, get out of th...
RACHEL	You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...

RACHEL	Oh my God.  Are you serious?
LUKE	I think so...What do you think?
RACHEL	I think so too...

LUKE	It's forever you know.
RACHEL	Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
LUKE	Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.

RACHEL	Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
LUKE	Rache, it may take time.
RACHEL	What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.

LUKE	Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
RACHEL	It's no biggie.

RACHEL	It's just an assignment.
LUKE	It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
RACHEL	Are you hungry?  You could make us something?

LUKE	They're my kids.
RACHEL	Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?

LUKE	She's not gonna die.
RACHEL	I know that.

RACHEL	No problem.
LUKE	I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.

LUKE	What a great surpri...
RACHEL	Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.

RACHEL	Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
LUKE	Well, they will be.
RACHEL	Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?

LUKE	Why in the world would she t...
RACHEL	You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
LUKE	I needed some time away.
RACHEL	...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
LUKE	'...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?

LUKE	She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
RACHEL	What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.

LUKE	Can we go sit somewhere?
RACHEL	Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.

LUKE	I told her I loved her.
RACHEL	By way of saying you were unhappy.
LUKE	Restless.
RACHEL	Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'

LUKE	'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
RACHEL	No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.

LUKE	That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
RACHEL	No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'

RACHEL	'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
LUKE	That's not us.
RACHEL	Because you've changed so much.

LUKE	We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
RACHEL	How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?

LUKE	Where you goin'?
RACHEL	I'm gonna get me a drink.

RACHEL	Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
STACY	Does Jackie know this?
RACHEL	No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
STACY	In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
RACHEL	Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
STACY	Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.

MARTY	I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
BRADY	Maybe he's gay.
MARTY	Don't ever say that.
BRADY	What if he is?
MARTY	He isn't.

MARTY	Out! Leave the table!
BRADY	What?
MARTY	You heard me: leave the table!
BRADY	Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!

BRADY	We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
MARTY	Oh, yeah?

BRADY	Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
MARTY	Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?

BRADY	Hey.
SCOOBY	Hey. What's up?
BRADY	There's something I need to talk about with you.
SCOOBY	What?
BRADY	There are some rumors...
SCOOBY	Like what?
BRADY	You know...Stanley...
SCOOBY	Oh.
BRADY	And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.

SCOOBY	No prob. I'm cool.
BRADY	Thanks, Scoob.

FERN	Marty, ignore him.
BRADY	He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...

FERN	Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
BRADY	He was in a concentration camp?
FERN	Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
BRADY	But I thought he came over to America before the war.
FERN	Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
BRADY	Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
FERN	But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.

CONAN	Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
SCOOBY	Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
CONAN	I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
SCOOBY	I'll be your guest!
CONAN	Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.

CONAN	Welcome to the show, Scooby.
SCOOBY	Thank you.
CONAN	Nice to have you here.
SCOOBY	Great to be here.
CONAN	And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
SCOOBY	Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
CONAN	Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
SCOOBY	Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
CONAN	TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.

MIKEY	Consuelo?
CONSUELO	Yes, Mikey?
MIKEY	Do you have any brothers or sisters?
CONSUELO	Yes.
MIKEY	Really? How many?
CONSUELO	Four brothers and five sisters.
MIKEY	Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
CONSUELO	It was God's will.
MIKEY	But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
CONSUELO	No.

MIKEY	When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
CONSUELO	I did not go to high school.
MIKEY	Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
CONSUELO	We had to work. My family was poor.
MIKEY	Must've been hard being poor.
CONSUELO	I'm still poor.
MIKEY	Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
CONSUELO	No, Mikey.
MIKEY	But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
CONSUELO	I'm always working.
MIKEY	But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
CONSUELO	This is work.
MIKEY	But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.

MIKEY	Consuelo. Are you crying?
CONSUELO	No.
MIKEY	Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
CONSUELO	Mi Jesus
MIKEY	Speak English.
CONSUELO	Mi Jesus esta muerto!
MIKEY	Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
CONSUELO	My Jesus
MIKEY	Who is Jesus?
CONSUELO	My baby.
MIKEY	You have a bay?
CONSUELO	My grandchild-baby.
MIKEY	Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
CONSUELO	He's dead.
MIKEY	Oh. How did it happen?
CONSUELO	He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
MIKEY	How did they execute him?
CONSUELO	Poison gas.
MIKEY	Maybe it's for the best
CONSUELO	Jesus was not bad.
MIKEY	Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
CONSUELO	He wasn't.
MIKEY	But still, you can't be sure.
CONSUELO	I am sure.
MIKEY	But really, you never know.
CONSUELO	I know!
MIKEY	Why was he on Death Row?
CONSUELO	For rape and murder.

MIKEY	Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
CONSUELO	It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.

MIKEY	Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
CONSUELO	Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.

TOBY	So whaddya think?
EDITOR	Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
TOBY	I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
EDITOR	You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
EDITOR	No, you don't.
TOBY	Yes, I do. I love them!

EDITOR	The camerawork's nice.
TOBY	Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.

EDITOR	This is definitely better.
TOBY	You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
EDITOR	This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
TOBY	Yes, I know
EDITOR	I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
TOBY	No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious
EDITOR	You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
TOBY	Nothing, I guess
EDITOR	I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
TOBY	OK, you're right, you're right
EDITOR	I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
TOBY	OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
EDITOR	We're not ready.
TOBY	Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
EDITOR	We're not ready!
TOBY	Well, I need to see this with an audience!
EDITOR	What's an audience going to tell you?
TOBY	I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.

FERN	Don't even joke about that!
MIKEY	I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?

MIKEY	Twinkeys!
FERN	Boys, take napkins...Napkins...

MIKEY	Mom?
FERN	Yes, Mikey?
MIKEY	I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
FERN	What?
MIKEY	550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!

MARTY	Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
FERN	Got a lot of homework?

FERN	Marty...
MARTY	You started filling out your college applications yet?

MARTY	Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
FERN	Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.

MARTY	We used pull.
FERN	You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.

FERN	It's all about who you know.
MARTY	Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
FERN	He's right.

MARTY	Sure!...
FERN	Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.

SCOOBY	Was anyone in my room today?
FERN	Is everything OK?
SCOOBY	My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.

FERN	What are you going to do?
SCOOBY	I dunno.

SCOOBY	We did the same thing last year also.
FERN	How was the class?

FERN	Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
SCOOBY	But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.

FERN	Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
SCOOBY	Fine.
FERN	Ready for tomorrow?
SCOOBY	What's tomorrow?
FERN	The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.

MARCUS	Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
VI	Huh?
MARCUS	I can read it to you.
VI	You mean, again?
MARCUS	Well, I changed the ending a little.
VI	Oh. What happens now?
MARCUS	Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
VI	Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
MARCUS	But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
VI	I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.

MARCUS	So you don't want to hear my new ending?
VI	You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.

MARCUS	You're tired of me. I can tell.
VI	Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
MARCUS	You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
VI	I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
MARCUS	Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.

MARCUS	What do you want?
VI	Don't be so upset. It's OK...
MARCUS	What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
VI	You know he hated my story also.
MARCUS	Your story was terrible!

VI	Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
MARCUS	Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
MARCUS	Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
VI	I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.

MARTY	Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
TOBY	You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.

MARTY	And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
TOBY	Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
MARTY	Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 

MARTY	Reconceive.
TOBY	'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...

TOBY	Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
MARTY	Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?

TOBY	But what kind of pull did you have?
MARTY	I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.

MARTY	I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a
TOBY	...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?

SCOOBY	Fuck!
MARTY	I'm going in there.

SCOOBY	I dunno.
MARTY	Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?

MARTY	What DO you know?
SCOOBY	Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...

MARTY	So? How was school today?
SCOOBY	The same.
MARTY	The same. Same as what?
SCOOBY	Just the same.

MARTY	Get the hell outta here!
SCOOBY	Man, it's just, like, conversation.

MARTY	Scooby?
SCOOBY	Yeah?
MARTY	We have to talk.

SCOOBY	Whaddya wanna talk about?
MARTY	Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.

SCOOBY	OK.
MARTY	Tired of this shit...

MARTY	I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
MIKEY	Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!

MIKEY	Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
MARTY	Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.

MIKEY	Dad?
MARTY	One in a million recover.
MIKEY	Maybe he's that one in a million!
MARTY	Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.

MIKEY	I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
MARTY	Thanks.
MIKEY	You're welcome.  Dad?
MARTY	Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
MIKEY	OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.

MARTY	Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
MIKEY	OK!

MARTY	Hey, Mikey!
MIKEY	Hi, Dad!
MARTY	Come here, give me a hug!
MIKEY	Gee, you're home early!
MARTY	Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
MIKEY	Sure, Dad.

MR SCOTT	Hello, Vi.
VI	What are you doing here?
MR SCOTT	What are you doing here?

VI	I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
MR SCOTT	Well, now you have.

VI	Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
MR SCOTT	Uh huh.
VI	Can I join you?

MR SCOTT	You're not.
VI	Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
MR SCOTT	That's good.
VI	And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.

MR SCOTT	You have beautiful skin.
VI	Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
MR SCOTT	Maybe. She's OK.

VI	Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
MR SCOTT	I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
VI	Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
MR SCOTT	No.
VI	Thank you for being honest.

MR SCOTT	It's over there.
VI	Thanks.

VI	It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
MR SCOTT	Take off your top.

VI	Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
MR SCOTT	Say, Ni...
VI	Ni...
MR SCOTT	...gger.
VI	...gger.
MR SCOTT	Say, 'Nigger.'
VI	Nigger.
MR SCOTT	'Fuck me hard!'
VI	Fuck me hard!
MR SCOTT	Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
VI	Nigger, fuck me hard!
MR SCOTT	Again!
VI	Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
MR SCOTT	Again!!
VI	NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...

SCOOBY	No, not really.
MR. DEMARCO	Any books you like to read for fun?
SCOOBY	No.
MR. DEMARCO	None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
SCOOBY	I hate reading.
MR. DEMARCO	All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
SCOOBY	OK.
MR. DEMARCO	'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
SCOOBY	I dunno...
MR. DEMARCO	C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
SCOOBY	Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
MR. DEMARCO	Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
SCOOBY	I dunno. See if I have any connections.

PAM	Hello?
TOBY	Hello, is this Pam?
PAM	Who is this?
TOBY	Toby Oxman.
PAM	Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
TOBY	Oh, fine. How are you?
PAM	Great!
TOBY	Great!
PAM	So what's going on?
TOBY	That's what I was gonna ask you.
PAM	But...you called.
TOBY	Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
PAM	Yeah.

TOBY	So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
PAM	Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
TOBY	Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
PAM	Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
TOBY	Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.

PAM	I believe it.
TOBY	Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
PAM	Oh, that's too bad.
TOBY	Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
PAM	Anything I might know about?
TOBY	Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
PAM	That's too bad.
TOBY	I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
PAM	That's good. So then what do you do now?
TOBY	I'm a documentary filmmaker.
PAM	Oh? Anything I might have seen?
TOBY	N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
PAM	Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
TOBY	Oh, I don't remember that...
PAM	I do.
TOBY	Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...

TOBY	Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
PAM	Hunh.

PAM	That's good.
TOBY	Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
PAM	Yeah. But not any more.
TOBY	Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?

TOBY	Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
PAM	Yeah.
TOBY	Huh. Kids?
PAM	Yeah.
TOBY	How many?
PAM	Three.
TOBY	Great. How old are they?
PAM	Eight, six, and four.
TOBY	Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!

PAM	Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
TOBY	Yeah, sure.
PAM	OK. Bye.
TOBY	Maybe she has caller ID.

SCOOBY	Pretty cool, Stanley.
STANLEY	Thanks.
SCOOBY	How'd you get it?
STANLEY	It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
SCOOBY	Gee, your Dad's smart.
STANLEY	I know.
SCOOBY	Is it loaded?
STANLEY	No, I don't think so...

STANLEY	Scooby, don't! Be careful!
SCOOBY	I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
STANLEY	I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
SCOOBY	You should be.

STANLEY	Scooby?
SCOOBY	Yeah?
STANLEY	You know...I like you.
SCOOBY	Yeah. I know.
STANLEY	I mean...

SCOOBY	You want some?
STANLEY	No, thanks.

SCOOBY	You a pervert?
TOBY	No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
SCOOBY	Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
TOBY	Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
SCOOBY	What for?
TOBY	Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
SCOOBY	Is this to like get into Sundance?
TOBY	Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
SCOOBY	Doubt it.
TOBY	Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
SCOOBY	Whoopee.
TOBY	HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.

SCOOBY	So like, yeah
TOBY	So where'd you get in?
SCOOBY	Prnceton.
TOBY	But what did you get on your SATs?
SCOOBY	200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.

SCOOBY	Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering
TOBY	Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
SCOOBY	Can I see what you have so far?
TOBY	Sure
SCOOBY	Thanks man.

TOBY	What is most important to you?
SCOOBY	I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.

TOBY	Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
SCOOBY	He did?
TOBY	Yeah. He went to Harward.
SCOOBY	Oh.

TOBY	Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
SCOOBY	Don't be. Your movie's a hit.

JEFF	Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
BEE-BEE	Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
JEFF	I don't know.

BEE-BEE	We are?
JEFF	Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.

BEE-BEE	Mn-hm.
JEFF	Burger Manifesto, Part One is gonna make people think?

BEE-BEE	Um-hm.
JEFF	Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!

JEFF	I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
BEE-BEE	I don't anymore.
JEFF	Can I have some?
BEE-BEE	Knock yourself out.

JEFF	You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
BEE-BEE	Yeah.
JEFF	Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
BEE-BEE	Sure, all the time, in Group.
JEFF	In Group?
BEE-BEE	Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
JEFF	Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
BEE-BEE	Intense.
JEFF	How long were you in there?
BEE-BEE	Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
JEFF	Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
BEE-BEE	No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
JEFF	I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
BEE-BEE	Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
JEFF	It was pretty bad, huh?
BEE-BEE	It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.

JEFF	We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
BEE-BEE	Yeah.
JEFF	Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
BEE-BEE	Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
JEFF	Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
BEE-BEE	Yeah, I guess.
JEFF	You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
BEE-BEE	Mm-hm.
JEFF	You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.

BEE-BEE	That was really great.
SOOZE	Was it okay?
BEE-BEE	Yeah!
SOOZE	What did you guys think?
BEE-BEE	Slides go with it.
SOOZE	Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.

BEE-BEE	It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
SOOZE	Why is everything about you, Jeff?

BEE-BEE	Uh-huh.
SOOZE	I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.

BEE-BEE	Responsibility, progress.
SOOZE	Yes.

BEE-BEE	Typical male.
SOOZE	Typical male.
BEE-BEE	Typical male.
SOOZE	Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?

BEE-BEE	Uh, home, you know.
SOOZE	Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
BEE-BEE	You didn't get me in trouble.

BUFF	Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
BEE-BEE	No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?

BUFF	Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
BEE-BEE	Yeah, when's he coming?

BUFF	Hey!
BEE-BEE	Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
BUFF	No I quit.
BEE-BEE	Hey, you said you did a video?
BUFF	Yup.
BEE-BEE	What's it about?
BUFF	It's really not about anything.
BEE-BEE	Oh. Well, what's it on?
BUFF	A cloud.
BEE-BEE	A cloud?
BUFF	Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
BEE-BEE	Oh.
BUFF	I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
BEE-BEE	Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
BUFF	You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
BEE-BEE	Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
BUFF	Your a nurse?
BEE-BEE	No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
BUFF	Any gunshot victims?
BEE-BEE	Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
BUFF	Sounds like a bummer.
BEE-BEE	Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
BUFF	Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
BEE-BEE	Right now?
BUFF	Yeah.
BEE-BEE	I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
BUFF	Do you wanna go to the van?
BEE-BEE	Now?
BUFF	Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
BEE-BEE	I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
BUFF	Okay, whatever you want.

JEFF	Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
BUFF	Needs some pizza in his diet.

BUFF	Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
JEFF	Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
BUFF	Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
JEFF	You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.

JEFF	Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
BUFF	Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
JEFF	Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
BUFF	And your mom.
JEFF	No, I'm here. Where are you?
BUFF	Where are you-hoo?
JEFF	No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
BUFF	Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
JEFF	Shut up! Aw...

BUFF	Stuck with what guy?
JEFF	What?
BUFF	You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
JEFF	No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
BUFF	It's your birthday?
JEFF	Yeah.
BUFF	Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!

BUFF	But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
JEFF	He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...

BUFF	Pony's coming here to the corner?!
JEFF	Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.

JEFF	I don't know. Later. I don't know.
BUFF	Yes!

JEFF	Don't let 'em fight.
BUFF	The dude wants it.

JEFF	No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
BUFF	That's the rock star thing.
JEFF	No, no.
BUFF	Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
JEFF	Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
BUFF	Sorry.
JEFF	Jesus Christ.
BUFF	You wanna bet he's with a girl?
JEFF	No, he's not with a girl.
BUFF	Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
JEFF	You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
BUFF	Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
JEFF	I'd get bored.
BUFF	I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
JEFF	That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
BUFF	Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
JEFF	That sounds so depressing.
BUFF	Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
JEFF	No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
BUFF	Ah!
JEFF	I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
BUFF	Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
JEFF	Watch out for that tree.

BUFF	A long, long, long, long, while.
JEFF	Okay, okay.
BUFF	A long, long, long...
JEFF	Okay.

JEFF	So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
BUFF	So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.

BUFF	Go!
JEFF	... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!

BUFF	You know what we should do? Go to the...
JEFF	So you can do an album cover?

BUFF	Fuck it!
JEFF	You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
BUFF	In the limo!!!

BUFF	Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
JEFF	No, no.
BUFF	Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.

BUFF	Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
JEFF	No.

BUFF	Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
JEFF	No, no, I wasn't trying.
BUFF	She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
JEFF	No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
BUFF	No. Life is too short.
JEFF	No, I'm not worried.
BUFF	Good.
JEFF	Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
BUFF	Sure.
JEFF	No, I mean, no one.
BUFF	Hey, you know me.
JEFF	Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
BUFF	Yeah.
JEFF	Uh, last night...
BUFF	Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
JEFF	No, no.
BUFF	I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
JEFF	No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
BUFF	Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
JEFF	Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
BUFF	No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
JEFF	No.
BUFF	Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
JEFF	Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
BUFF	But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
JEFF	Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
BUFF	Oh, and guess who showed up.
JEFF	No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
BUFF	I know, man.
JEFF	You know?
BUFF	Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
JEFF	What, they're looking for her?
BUFF	No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
JEFF	Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
BUFF	Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
JEFF	Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
BUFF	Y- s-sure it did.
JEFF	No. It didn't, Buff.
BUFF	Wait. Hey, man.
JEFF	Erica is in the van back there.
BUFF	What?
JEFF	Look.
BUFF	Hey, man.
JEFF	She's in the van.
BUFF	What she doin' in the van, man?
JEFF	Buff...
BUFF	What?
JEFF	She's dead.
BUFF	She's dead?
JEFF	Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
BUFF	Tim...
JEFF	Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
BUFF	Bullshit.
JEFF	No, no, no.
BUFF	That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
JEFF	Oh, really? You wanna go look?
BUFF	Yeah, man.
JEFF	Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
BUFF	It's bullshit. Look! Look!

BUFF	Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
JEFF	Guess not.
BUFF	See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
JEFF	No.
BUFF	God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
JEFF	Alright. 'Bye, Buff.

BUFF	Ah, you know people there?
SOOZE	I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.

BUFF	Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
SOOZE	Jeff! Let's go!

SOOZE	Hey, I'm Sooze.
BUFF	Yeah, right, publicist.

BUFF	Yeah.
SOOZE	Come on.
BUFF	Play it! Come on!

SOOZE	Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
BUFF	Wait, what happened to the tree?

BUFF	Hey, come on, man! Limo!
SOOZE	Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?

SOOZE	Really?
BUFF	You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.

TIM	I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
BUFF	You're fascist, man. Neofascist.

TIM	Come on man.
BUFF	Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.

TIM	Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
BUFF	Oh, Pony's band "Dream Girls"? Been on the road opening for "Midnight Hore". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?

BUFF	Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
TIM	So, how was the ride, kids?
BUFF	Great.
TIM	Really?

BUFF	They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
TIM	Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!

BUFF	Hey, man.
TIM	Hey.

ERICA	Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
BUFF	Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
ERICA	Oh, you were in the band?
BUFF	Yeah.

BUFF	Your his publicist?
ERICA	Sure I am. It's fun.
BUFF	Mm. And your like, what else?

ERICA	What do you mean? His girlfriend?
BUFF	Well, that's one way of putting it.
ERICA	Am I fucking him?
BUFF	Shit.
ERICA	Pony, what would you say our relationship is?

BUFF	So, then, you're, like, available?
ERICA	In what way?
BUFF	Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!

BUFF	Buff.
ERICA	Buff is funny. God.

BUFF	Yes! Free concert!
ERICA	Alright, Pony!

BUFF	Hey! Hey.
ERICA	I'm so burnt-out.
BUFF	Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
ERICA	Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
BUFF	Yeah?

ERICA	Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
BUFF	Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
ERICA	Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
BUFF	I can come visit?
ERICA	You better! Yes!
BUFF	I will.
ERICA	It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.

BUFF	Score! Yeah!
NAZEER	Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.

BUFF	He paid you man.
NAZEER	You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
BUFF	Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.

BUFF	Hey, we're just having a conversation.
NAZEER	This is private property, my friend.

NAZEER	Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
BUFF	We're your customers. We're not complaining.
NAZEER	Please!

BUFF	It's safe, come on.
NAZEER	That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.

BUFF	Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
NAZEER	Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!

BUFF	You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
NAZEER	Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
BUFF	No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.

NAZEER	Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
BUFF	Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!

NAZEER	Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
BUFF	Are you talking to me?
NAZEER	It's okay.
BUFF	Glad it's okay.
NAZEER	I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
BUFF	Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
NAZEER	In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
BUFF	Good. See you later.
NAZEER	You're a drunk and an idiot.
BUFF	You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
NAZEER	Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."

BUFF	Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
NAZEER	Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.

BUFF	Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
PONY	Oh, you were there?
BUFF	No, but I heard it was great.
PONY	Oh, thanks. Thanks.

BUFF	So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
PONY	Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
BUFF	Oh, So what about her?

BUFF	Yeah, we're all above that.
PONY	See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
BUFF	Well, play it, man.

PONY	No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
BUFF	Please.
PONY	I just started it.

BUFF	I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
PONY	Don't drop the guitar, man.

BUFF	Whoa!
PONY	No, no, whoa!

BUFF	Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
PONY	Hey, thanks, man.

PONY	Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
BUFF	No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.

BUFF	Thanks. See man?
PONY	You know? I remember coming here with my parents.

PONY	You make videos?
BUFF	Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
PONY	You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
BUFF	Closed, closed, closed. But with your music.
PONY	You could do it.
BUFF	I could.
PONY	Yeah!
BUFF	Yeah.
PONY	I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
BUFF	Yes!
PONY	Yeah!
BUFF	A reel?

PONY	You okay, man? You okay?
BUFF	I didn't want to eat this much, man.
PONY	Wait, I'll get you some air.

BUFF	Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
PONY	Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?

BUFF	Thanks, man!
PONY	I'll be in the car, okay?

CHIP	What's up guys?
TIM	Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?

TIM	You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
CHIP	Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
TIM	Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
CHIP	Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
TIM	Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?

CHIP	Will you stand up for me?
TIM	Okay.
CHIP	Come on. Inside.
TIM	Okay. We'll go for a ride.

TIM	So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
ERICA	It's nice here. It's different.
TIM	Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?

TIM	Hi.
ERICA	Hi.
TIM	So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
ERICA	No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
TIM	You rich?
ERICA	No, not really. Middle-class.
TIM	Oh, me too. Middle-class.
ERICA	Maybe upper-middle-class.

ERICA	Thinks he is. Well, he is.
TIM	He is?
ERICA	Yes.
TIM	He is.
ERICA	He is.
TIM	And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.

ERICA	You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
TIM	What'd he get you?
ERICA	A Porsche.
TIM	Mm.
ERICA	Yeah. So, what about you?
TIM	What about me? I don't have a car.
ERICA	You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
TIM	Military marching bands.
ERICA	You think I'm rich and you hate me.
TIM	Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
ERICA	I'd like to.
TIM	Oh, yeah?
ERICA	Mm-mm.

TIM	You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
ERICA	Really?
TIM	Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
ERICA	Mm.
TIM	It's not a job, it's an adventure. Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
ERICA	You cut off your little finger?
TIM	Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
ERICA	Let's see.

ERICA	I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
TIM	What was your name again?
ERICA	Erica.
TIM	Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
ERICA	Deep down. Way down.
TIM	It's a mistake to think that.
ERICA	We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
TIM	It's nice to do a lot of things.
ERICA	That's what I mean.
TIM	I'm not a nice guy.
ERICA	I know. It's okay.
TIM	Yeah?
ERICA	Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
TIM	No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
ERICA	Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.

ERICA	It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
TIM	Taking care of business.
ERICA	I'm sorry.

ERICA	He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
PONY	Oh, sure.
ERICA	Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
PONY	Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
ERICA	Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
PONY	Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
ERICA	Oh, wow.
PONY	I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.

ERICA	Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
PONY	We were?
ERICA	Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.

ERICA	I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
PONY	Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.

ERICA	Mm.
PONY	He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
ERICA	I'd love to read that.
PONY	Funny shit, man.

ERICA	Hi.
PONY	Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
ERICA	Hi, I'm Erica.

ERICA	Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
PONY	Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...

PONY	Um, mother-daughter.
ERICA	Pony and I are friends.

PONY	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
ERICA	It does look good.

ERICA	It's coming along.
PONY	Thank you.

PONY	Erica, you coming?
ERICA	Mm-mm.

NAZEER	Two-fifty.
GARY	Two-fifty? They go up?
NAZEER	Always two-fifty, my friend.

GARY	Can you tell me what happened?
NAZEER	He's drunk.
GARY	Uh-huh.
NAZEER	He causes problems. He was here earlier.

TIM	Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
JEFF	Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
TIM	What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
JEFF	Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
TIM	Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
JEFF	Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.

TIM	If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
JEFF	Because I'm alienated.

JEFF	You don't need to sit next to me right now.
TIM	Who were you talking to?
JEFF	Nobody. Sooze.

TIM	Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
JEFF	No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...

TIM	Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
JEFF	Sooze wants to see him.
TIM	Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.

TIM	Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
JEFF	Wow, that must be pretty nice there.

TIM	Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
JEFF	Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?

JEFF	No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
TIM	Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
JEFF	I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
TIM	Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
JEFF	Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.

TIM	I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
JEFF	No, wait, no, I thought about New York.

JEFF	Tim, what are you talking about?
TIM	Ask your girlfriend.

JEFF	See ya later.
TIM	What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?

TIM	To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
JEFF	I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
TIM	Good. That's good.

TIM	Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
JEFF	No.
TIM	Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
JEFF	What?
TIM	Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
JEFF	Yeah, fuck 'em.
TIM	No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
JEFF	Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!

JEFF	Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
TIM	No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
JEFF	What? What'd you do?
TIM	That chick, Erica?
JEFF	Well, w-what happened?
TIM	Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
JEFF	What'd you do?
TIM	I hit her.
JEFF	You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
TIM	Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
JEFF	Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
TIM	Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
JEFF	Oh fuck.

JEFF	They let you out?
TIM	Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
JEFF	You lied to me.
TIM	You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
JEFF	No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
TIM	Wow. You did that for me?
JEFF	Yes.
TIM	Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
JEFF	Why? Because I give a shit?
TIM	Oh, shit.
JEFF	Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
TIM	Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
JEFF	Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
TIM	I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
JEFF	You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
TIM	Good, good. I, I hope he does.
JEFF	The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
TIM	Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
JEFF	I don't know.
TIM	You don't know?
JEFF	No.
TIM	Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
JEFF	No.

TIM	No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
JEFF	What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
TIM	Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
JEFF	Just go home, alright?
TIM	This is my home.
JEFF	Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
TIM	They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
JEFF	They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
TIM	What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
JEFF	Will you just put the gun down?
TIM	No.
JEFF	Just put it down.

TIM	Jeff, stay there.
JEFF	He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
TIM	Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.

TIM	Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
JEFF	That, that's Indian?

JEFF	Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
TIM	Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!

TIM	Jeff! Come up here!
JEFF	Is that Bee-Bee?
TIM	Come on!

JEFF	What?
NAZEER	Seven-twenty.
JEFF	I gave it to you.

JEFF	Why we're just standing here.
NAZEER	Look, your trespassing.

NAZEER	You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
JEFF	I don't know.
NAZEER	You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
JEFF	Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
NAZEER	Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
JEFF	That's right.
NAZEER	Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?

JEFF	No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?
NAZEER	Look, why do you care, huh?
JEFF	Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
NAZEER	Okay. Nazeer, okay?
JEFF	Nazeer what?
NAZEER	Nazeer Chaudry!

JEFF	Please?
NAZEER	Look, look, just get off my property.

NAZEER	This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
JEFF	I don't know. I think she's breathing.
NAZEER	Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.

JEFF	God, I haven't seen you all day.
SOOZE	You could've come over.
JEFF	I know, I know, I know.

JEFF	Oh! Trim it!
SOOZE	I hate that.
JEFF	Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
SOOZE	No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
JEFF	Okay, so maybe later.

JEFF	Was that supposed to be me?
SOOZE	No.
JEFF	Yes.

JEFF	No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
SOOZE	Man?
JEFF	Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
SOOZE	It's a piece.
JEFF	Your sure as hell right about that.
SOOZE	I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.

JEFF	The worst I can do is starve to death. Listen to you.
SOOZE	I don't want to hear it anymore.
JEFF	No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
SOOZE	Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
JEFF	Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
SOOZE	Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.

JEFF	What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
SOOZE	So you can give me more shit?
JEFF	No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
SOOZE	I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.

SOOZE	Yes, you asshole.
JEFF	About what?
SOOZE	About things that are important to me.
JEFF	Like what?
SOOZE	Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...

SOOZE	Of course I do!
JEFF	Name one.
SOOZE	God, KAREN JOHNSON.
JEFF	One!
SOOZE	Your completely missing the point.
JEFF	Hey!
SOOZE	I'm talking about idealism.

JEFF	No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
SOOZE	No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
JEFF	No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
SOOZE	But do you stand for anything?
JEFF	Yes, I stand for -
SOOZE	What? What do you stand for?
JEFF	I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
SOOZE	Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
JEFF	Can I talk here? Let me talk.
SOOZE	You know, all you know is what's good for you.
JEFF	Can I talk?
SOOZE	Typical male.

SOOZE	I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
JEFF	Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
SOOZE	Um, because you didn't want to go.
JEFF	Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
SOOZE	Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.

SOOZE	This is ridiculous!
JEFF	Tim!

SOOZE	It was a racial incident.
JEFF	It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
SOOZE	It got that close.
JEFF	Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
SOOZE	Oh, yeah?
JEFF	Yeah.
SOOZE	Okay, what would you have done.
JEFF	I would've stopped it.
SOOZE	How?
JEFF	I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
SOOZE	Jeff. Jeff.
JEFF	... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
SOOZE	Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
JEFF	Sooze.

SOOZE	What?
JEFF	Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
SOOZE	What feelings?
JEFF	Us.
SOOZE	Of course.
JEFF	And?
SOOZE	Come with me.
JEFF	No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
SOOZE	So what do you wanna do?
JEFF	Nothing.
SOOZE	No one does nothing, Jeff.
JEFF	Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
SOOZE	New ground?
JEFF	Mm-hm.
SOOZE	Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
JEFF	Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
SOOZE	My goal is to make art.
JEFF	So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
SOOZE	Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
JEFF	Mm-mm.
SOOZE	So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
JEFF	No, no.
SOOZE	So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
JEFF	I don't know.

JEFF	Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
SOOZE	Mm.

JEFF	Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
SOOZE	Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
JEFF	No, I don't.
SOOZE	Yes, you do.
JEFF	No, I don't.
SOOZE	You do.
JEFF	No, I don't.

JEFF	FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
SOOZE	Jeff!
JEFF	So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?

SOOZE	Come on.
JEFF	No. No, no, no.
SOOZE	Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
JEFF	No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
SOOZE	Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.

JEFF	Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
SOOZE	Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.

SOOZE	Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
JEFF	No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
SOOZE	Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
JEFF	But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
SOOZE	What?
JEFF	No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
SOOZE	Mm-hm.
JEFF	And I fig- and I figured something out.
SOOZE	Oh, yeah?
JEFF	I, yeah.
SOOZE	Mm.

JEFF	Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
SOOZE	God, you smell like whiskey.
JEFF	No, no, I have to talk to you.
SOOZE	Is that a threat?

JEFF	Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
SOOZE	I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
JEFF	Where are you going?
SOOZE	For a ride.
JEFF	Wait, away?
SOOZE	Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
JEFF	To his hotel?
SOOZE	Shit, Jeff!

SOOZE	I've run out of words.
JEFF	Wait. What, what are you saying?
SOOZE	I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
JEFF	Well, what about us?
SOOZE	What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
JEFF	No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
SOOZE	Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
JEFF	Oh, no, no, no.
SOOZE	You're unbelievable.
JEFF	Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
SOOZE	You did, huh? Good for you.
JEFF	Oh, fuck it, man!

JEFF	Do your covers and all that shit.
SOOZE	'Bye, Jeff.
JEFF	Go.
SOOZE	What?
JEFF	Just go.

SOOZE	You really suck, you know that?
JEFF	Just go.

JEFF	Hey, Pony.
PONY	Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
JEFF	Good, man.
PONY	Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
JEFF	Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
PONY	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
JEFF	No, it's not...
PONY	Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
JEFF	Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
PONY	Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
JEFF	Yeah.
PONY	We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
JEFF	Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
PONY	Nah, nah, nah, nah.
JEFF	Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
PONY	Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
JEFF	Yeah.
PONY	The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
JEFF	Yeah, I crash there.
PONY	Yeah, good.

JEFF	The prom. That's funny.
PONY	Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
JEFF	Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
PONY	Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.

JEFF	Sorry.
PONY	So how's college?
JEFF	I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.

JEFF	You know, I've thought about that, actually.
PONY	No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.

JEFF	So you think I should?
PONY	What?
JEFF	Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
PONY	Like songs?
JEFF	Yeah, they could be songs.
PONY	Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
JEFF	Really?
PONY	Yeah, really.
JEFF	Now?
PONY	Yeah.

JEFF	Great.
PONY	Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!

JEFF	Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
PONY	Well, not exactly.
JEFF	For a while.
PONY	Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.

JEFF	So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
PONY	No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.

JEFF	So who are you?
PONY	What do you mean?
JEFF	Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
PONY	I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
JEFF	Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
PONY	What?
JEFF	Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
PONY	Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
JEFF	Of course it does.

JEFF	W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
PONY	You know what I'm saying?

JEFF	No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
PONY	Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
JEFF	No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
PONY	Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?

PONY	George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
JEFF	No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
PONY	Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.

JEFF	I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
PONY	Oh, yeah.
JEFF	I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
PONY	Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.

JEFF	Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
PONY	Burnfield. No place like it.

PONY	Hey, where's Erica?
JEFF	I don't know.

JEFF	I don't know.
PONY	I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.

NAZEER	Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
TIM	Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
NAZEER	No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
TIM	Well, what about this?

NAZEER	What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
TIM	Camel jockey.
NAZEER	You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
TIM	Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.

NAZEER	Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
TIM	Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
NAZEER	Please. Look...

NAZEER	Look, get down off my property.
TIM	Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
NAZEER	Get off my property!
TIM	Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
NAZEER	Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
TIM	Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.

NAZEER	Look Pakeesa...
TIM	Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
NAZEER	Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
TIM	You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!

NAZEER	Get off my roof!
TIM	Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
NAZEER	Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.

TIM	Ready?
NAZEER	What are you saying?

TIM	I hope you're happy!
NAZEER	This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
TIM	No, this has everything to do with you.
NAZEER	No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
TIM	Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!

SOOZE	Pony, oh my god!
PONY	Hey!
SOOZE	You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
PONY	Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
SOOZE	Is that your driver?
PONY	It's stupid.
SOOZE	No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
PONY	Look at you!
SOOZE	Oh!
PONY	Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
SOOZE	Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
PONY	Oh, yeah?
SOOZE	So? What's L.A. like?
PONY	It's pretty exciting.
SOOZE	Yeah?
PONY	Yeah.
SOOZE	Like?
PONY	Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
SOOZE	No, she was just sitting there?!
PONY	Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
SOOZE	You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
PONY	New York, huh?
SOOZE	Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
PONY	You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.
SOOZE	You do not!
PONY	I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.

SOOZE	Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
PONY	Hey.

SOOZE	Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
PONY	Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
SOOZE	Yeah?
PONY	Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
SOOZE	You do not want me to do your cover.
PONY	I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
SOOZE	You're not serious.
PONY	I'm always serious.
SOOZE	Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
PONY	I get final approval. It's in my contract.
SOOZE	Would I get paid?
PONY	Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
SOOZE	Yeah?
PONY	Yeah.
SOOZE	Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.

PONY	Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
SOOZE	Yeah.
PONY	And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.

SOOZE	Yeah, come on, play it.
PONY	Oh, no, man. I can't.

PONY	Alright, alright already.
SOOZE	Alright!

PONY	Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
SOOZE	That was so great!

SOOZE	You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
PONY	Mine too.

PONY	Oh, How'd she get back?
TIM	I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?

PONY	Yeah? Well, what'd she say?

PONY	Whatever.
TIM	Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?

SCUFF	Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
TIM	It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
SCUFF	So where are you?
TIM	I'm here.

TIM	Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
SOOZE	At least I have a point of view, you know?

TIM	Seriously? It's a great idea.
SOOZE	Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
TIM	I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.

TIM	Why don't you go back to where you came from?
SOOZE	Hey, Tim.
TIM	No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.

TIM	Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
SOOZE	Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
TIM	Fucking drunk, huh?
SOOZE	You have the largest penis. Can we go please?

TIM	Hey, your gonna regret this.
SOOZE	Come on, Jeff.

SOOZE	Leave him alone, Tim.
TIM	Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
SOOZE	Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
TIM	Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
SOOZE	Jeff!

SOOZE	Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
TIM	Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.

TIM	Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
SOOZE	Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.

SOOZE	It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
TIM	Oh that's nice for you.

SOOZE	Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
TIM	There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".

SOOZE	Could you give me a ride?
TIM	Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
SOOZE	Tim, go throw up somewhere.

SOOZE	I'm going out later.
SOOZE'S MOM	No car.
SOOZE	The fuck not?
SOOZE'S MOM	You know the fuck not.
SOOZE	Fuck.
SOOZE'S MOM	Don't swear it's impolite.

CHIEF	Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
HAMMER	I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
CHIEF	A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
HAMMER	Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.

HAMMER	I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
CHIEF	What's your first move?
HAMMER	I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.

HAMMER	Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
CHIEF	You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
HAMMER	That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.

HAMMER	It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
CHIEF	Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
HAMMER	Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
CHIEF	One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...

CHIEF	Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
HAMMER	What's up?
CHIEF	About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.

HAMMER	Looks like I got a plane to catch.
CHIEF	Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
HAMMER	No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.

CHIEF	So why the long face?
HAMMER	It's Esther. Santa's got her.
CHIEF	My Esther! Oh Mordechai.

CHIEF	Please. Will you help me?
HAMMER	I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.

HAMMER	There won't be any need for that sir.
CHIEF	Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
HAMMER	I know sir. I won't let you down.

MRS. CARVER	So. Do you have a name?
ESTHER	It's Esther.
MRS. CARVER	From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.

MRS. CARVER	You like my Mordechai, yes?
ESTHER	He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.

MRS. CARVER	Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
ESTHER	What do you want me to do?
MRS. CARVER	He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.

ESTHER	Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
MRS. CARVER	Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.

ESTHER	Mr. Jefferson Carver?
HAMMER	Please, call me Mordechai.
HAMMER	From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
ESTHER	Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?

HAMMER	Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?
ESTHER	My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
HAMMER	How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
ESTHER	Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.

HAMMER	Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
ESTHER	Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
HAMMER	I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...

HAMMER	Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
ESTHER	I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.

ESTHER	Any sign of Santa?
HAMMER	He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.

ESTHER	What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
HAMMER	C'mon follow me.

HAMMER	That got annoying fairly quickly.
ESTHER	Yeah, no kidding.

ESTHER	So, now what?
HAMMER	Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.

HAMMER	Want to get a drink?
ESTHER	Sure. Why not.

HAMMER	What was that!?
ESTHER	I said, do you come here often!?

ESTHER	What!?
HAMMER	I said, yeah, about once a week!
ESTHER	Oh!

HAMMER	Sorry. I'm better with men.
ESTHER	Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
HAMMER	You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.

ESTHER	Mordechai?
HAMMER	Yes Esther.
ESTHER	I want you to talk dirty to me.
HAMMER	Oh. Okay.

HAMMER	I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
ESTHER	Keep going.
HAMMER	Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.

HAMMER	Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
ESTHER	Kiss me you Semitic stud!

ESTHER	Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
HAMMER	Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?

HAMMER	When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
ESTHER	Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...

HAMMER	Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
ESTHER	No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...

ESTHER	We do!
HAMMER	I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.

HAMMER	What are you doing here?
ESTHER	Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
HAMMER	I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
ESTHER	I forgive you.

HAMMER	Esther!
ESTHER	Mordechai!

HAMMER	Esther!
ESTHER	Mordechai!

ESTHER	You two know each other?
HAMMER	We go to the same temple.

HAMMER	Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
MRS. CARVER	I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.

MRS. CARVER	Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
HAMMER	Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.

HAMMER	Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
MRS. CARVER	When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
HAMMER	So don't show a picture.
MRS. CARVER	You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.

MRS. CARVER	I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
HAMMER	No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
MRS. CARVER	Do what you must.

MRS. CARVER	Let's let your tuchus breathe.
HAMMER	Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?

HAMMER	...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
MRS. CARVER	Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.

HAMMER	...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
MRS. CARVER	...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.

HAMMER	Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
MRS. CARVER	Mazel Tov!

MRS. CARVER	Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
HAMMER	...I'm not finished yet, mom.

HAMMER	Mom! We're eating!
MRS. CARVER	What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!

HAMMER	Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
TIKVA	Happy Hanukkah Morty.

HAMMER	Okay, what's the information?
TIKVA	She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.

HAMMER	Anything else?
TIKVA	Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.

HAMMER	But we're not open on Sundays.
TIKVA	I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
HAMMER	I'll be in my office.

MOHAMMED	So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
HAMMER	I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
MOHAMMED	Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.

HAMMER	Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
MOHAMMED	Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
HAMMER	Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?

MOHAMMED	You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
HAMMER	Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
MOHAMMED	It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.

MOHAMMED	What's wrong with him?
HAMMER	He's still working out some identity issues.

HAMMER	It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
MOHAMMED	I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.

MOHAMMED	Cool. What's it do?
HAMMER	Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.

MOHAMMED	Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
HAMMER	But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.

MOHAMMED	Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
HAMMER	Oh yeah. Take a look.

MOHAMMED	What are you doing?
HAMMER	Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.

HAMMER	Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
MOHAMMED	A stereo type alarm system?
HAMMER	Take a look.

MOHAMMED	How do we bypass it?
HAMMER	The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.

MOHAMMED	Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.
HAMMER	Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.

MOHAMMED	What are you doing?
HAMMER	Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.

MOHAMMED	Hammer, you alright?
HAMMER	Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.

SANTA	Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
HAMMER	If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
SANTA	Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?

HAMMER	Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
SANTA	The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.

HAMMER	What's your shpiel, Santa?
SANTA	Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.

HAMMER	What are you doing?
SANTA	I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.

HAMMER	Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
SANTA	In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.

HAMMER	Where's my girlfriend Santa?
SANTA	I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!

HAMMER	I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
SANTA	Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.

TINY TIM	So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
SANTA	While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.

TINY TIM	What should I charge?
SANTA	Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.

TINY TIM	So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
SANTA	Worse.

SANTA	Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
TINY TIM	That's some cold shit.

SANTA	So, how was I?
TINY TIM	It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.

SANTA	I wasn't too over the top?
TINY TIM	No, it was the perfect level.
SANTA	Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good.

TINY TIM	You okay?
SANTA	No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
TINY TIM	I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.

SANTA	Get off of me you cripple!
TINY TIM	What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.

SANTA	What's going on? Why'd he stop?
TINY TIM	Maybe he ran out of ammo.
SANTA	Take a look.

TINY TIM	Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
SANTA	Resting?

SANTA	What day is it?
TINY TIM	It's Friday.

TINY TIM	You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
SANTA	No dipshit, I want you to kill him.

EPPS	You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
DRIVER	Y-yes.

EPPS	Where were you going?
DRIVER	Baghdad.
EPPS	What's in the other direction?
DRIVER	This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
EPPS	Turn the car around.
DRIVER	Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
EPPS	Nobody's going to hurt you.

WES	Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
EPPS	Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.

WES	...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.
EPPS	You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.

EPPS	Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
WES	I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.

WES	Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
EPPS	Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.

WES	Paper.
EPPS	It's a fortune box.

WES	What's it say?
EPPS	Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.

WES	It's a map, I think that's what it is.
EPPS	There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.

EPPS	A casual one.
WES	Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
EPPS	Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.

WES	You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
EPPS	I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.

EPPS	Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
WES	Oh, God.

WES	What?
EPPS	I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
WES	I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.

EPPS	Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
WES	No, please, not again.

WES	What are we going to do!?
EPPS	We're going to keep driving.

WES	They stopped.
EPPS	Wha...
WES	Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.

EPPS	They shouldn't have been here.
WES	We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
EPPS	This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
WES	Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
EPPS	They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.

WES	What are you doing.
EPPS	Low on gas.  Got to refill.

EPPS	You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
WES	Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.

EPPS	Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
WES	Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
EPPS	He's not so--
WES	He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
EPPS	How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.

WES	What kind of mine?
EPPS	I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
WES	Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
EPPS	Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.

EPPS	We've got rope?
WES	For climbing.
EPPS	Break it out.

WES	What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
EPPS	You just go when I say go.
WES	Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.

EPPS	Ready?
WES	Yeah.

EPPS	All right.  Let's get out of here.
WES	The soldiers are going to kill those people!

EPPS	There's nothing we can do.
WES	We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.

EPPS	I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
WES	We can't just go off and--
EPPS	There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.

EPPS	All we've got to do is make it to the top.
WES	And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
EPPS	We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.

EPPS	Not much of a pass.
WES	Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
EPPS	Picks up again just on the other side.

WES	The US Army:  Always an adventure.
EPPS	Let me see the map.

EPPS	Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
WES	What do you figure it to be?
EPPS	Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.

WES	Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
EPPS	Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--

WES	Where'd they go?
EPPS	I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
WES	Weird they didn't chase us.

WES	And they can't fly around out there forever.
EPPS	So we wait.

WES	Missile!
EPPS	Move!

EPPS	All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.
WES	What am I supposed to do?
EPPS	Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.

WES	Epps!
EPPS	I heard!

EPPS	I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
WES	Ready when you are.

WES	You ready?
EPPS	All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--

EPPS	It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
WES	What about the gold?
EPPS	What about it?
WES	Maybe we should split it up now.
EPPS	We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
WES	What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.

WES	You're the one with all the ideas.
EPPS	You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
WES	Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
EPPS	Maybe I do.
WES	Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.

WES	You got no reason to do that!
EPPS	I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?

WES	You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
EPPS	Then get up and do something about it.

EPPS	Get off him.
WES	He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
EPPS	Get off him!

EPPS	What happened?
WES	I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.

EPPS	Stop it!
WES	I told you; don't push me around.

WES	Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
EPPS	Why'd he come in our camp.

WES	Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
EPPS	How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
WES	He...he could have been watching us.

WES	I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
EPPS	Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.

WES	We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
EPPS	You said he was a deserter.
WES	That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
EPPS	You don't know that.
WES	You don't know he isn't.

EPPS	You're out of your mind.
WES	He's an enemy soldier.
EPPS	I'm not going to let you kill him.
WES	We're at war.

EPPS	We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
WES	He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.

WES	I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
EPPS	I've got no stomach for murder.
WES	It's a combat action.
EPPS	It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
WES	Then step aside.
EPPS	No.
WES	Get out of my way.

WES	You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
EPPS	I out rank you, that's why.
WES	In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.

EPPS	We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
WES	What if I do?

WES	No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
EPPS	Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
WES	Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
EPPS	And let me guess who is.

WES	I'm the one's got the big stick.
EPPS	Suppose I don't go for that?
WES	Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
EPPS	What about Jaeger?
WES	Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.

WES	In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
EPPS	We thought--

EPPS	Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
WES	Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
EPPS	Wes--
WES	Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?

WES	Thanks for taking care of this for me.
EPPS	Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.

WES	You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
EPPS	That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
WES	That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--

WES	They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
EPPS	You don't know John Epps very well, do you?

EPPS	Just keep quiet.
WES	I have to answer him.
EPPS	So you can give us away?
WES	If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.

WES	Give it to me!
EPPS	If I give it to you, will you let us go?

WES	Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
EPPS	It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?

JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
EPPS	What are you doing?
JAEGER	What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--

JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
EPPS	Knock it off!
JAEGER	Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
EPPS	Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
JAEGER	I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
EPPS	No you're not.

EPPS	You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
JAEGER	Blow me.
EPPS	Another month in this desert and I might just.

EPPS	Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
JAEGER	Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.

EPPS	Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
JAEGER	There might be something in there.
EPPS	Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
JAEGER	There might be.

JAEGER	This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
EPPS	Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
JAEGER	I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.

EPPS	You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.
JAEGER	OH MY GOD!

EPPS	What!?  What!?
JAEGER	I did it!  I got the box open.

JAEGER	You think?
EPPS	Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.

JAEGER	They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
EPPS	Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
JAEGER	I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.

EPPS	Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
JAEGER	Wait.  Wait.

EPPS	I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
JAEGER	Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
EPPS	Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
JAEGER	Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.

EPPS	And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
JAEGER	What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.

EPPS	It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
JAEGER	We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
EPPS	But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.

EPPS	It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
JAEGER	We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.

EPPS	Now this is war.
JAEGER	Roger that.

JAEGER	You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
EPPS	Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?

EPPS	But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
JAEGER	You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?

EPPS	Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
JAEGER	Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
EPPS	A car?  You're going to buy a car?

EPPS	You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
JAEGER	What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
EPPS	Invest it.
JAEGER	Oh, that's fun.
EPPS	It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
JAEGER	And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
EPPS	You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--

EPPS	Take the binoculars.
JAEGER	Wh-what do you think--
EPPS	TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!

EPPS	Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
JAEGER	We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
EPPS	We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.

JAEGER	They'll shoot us!
EPPS	We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
JAEGER	They're not going to--
EPPS	It's the only way.  We drive!

EPPS	Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
JAEGER	Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.

JAEGER	Steady it out!
EPPS	I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!

EPPS	She okay?
JAEGER	Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
EPPS	Let's go.

EPPS	What?
JAEGER	I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
EPPS	You can't tell anybody about this.
JAEGER	I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!

EPPS	It'd make their heads explode.
JAEGER	Millionaires, man.

EPPS	Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
JAEGER	...I know.
EPPS	And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
JAEGER	I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.

EPPS	What do we do with the Humvee?
JAEGER	We leave it.

EPPS	SAY IT!
JAEGER	I got that...sir.

JAEGER	Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
EPPS	Faster we get there, faster we get back.
JAEGER	Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.

JAEGER	I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
EPPS	Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
JAEGER	I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.

EPPS	What!?
JAEGER	Mine.

EPPS	What?
JAEGER	Mine.  Land mine!

EPPS	You didn't step on any mine.
JAEGER	I heard it click.
EPPS	If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
JAEGER	I heard it.

JAEGER	Oh, God!  Oh God!
EPPS	Just be cool.
JAEGER	It's a mine, isn't it?
EPPS	Just relax.
JAEGER	How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
EPPS	We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.

JAEGER	Where you going?
EPPS	Me and Wes are just going to talk.
JAEGER	Why you got to move away to talk!?
EPPS	We're going to be right over here.
JAEGER	You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
EPPS	I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!

EPPS	There's a way.
JAEGER	Epps...

EPPS	I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
JAEGER	Epps, my leg is falling asleep.

JAEGER	My leg is falling asleep.
EPPS	It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
JAEGER	I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
EPPS	It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.

JAEGER	How's this going to work?
EPPS	Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
JAEGER	That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.

EPPS	You're going to be fine.
JAEGER	You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!

EPPS	When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
JAEGER	Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.

JAEGER	You're going to blow yourselves up.
EPPS	Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
JAEGER	You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
EPPS	If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.

EPPS	This.  Whatever it is.
JAEGER	It's the treasure, that's what it is.

EPPS	You're not losing trust, are you?
JAEGER	Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.

EPPS	I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
JAEGER	Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.

JAEGER	I don't hear any--
EPPS	Shut up and listen!

EPPS	Don't!
JAEGER	It's a fire fight.
EPPS	Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.

EPPS	Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
JAEGER	What are they doing here?

EPPS	Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
JAEGER	What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?

EPPS	They're doing more than slapping.
JAEGER	The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.

EPPS	Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
JAEGER	So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.

JAEGER	X marks the spot.
EPPS	Something like that.
JAEGER	But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
EPPS	I hope it means something, otherwise...

JAEGER	Where is it?  Where'd it go?
EPPS	Stay low.
JAEGER	Where the hell is it!?
EPPS	Just stay down.

JAEGER	What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
EPPS	We're not going to do anything.
JAEGER	They're going to kill us!
EPPS	They can't shoot us in here.

JAEGER	If they land--
EPPS	If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.

JAEGER	Think there might be more Iraqis?
EPPS	Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.

EPPS	A whole lot of nothing.
JAEGER	So where do we start?

EPPS	What are you doing?
JAEGER	What does it look like I'm doing?
EPPS	It looks like you're not doing anything.
JAEGER	I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
EPPS	Get up and dig.
JAEGER	We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
EPPS	Get up off your ass and dig!

JAEGER	Must be a compartment.
EPPS	I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.

JAEGER	Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
EPPS	It's giving.

EPPS	It's just a mongoose.
JAEGER	Is it dead?
EPPS	Yeah, Bwana, you got it.

JAEGER	It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
EPPS	I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
JAEGER	You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.

JAEGER	Wait.
EPPS	What?

EPPS	What?
JAEGER	We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
EPPS	He's not going to leave us.
JAEGER	What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...

JAEGER	Why do I have to stay down here?
EPPS	Jesus, Jaeger.
JAEGER	I don't see how that plan's any better.
EPPS	Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.

EPPS	All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
JAEGER	Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.

EPPS	What the hell took so long.
JAEGER	Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
EPPS	Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.

JAEGER	Wes might be right about that.
EPPS	It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.

EPPS	We should head Northeast.
JAEGER	Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
EPPS	There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
JAEGER	It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
EPPS	You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.

JAEGER	What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
EPPS	We'll find our way.
JAEGER	How!?
EPPS	We'll find our way!  We'll...

EPPS	We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
JAEGER	Forget Wes.
EPPS	We can't just leave him.
JAEGER	Wes is dead!
EPPS	What if he's not?
JAEGER	Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.

JAEGER	No.
EPPS	We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.

JAEGER	No.
EPPS	What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
JAEGER	They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
EPPS	We'll lie.
JAEGER	They'll search the pack.

EPPS	First Wes, now you?
JAEGER	I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
EPPS	And you; you've got it all together.
JAEGER	I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
EPPS	That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.

JAEGER	I'm sorry about that, Epps.
EPPS	Is it all right if I stand up?

JAEGER	I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
EPPS	Yeah.  Well, me too.
JAEGER	I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
EPPS	Sure.
JAEGER	Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
EPPS	You still got a map on you?
JAEGER	What?  Yeah.

JAEGER	Epps?
EPPS	Yeah.
JAEGER	I don't want to die.
EPPS	Makes two of us.
JAEGER	I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.
EPPS	It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
JAEGER	I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--

JAEGER	Sorry.
EPPS	Damn.

JAEGER	What do you think our chances are?
EPPS	If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.

JAEGER	Wonder how the war's going?
EPPS	It's got to be going better than this..

EPPS	We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.
JAEGER	You sure you want me too?

JAEGER	I pick that way.
EPPS	Okay.  Then we go this way.

JAEGER	Getting cold.
EPPS	It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
JAEGER	Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
EPPS	No!
JAEGER	Just let me rest for a second.
EPPS	We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
JAEGER	You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
EPPS	Don't you touch it.
JAEGER	I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
EPPS	The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
JAEGER	Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.

JAEGER	What do you figure it is?
EPPS	Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
JAEGER	Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
EPPS	Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.

EPPS	We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
JAEGER	Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.

JAEGER	Well?
EPPS	Well, we should identify ourselves.
JAEGER	Yeah, I guess we should.

EPPS	Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
JAEGER	Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.

EPPS	That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
JAEGER	Probably.

EPPS	What did you say?
JAEGER	I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
EPPS	They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!

JAEGER	Oh, God...
EPPS	They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
JAEGER	What are we going to do?

EPPS	Slip out your M-16.
JAEGER	And then what?
EPPS	And then shoot them.
JAEGER	I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
EPPS	Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.

JAEGER	Can't you--
EPPS	I don't have a weapon.

EPPS	Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
JAEGER	I just said I would.  I don't think I--
EPPS	Shoot them!

EPPS	An Iraqi?
JAEGER	I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.

JAEGER	What do we do?
EPPS	We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.

JAEGER	To where?
EPPS	Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.

JAEGER	What do we do?
EPPS	We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.

JAEGER	What do you make of them?
EPPS	Shi'ites, I think.
JAEGER	Is that good, or bad?
EPPS	I don't know.  They killed Wes.
JAEGER	Why haven't they killed us!?
EPPS	I don't know!
JAEGER	...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
EPPS	With what?  Against how many?
JAEGER	We can't just sit here waiting to die.
EPPS	You come up with a better plan, let me know.
JAEGER	Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.

EPPS	...Wes...?
JAEGER	You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!

JAEGER	I didn't say that.  I never said--
EPPS	Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.

JAEGER	Can you ride a horse?
EPPS	No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.

JAEGER	Which way do we go!?
EPPS	We go this way.

EPPS	Damn it.  We lost the horses.
JAEGER	The...the gold...
EPPS	It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
JAEGER	When did you make the switch?
EPPS	It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
JAEGER	But...
EPPS	We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
JAEGER	What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
EPPS	You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.

JAEGER	Well?
EPPS	A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
JAEGER	How do we do that?
EPPS	You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
JAEGER	Why do I have to lie in the road?
EPPS	Somebody has to.
JAEGER	Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
EPPS	Then I'm a rich man.

JAEGER	Epps.
EPPS	Yeah.
JAEGER	I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
EPPS	Thanks.
JAEGER	This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
EPPS	Threatened to blow my brains out?
JAEGER	Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
EPPS	Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.

JAEGER	Epps?
EPPS	What?
JAEGER	I'm thinking about taking a trip.
EPPS	Thought you were going to buy a car.
JAEGER	Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
EPPS	I don't know.
JAEGER	I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
EPPS	How the hell should I know?

EPPS	Australia.
JAEGER	What?
EPPS	I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
JAEGER	Really?
EPPS	That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.

JAEGER	Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
EPPS	We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.

JAEGER	Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
EPPS	He'll slow down.

JAEGER	He's not slowing.
EPPS	He's going to slow down.

JAEGER	Woods.
WOODS	Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
JAEGER	I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
WOODS	A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?

WOODS	That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
JAEGER	I could use some recon photos too.

WOODS	Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
JAEGER	Just...want to be ready when we do.
WOODS	Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
JAEGER	The photos.

JAEGER	Some good ones.
WOODS	They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
JAEGER	Saddam's got a boil on his ass?

WES	Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
JAEGER	A headache?
WES	Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
JAEGER	I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
WES	Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
JAEGER	Okay.

JAEGER	We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
WES	I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
JAEGER	People are suffering.
WES	People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.

JAEGER	When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
WES	I'm saying don't do it accidently.
JAEGER	Oh yeah.  Accidently.

WES	Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
JAEGER	It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
WES	I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.

JAEGER	Spanish wasn't hard enough?
WES	I thought it would be good to know.

JAEGER	What does that mean?
WES	Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
JAEGER	How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
WES	Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.

JAEGER	What is this?
WES	Now you need me.
JAEGER	What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.

WES	He says it's a box.
JAEGER	Yeah, you're funny.
WES	It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
JAEGER	For real?  A treasure?

WES	And you're the guy who's going to open it.
JAEGER	I could.

WES	You get it yet?
JAEGER	Naw, nothing.
WES	You will.  You'll get it.
JAEGER	I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
WES	You really think there's a treasure inside?
JAEGER	I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.

WES	Jaeger?
JAEGER	What?
WES	You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
JAEGER	Yeah.  So?
WES	That's in two days.
JAEGER	Like I said; so?
WES	They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
JAEGER	What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
WES	We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
JAEGER	It doesn't mean anything.
WES	Why would they do all that if we weren't?

WES	Jaeger?
JAEGER	What!?
WES	You ever think about dying?
JAEGER	Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
WES	You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
JAEGER	The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.

JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.
WES	This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
JAEGER	At-at-at-at-at.

WES	The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
JAEGER	You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.

JAEGER	It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
WES	It's a container.  Break the seal.

JAEGER	That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
WES	Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?

JAEGER	We...we could go home with something else.
WES	What?
JAEGER	With...with millions.  Millions of dollars.

WES	You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
JAEGER	It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
WES	You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
JAEGER	It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
WES	It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
JAEGER	It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
WES	So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.

WES	Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
JAEGER	You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
WES	You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.

WES	God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
JAEGER	Yes!

WES	We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
JAEGER	Hell, we'll just buy our way out.

JAEGER	Epps, is that a sand dune.
WES	Oh, no.

JAEGER	Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
WES	If!  If there's a treasure.
JAEGER	Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
WES	I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
JAEGER	Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
WES	How the hell should I know how much?

WES	If there's gold.  If!
JAEGER	You know what I'm doing with my half?

WES	This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
JAEGER	A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--

JAEGER	Iraqis.
WES	Oh, God!
JAEGER	Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
WES	Oh, Jesus!
JAEGER	They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!

JAEGER	Yeah!  Yeah!
WES	I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
JAEGER	You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.

WES	I thought we were dead.
JAEGER	Yeah, well, we're not.
WES	We got to get out of here.

WES	We have to go back.
JAEGER	We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
WES	We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?

WES	So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
JAEGER	...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.

JAEGER	We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
WES	Then lets go back while we still can.
JAEGER	As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it.

WES	You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
JAEGER	You have to go with us, Wes.
WES	Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
JAEGER	You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...

JAEGER	Epps...
WES	Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.

WES	How long we going to keep this up.
JAEGER	Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
WES	Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
JAEGER	That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
WES	You want to crawl, crawl.

WES	If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
JAEGER	Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.

WES	I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
JAEGER	Anytime you want to do something about it just let--

JAEGER	Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
WES	Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.

WES	Is there anything you do know?
JAEGER	I know you're a pussy.  I know that.

JAEGER	So?
WES	We have to do something.

WES	We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
JAEGER	Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
WES	You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
JAEGER	I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.

JAEGER	Think we can make it?
WES	We make it, or we go back empty handed.

JAEGER	Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
WES	Just seems weird they didn't chase us.

WES	What do you think?
JAEGER	Lines up with the map and the photos.

WES	It's got a bottom.
JAEGER	Guess we know what the next stop is.

WES	You down?
JAEGER	Yeah, we're down.
WES	What do you see?

WES	What the hell are you doing!?
JAEGER	I think we found something.

JAEGER	With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
WES	He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.

WES	Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
JAEGER	He lived through that?

JAEGER	Maybe we should give him some water.
WES	All last night he could have been--
JAEGER	I think he wants something to drink.
WES	I'm not wasting my water on him.

JAEGER	So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
WES	He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.

JAEGER	Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.
WES	You want to say some words?

JAEGER	You're going to burn up in those.
WES	The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.

JAEGER	Think the Iraqi's killed them all?
WES	Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.

WES	When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
JAEGER	We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
WES	You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.

LOTHER	Anya!
ANYA	Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.

LOTHER	Anya, I think you're crazy.
ANYA	Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
LOTHER	I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.

ANYA	Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
LOTHER	Do you want the truth, Anya?
ANYA	It would be a nice change from you.
LOTHER	I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
ANYA	You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
LOTHER	How'd you ever get away with it?
ANYA	When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
LOTHER	Sure!
ANYA	I never want to go back....

ANYA	Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
LOTHER	Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
ANYA	That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.

LOTHER	But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
ANYA	I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?

ANYA	Hope we're not intruding.
LOTHER	This is Miss Marsh.
ANYA	Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?

ANYA	Well--shall we go into dinner?
LOTHER	I'll join you later.
ANYA	And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.

ANYA	So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
LOTHER	I can explain--
ANYA	Sure! You're never at a loss for words.

ANYA	Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
LOTHER	Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
ANYA	Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
LOTHER	You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
ANYA	Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
LOTHER	I didn't ask you to come away with me--
ANYA	Oh--a hundred times--
LOTHER	--and I can tell you where to get off.
ANYA	And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
LOTHER	Will you leave me alone?
ANYA	I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
LOTHER	Baloney!
ANYA	No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.

BRETT	I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
ANYA	I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.

ANYA	Feeling a little better, I see.
BRETT	Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.

BRETT	Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
ANYA	Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.

ANYA	Good afternoon--
BRETT	Glad to see you again.

BRETT	I hope so.
ANYA	That's a date. 

BRETT	Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
ANYA	We'll save you a place at our table.
BRETT	Thanks.

BRETT	Isn't she lovely?
ANYA	Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 

ANYA	No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
BRETT	Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?

SALLY	How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
ANYA	Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.

SALLY	You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
ANYA	Sorry I can't return the compliment.
SALLY	You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
ANYA	I don't understand.
SALLY	I think you do.

SUMMERS	A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
ANYA	Montana?
SUMMERS	Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.

SUMMERS	--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
ANYA	Isn't that interesting?

ANYA	You'll excuse me. 
SUMMERS	Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.

SUMMERS	Will you pardon me?
ANYA	<U>Gladly</U>.

SUMMERS	You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
ANYA	I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.

SUMMERS	Did you find it?
ANYA	No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
SUMMERS	No-o!
ANYA	Where's Lother?

MCKINNEY	Where'd you get it?
BALLINGER	Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
MCKINNEY	What did you want a gun for?
BALLINGER	Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
MCKINNEY	Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
BALLINGER	Guess again, copper.
MCKINNEY	Get moving--

BRETT	Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
LOTHER	We'll be expecting you.

LOTHER	We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
BRETT	Not at all.

BRETT	Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
LOTHER	If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 

LOTHER	I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
BRETT	I'll bet a couple of hundred.

BRETT	Aces full.
LOTHER	And me coming in with two pair-- 

LOTHER	You're coming back--
BRETT	That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?

LOTHER	How about a little game later?
BRETT	Fine--I'll be glad to.

LOTHER	Could I see you a minute?
BRETT	Sure!  Excuse me.

LOTHER	No gentleman would do that.
BRETT	I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.

LOTHER	In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
BRETT	Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
LOTHER	I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.

LOTHER	And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
BRETT	I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.

SALLY	I'm so sorry!
BRETT	Want to take it back?

SALLY	I thought you were one of my friends.
BRETT	I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
SALLY	Yes--are you?
BRETT	I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
SALLY	She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
BRETT	I'll say she is!
SALLY	Nice lines--
BRETT	Yes--

SALLY	Like her paint job?
BRETT	Very much--
SALLY	You've got lipstick all over you.
BRETT	I could stand some more--
SALLY	--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
BRETT	No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.

BRETT	Where have you been hiding?
SALLY	Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
BRETT	Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
SALLY	So you washed it off!
BRETT	How about giving me another coat?
SALLY	Good-by.
BRETT	Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
SALLY	Good-by!
BRETT	There's soft music--
SALLY	--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
BRETT	Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.

BRETT	This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
SALLY	You're not very ambitious, are you?
BRETT	Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
SALLY	You work too fast for me, young man.
BRETT	Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
SALLY	Never eat before the show.
BRETT	Well--breakfast?  Lunch?

SALLY	This is Mr.--er--
BRETT	Brett is the name.
SALLY	Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.

BRETT	Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
SALLY	You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
BRETT	Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.

BRETT	You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
SALLY	Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
BRETT	Married?
SALLY	Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
BRETT	I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
SALLY	What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
BRETT	Tell me.
SALLY	A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
BRETT	--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!

BRETT	Isn't she attractive?
SALLY	Very--your mother?
BRETT	Don't be a c-a-t.
SALLY	You asked me to dine with you tonight.
BRETT	Yes?
SALLY	Well, I can't.
BRETT	Don't rub it in.
SALLY	But I'll have cocktails with you.
BRETT	When?
SALLY	At seven-thirty?
BRETT	Sooner it you like.
SALLY	Okay.
BRETT	Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
SALLY	Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.

BRETT	See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
SALLY	I'll be there--Good-by.

SALLY	I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
BRETT	You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
SALLY	I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.

SALLY	A little.
BRETT	Sorry.
SALLY	Thanks.
BRETT	Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.

SALLY	Mighty decent of you, pal.
BRETT	Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.

SALLY	What are you thinking?
BRETT	A lot of things I'd like to forget.
SALLY	That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
BRETT	I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
SALLY	You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.

SALLY	Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
BRETT	For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
SALLY	Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
BRETT	But--
SALLY	--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
BRETT	Sally--!
SALLY	Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
BRETT	You mean that?
SALLY	Don't let's talk about it.
BRETT	You said it! How about a little action?

BRETT	Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
SALLY	Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
SALLY	This time I'm really glad you showed up.
BRETT	Lonesome?
SALLY	We'll let it go at that--

SALLY	What, again?
BRETT	Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
SALLY	What?--
BRETT	I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
SALLY	I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
BRETT	You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
SALLY	You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
BRETT	I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
SALLY	I think we ought to walk.

BRETT	Good night, Mrs. Brett!
SALLY	Good night, idiot!

SALLY	I could see you were pining away--
BRETT	Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
SALLY	Yes--I remember--

SALLY	How well do you know her?
BRETT	Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
SALLY	Who with?
BRETT	A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
SALLY	Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
BRETT	Lose?--I won a little--
SALLY	That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
BRETT	What do you know about them?
SALLY	Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
BRETT	You can live that down, can't you?
SALLY	He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!

BRETT	You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
SALLY	I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
BRETT	Come on--let's take a swim.

SALLY	I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
BRETT	Make it five.
SALLY	Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
BRETT	I'll be waiting on deck.

BRETT	I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
SALLY	Jimmy!

BRETT	Well, I'll be--!!!
SALLY	What's the matter?

BRETT	Not here--follow me around the shed.
BRETT	Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
SHORTIE	Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
BRETT	I thought you were a smart guy.
SHORTIE	If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
BRETT	We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
SHORTIE	We coulda got two third-class!
BRETT	No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
SHORTIE	Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
BRETT	It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
SHORTIE	A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
BRETT	No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
SHORTIE	I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 

BRETT	Nix, the law!
SHORTIE	Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!

BRETT	He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
SHORTIE	I'll watch for him, sir.

BRETT	Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
SHORTIE	Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.

SHORTIE	You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
BRETT	Shortie, look!

SHORTIE	You don't think--?
BRETT	Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.

SHORTIE	Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
BRETT	Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
SHORTIE	Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
BRETT	How're the tips?
SHORTIE	A dollar forty.
BRETT	I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
SHORTIE	Not a chance.
BRETT	Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
SHORTIE	Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
BRETT	Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
SHORTIE	Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.

BRETT	Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
SHORTIE	--there's thousands of 'em!
BRETT	A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!

SHORTIE	This is a business trip!
BRETT	She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
SHORTIE	Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
BRETT	Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.

BRETT	Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
SHORTIE	No, sir?
BRETT	My change.
SHORTIE	Change?
BRETT	A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.

BRETT	Shortie!--you know my motto?
SHORTIE	Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
BRETT	Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
SHORTIE	Now you're talkin'!

BRETT	Inspector McKinney.
SHORTIE	Are you screwy?
BRETT	I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
SHORTIE	You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--

BRETT	Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
SHORTIE	You take some awful chances.
BRETT	Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.

BRETT	They won't squawk--they're professionals.
SHORTIE	Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
BRETT	That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--

BRETT	Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
SHORTIE	Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.

SHORTIE	Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
BRETT	Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
SHORTIE	Thank you, sir. 
BRETT	I'll take one. 

SHORTIE	Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
BRETT	What is it?
SHORTIE	Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
BRETT	Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?

BRETT	About sixteen hundred.
SHORTIE	Partners, ain't we?
BRETT	Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 

BRETT	You keep it-- 
SHORTIE	<U>Me</U>!
BRETT	Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--

SHORTIE	Say--wait a minute!
BRETT	See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.

SHORTIE	Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
BRETT	Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
SHORTIE	Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
BRETT	Where did you hide it?
SHORTIE	On the drunk.
BRETT	Get it!

SUMMERS	Come in! 
BRETT	Hope I didn't keep you waiting.

BRETT	I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
SUMMERS	Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
BRETT	Three Jacks.
SUMMERS	That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.

SUMMERS	It's your deal.
BRETT	It's a pleasure.

SUMMERS	How's your mother feeling?
BRETT	Much better--thank you--

BRETT	Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
SUMMERS	Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
BRETT	Why isn't that a good time to quit?

SUMMERS	I thought you were a sucker--
BRETT	Think again--

SUMMERS	That goes two ways.
BRETT	Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.

MCKINNEY	I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
BRETT	Oh, yes. On the pier.
MCKINNEY	Before that. Your face is very familiar.
BRETT	Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
MCKINNEY	No--not quite.

BRETT	I'm going to the show--
MCKINNEY	I'll go with you--

BRETT	Care to join us?
MCKINNEY	No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.

BRETT	This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
MCKINNEY	Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
BRETT	It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
MCKINNEY	Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
BRETT	If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
MCKINNEY	I wouldn't be surprised--

BRETT	I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
MCKINNEY	No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
BRETT	Good night!

BRETT	Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
MCKINNEY	Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 

MCKINNEY	How about you?
BRETT	No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
MCKINNEY	You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
BRETT	Why?
MCKINNEY	Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
BRETT	Sure, I'll go.
MCKINNEY	I'll go with you.
BRETT	Swell!

MCKINNEY	It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
BRETT	How about trying your fine Italian hand?
MCKINNEY	This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
BRETT	Hey!--you're tickling me.
MCKINNEY	Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?

MCKINNEY	Hello, young fellow!
BRETT	Coming to the pool for a swim?
MCKINNEY	Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.

MCKINNEY	Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
BRETT	It's a bet--come on, Sally!

MCKINNEY	Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
BRETT	Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.

BRETT	Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
MCKINNEY	Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--

BRETT	Don't get yourself all worked up--
MCKINNEY	You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?

MCKINNEY	Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
BRETT	Why, I--

BRETT	Here's your fifty.
MCKINNEY	Thanks. That makes us square.

DENBY	Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
BRETT	Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?

DENBY	No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
BRETT	Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
DENBY	O.K. Heads you win.

DENBY	That's too bad.
BRETT	I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
DENBY	I'm sorry to hear that.

DENBY	That's all right. I'll attend to this.
BRETT	Wait a minute--let's match for it.
DENBY	Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.

BRETT	Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
DENBY	No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
BRETT	She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
DENBY	I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.

DENBY	I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
BRETT	I should say not.
DENBY	Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!

DENBY	I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
BRETT	She did?
DENBY	Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
BRETT	Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
DENBY	O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
BRETT	What's that?
DENBY	If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 

SHORTIE	Here you are, sir. 
DAN	What'll I say?

SHORTIE	Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
DAN	How?

SHORTIE	Where do you live?
DAN	In New York.
SHORTIE	Your wife knows that, don't she?
DAN	Sure.
SHORTIE	Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.

SHORTIE	Will be back in four weeks--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
DAN	That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
SHORTIE	Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
DAN	How?
SHORTIE	Will--be--back--in--four--weeks. You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
DAN	That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.

SHORTIE	Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
DAN	Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.

SHORTIE	Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
DAN	Back is in New York.
SHORTIE	Your wife knows that, don't she?
DAN	Sure.
SHORTIE	Cut it out.

SHORTIE	Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
DAN	Send that.
SHORTIE	Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
DAN	Next month is June.
SHORTIE	Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
DAN	June? That's my wife's name.
SHORTIE	That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
DAN	O.K.! Send that!
SHORTIE	Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
DAN	Sure.
SHORTIE	Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
DAN	Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.

DAN	I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
DENBY	Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
DAN	Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
DENBY	No. <U>Knots</U>!
DAN	What?
DENBY	Knots!
DAN	I can see you're no gentleman--

DENBY	That's me!
DAN	Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
DENBY	Yes--Me--in person!
DAN	So what?

DENBY	I can see where I won't talk much to you.
DAN	<U>Nuts</U> to you too!

DAN	Hello, Denby!
DENBY	I thought I put you to bed.
DAN	Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
DENBY	Well, did you find me?
DAN	Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
DENBY	This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
DAN	That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.

DENBY	Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
DAN	She's in New York.

DENBY	Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
DAN	That's fine.

DENBY	Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
DAN	Who won?
DENBY	Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
DAN	I was never stiffer in my life.
DENBY	All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--

MARY	He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
DAN	<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?

MARY	Oh, there you are--
DAN	That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
MARY	Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
DAN	Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
MARY	Never mind.

MCKINNEY	McKinney's the name.
DENBY	Miss Marsh.

DENBY	Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
MCKINNEY	Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
DENBY	Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!

MCKINNEY	You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
DENBY	Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.

MCKINNEY	Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
DENBY	It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
MCKINNEY	He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
DENBY	It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
MCKINNEY	Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 

DENBY	Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
MCKINNEY	Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
DENBY	I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
MCKINNEY	Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
DENBY	Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
MCKINNEY	Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
DENBY	Maybe he just travels in bad company.
MCKINNEY	Yeah--

DENBY	I didn't--
MCKINNEY	He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
DENBY	Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
MCKINNEY	Is this your gun?
DENBY	Yes!

SALLY	Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
DENBY	Are you happy?
SALLY	Will be--as soon as the ship sails.

SALLY	Am I a member of this club?
DENBY	You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
SALLY	Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
DENBY	Everything O.K.?
SALLY	Just what the doctor ordered.

SALLY	Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
DENBY	Like it?
SALLY	Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
DENBY	Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
SALLY	And you've put it over--haven't you?
DENBY	Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
SALLY	You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
DENBY	No--not much--excepting-- 
SALLY	Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
DENBY	No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
SALLY	I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
DENBY	Do what--
SALLY	You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
DENBY	News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
SALLY	It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
DENBY	I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
SALLY	I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
DENBY	I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
SALLY	Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
DENBY	Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
SALLY	Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
DENBY	But not nice enough to marry--eh?
SALLY	Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
DENBY	I'll never love anybody else.

SALLY	Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
DENBY	Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.

SALLY	You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
DENBY	What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
SALLY	I don't get the humor of that remark.
DENBY	<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.

SALLY	Yes.
DENBY	Very serious?
SALLY	Very--

SALLY	Why--don't you like him?
DENBY	Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--

DENBY	I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
LOTHER	What do you mean?
DENBY	Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
LOTHER	Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
DENBY	I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
LOTHER	Meaning what?
DENBY	You don't shoot squirrels.

DENBY	Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
MARY	I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
DENBY	But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
MARY	Somebody's got to do it--
DENBY	Well, let's hear the poem--
MARY	Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
DENBY	Very good, Mary--
MARY	But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
DENBY	What's the matter, Mary?
MARY	I'm getting seasick--
DENBY	H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
MARY	Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
DENBY	Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--

MARY	Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
DENBY	Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
MARY	I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
DENBY	All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
MARY	When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
DENBY	Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--

MARY	With your dry wit and humor--
DENBY	Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
MARY	Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
DENBY	What's he got that I haven't got?
MARY	Well, he has a straw hat--
DENBY	So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
MARY	--And he has sex appeal.
DENBY	So what?
MARY	Get that out of your trunk.
DENBY	All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
MARY	Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
DENBY	Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!

MARY	Is that one of the Who's Who?
DENBY	No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--

DENBY	H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
MARY	Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.

MARY	Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
DENBY	Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--

MARY	Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
DENBY	Good-night, folks.

DENBY	Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
NED	Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
DENBY	Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
NED	No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--

DENBY	What happened to you?
NED	You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
DENBY	What for?
NED	Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
DENBY	Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.

LOTHER	You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
SUMMERS	Eh?... Oh.
LOTHER	He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
SUMMERS	There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.

SUMMERS	That's him! That's the sucker!!
LOTHER	Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.

LOTHER	Can you read 'em Jack?
SUMMERS	They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
LOTHER	The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
SUMMERS	The country boy's about due.
LOTHER	Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.

SUMMERS	Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
LOTHER	Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.

LOTHER	How much did you lose?
SUMMERS	About twelve hundred.
LOTHER	I went for four.
SUMMERS	It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.

SALLY	All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
LOTHER	You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
SALLY	I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
LOTHER	It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
SALLY	Why don't you leave me alone?
LOTHER	Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
SALLY	I wish I could.
LOTHER	Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.

SALLY	You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
LOTHER	That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
SALLY	He's all right.
LOTHER	Thanks to me.
SALLY	You leave the kid alone.
LOTHER	A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
SALLY	--you'd go with him!
LOTHER	Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.

SALLY	Not because of Ned.
LOTHER	Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
SALLY	You can't bluff me any more.

SALLY	I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
LOTHER	Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
SALLY	--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
LOTHER	That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--

SALLY	Don't, Lee--that's dead.
LOTHER	Let's see if I can bring it back to life.

LOTHER	Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
SALLY	I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
LOTHER	Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
SALLY	Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
LOTHER	I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--

LOTHER	I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
SALLY	Not a chance--I'm through. 

NED	Yes, Yes!
MCKINNEY	You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
NED	No!
MCKINNEY	S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
NED	I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
MCKINNEY	Why?
NED	Because I was yellow, I guess--

NED	I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
MCKINNEY	This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?

SALLY	It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
MCKINNEY	Good night!

MCKINNEY	Congratulations.
SALLY	Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
MCKINNEY	He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
SALLY	Say, "Thanks very much!"
MCKINNEY	I mean if you knew it were stolen.
SALLY	Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
MCKINNEY	And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
SALLY	Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
MCKINNEY	Maybe you will after you've thought it over.

SALLY	That's the truth--every single word!
MCKINNEY	I sincerely hope so--
SALLY	Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
MCKINNEY	For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.

MCKINNEY	Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
SALLY	I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
MCKINNEY	I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.

MCKINNEY	Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
SALLY	He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.

PURSER	There you are, sir.
MCKINNEY	Thank you.
PURSER	Thirty one's and two ten's?

PURSER	He's certainly good-natured.
MCKINNEY	Smooth's the word.
PURSER	I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
MCKINNEY	It all depends on what you're used to.

MCKINNEY	Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
PURSER	What's the matter?
MCKINNEY	Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.

NED	I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
SALLY	Do you think Lother could have seen it?

SALLY	Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
NED	Sure, Sis.
SALLY	Aren't the roses beautiful?

SALLY	I'm all right.
NED	You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
SALLY	I was in his cabin--
NED	What!--are you crazy?
SALLY	I'll explain later--
NED	If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--

STEWARD	Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
SHORTIE	Telegrams.
STEWARD	Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.

SHORTIE	Nothin'.
STEWARD	Let me look at it.
SHORTIE	Ain't got time.
STEWARD	Hey--you! Where you going?

SHORTIE	I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
STEWARD	I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
SHORTIE	Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
STEWARD	Then why did you run away?
SHORTIE	Because you ran after me.

MOORE	The stripper's here.
ADAM	Excellent.

MOORE	She's fucking hot!
ADAM	I need a drink.

MOORE	Jesus.
ADAM	Don't touch her. Call 911.

MOORE	They'll get us on accesory to murder.
ADAM	Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...

MOORE	I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
ADAM	That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!

MOORE	Can't do what?
ADAM	We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.

SUIT	How ya doing?
ADAM	What?
SUIT	What's that?
ADAM	What did you say?
SUIT	I said how's it going?
ADAM	I didn't hear you.
SUIT	Well that's what I said.

ADAM	We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
MICHEAL	First of all...
ADAM	No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
MICHEAL	You're interrupting a personal conversation.
ADAM	Sorry Fish.

ADAM	It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
MICHEAL	Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
ADAM	No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
MICHEAL	Boyd brought up divorce statistics.

MICHEAL	You're an asshole Adam.
ADAM	You're an asshole.
MICHEAL	Oh, and why am I an asshole?
ADAM	Multiple reasons.
MICHEAL	Name one.
ADAM	I don't have to...

ADAM	Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
MICHEAL	Franco mother-fucking Harris!

MICHEAL	I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
ADAM	She's dead.

MICHEAL	We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.
ADAM	Playing?

MICHEAL	The floor was wet. She slipped!
ADAM	Why was the floor wet?
MICHEAL	I don't know why the floor was wet!
ADAM	Why?!

MICHEAL	Why?
ADAM	It's sacrilegious.

ADAM	This is pathetic.
MICHEAL	You're pathetic.
ADAM	What did you say?
MICHEAL	You're not a team player.
ADAM	Don't point at me.
MICHEAL	You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
ADAM	I have plenty of friends.
MICHEAL	The hell you do.
ADAM	The hell I don't.
MICHEAL	You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
ADAM	What are you fucking talking about?

ADAM	Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
MICHEAL	They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.

MICHEAL	About anybody but yourself. You never have.
ADAM	And you're a little fucking reject.
MICHEAL	Eat my ass!

ADAM	If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
MICHEAL	You're a loser.

MICHEAL	You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
ADAM	You fucking bastard!

ADAM	Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
MICHEAL	Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
ADAM	Go home!
MICHEAL	You go home!

BOYD	Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
ADAM	I'm not getting a ticket.

ADAM	Don't even start.
BOYD	You want to hear me out?

BOYD	One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
ADAM	You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
BOYD	I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.

BOYD	More.
ADAM	Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.

ADAM	She's got no fucking pulse.
BOYD	You don't know what you're doing.

BOYD	Wait!
ADAM	What?
BOYD	What are you doing?
ADAM	What are you talking about?
BOYD	What do you think you are doing?
ADAM	I'm calling the ambulance.
BOYD	Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
ADAM	Calling the ambulance.
BOYD	Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?

ADAM	We have to call the ambulance.
BOYD	Why?

BOYD	Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
BOYD	Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
ADAM	Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.

BOYD	Are you sure this was an accident?
ADAM	You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!

BOYD	Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
ADAM	We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
BOYD	Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
ADAM	That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
BOYD	Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.

ADAM	Stop it!
BOYD	There's more.
ADAM	Just stop.
BOYD	Just giving the facts.
ADAM	I'm calling the police.
BOYD	What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...

BOYD	Bury her out in the desert.
ADAM	Sure, why not.

ADAM	You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
BOYD	We can do this. We can get her out of here.
ADAM	Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
BOYD	Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.

ADAM	Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
BOYD	It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.

BOYD	Her fucking head was caved in.
ADAM	So I didn't fucking do it!
BOYD	She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.

BOYD	Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
ADAM	You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
BOYD	We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
ADAM	What about the blood?
BOYD	Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
ADAM	Have you ever done this before?
BOYD	The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.

BOYD	Sun rises at 5:52.
ADAM	I'm not wrecking the transmission!

ADAM	Wait. Wait a minute.
BOYD	What?
ADAM	We can't do this.
BOYD	We've already done this.
ADAM	No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.

BOYD	How do you figure?
ADAM	According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
BOYD	So that's what we're doing.
ADAM	No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
BOYD	She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
ADAM	That is absolutely not true.
BOYD	Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
ADAM	Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.

BOYD	We have to get going.
ADAM	I am not flexible on this.
BOYD	Alright. Let's do it.

BOYD	Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
ADAM	We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.
BOYD	Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.

ADAM	Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
BOYD	What does that mean?
ADAM	You got us into this mess.
BOYD	Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
ADAM	Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
BOYD	Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
ADAM	Don't talk to me about character.
BOYD	Watch the tone fella.

ADAM	Fuck you Boyd!
BOYD	Any time fat boy!

BOYD	What is your problem?
ADAM	I can't do this.

BOYD	What?
ADAM	At the seven-eleven.
BOYD	Who? What are you talking about?
ADAM	They're on me. They're smoking me out!
BOYD	Nobody's smoking anybody out.

BOYD	You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
ADAM	I don't give a damn.

ADAM	I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!
BOYD	Adam! Calm down.
ADAM	I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
BOYD	It has worked.
ADAM	I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
BOYD	They won't figure it out.
ADAM	I got children. I've got a life.

BOYD	All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
ADAM	No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.

LOIS	Don't snap at them!
ADAM	They're driving me nuts!
LOIS	They're singing.

LOIS	Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
ADAM	What?
LOIS	They're screaming for Starbursts.
ADAM	Later.
LOIS	They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.

LOIS	Where's the candy?
ADAM	There is no candy!
LOIS	What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!

FISHER	We'll be ready Adam.
ADAM	I know you'll be.  Three hours.

ADAM	That's one idea.
FISHER	No...we want padded chairs...okay?

FISHER	Real times.
ADAM	They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...

ADAM	No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
FISHER	Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
ADAM	Are you solid with that?
FISHER	No. I think it's fucked.
ADAM	Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?

FISHER	The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
ADAM	Don't ever stare him down.
FISHER	I won't do it.
ADAM	Don't eyeball your kids.

ADAM	I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
FISHER	I know and I'm honored...
ADAM	If anything ever happens to me...
FISHER	I know...
ADAM	Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...

ADAM	Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
FISHER	What happened? Oh my God...

FISHER	No way.
ADAM	It has to be done.

ADAM	I want you to hear me out.
FISHER	What.
ADAM	You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
FISHER	I don't think so.
ADAM	We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.

ADAM	Have you thought about what I said?
FISHER	Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
ADAM	I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
FISHER	I got you.
ADAM	Where's the bathroom?

LIZ	My god.
BARRY MORRIS	There's more.

LIZ	Money?
BARRY MORRIS	Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
LIZ	What does that mean?

BARRY MORRIS	Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
LIZ	Well, oh...
BARRY MORRIS	And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
LIZ	So where's that leave us?

BARRY MORRIS	So. When is the wedding.
LIZ	Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.

BOYD	What are you talking about?
LOIS	Don't sweet lip me.
BOYD	I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
LOIS	You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
BOYD	Nothing happened in Vegas.
LOIS	I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?

LOIS	Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
BOYD	Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
LOIS	Shut up Boyd! Micheal?

BOYD	He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
LOIS	I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
BOYD	Lois please.

BOYD	What is it?
RALPH	Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?

BOYD	What?
RALPH	I'm with Tina. Is she there?

BOYD	She's not here.
RALPH	Where is she?
BOYD	She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.

RALPH	Okay. Hi.
RALPH	So who's the lucky guy?
BOYD	Who?
RALPH	The groom?

BOYD	Yup.
RALPH	Doing the bachelor party thing?
BOYD	That's right.
RALPH	Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
BOYD	She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
RALPH	She's still working?
BOYD	That's right.
RALPH	Sweet deal.

RALPH	Is everything okay?
BOYD	Great. Fine. Perfect.

BOYD	She's in there!
RALPH	I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.

MOORE	No I don't.
BOYD	Fish?

MOORE	Your investment ideas never work out.
BOYD	That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.

MOORE	I don't think so Boyd.
BOYD	Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.

BOYD	But not tonight.
MOORE	Not tonight.

MOORE	Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
BOYD	Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...

BOYD	Where do you look? What side of the neck?
MOORE	Left side.

MOORE	He's right.
BOYD	We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.

BOYD	I got her arm.
MOORE	Here's his head.

BOYD	The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
MOORE	Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.

MOORE	What's your fucking point?
BOYD	I'm not talking to you?

MOORE	What's goosed?
BOYD	What is her disposition?

MOORE	He just had two.
BOYD	Give me two more.

MOORE	He's too drunk.
BOYD	He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.

FISHER	You said that Boyd.
BOYD	Well, I didn't mean it.

FISHER	Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
BOYD	Who's up for making some real money?

FISHER	Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
BOYD	Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.

FISHER	No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
BOYD	That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
FISHER	We need padded chairs.
BOYD	Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...

BOYD	She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
FISHER	I can't.

FISHER	Oh, Jesus...call the police.
BOYD	No.
FISHER	She's dead. Call somebody!
BOYD	Shut up.
FISHER	Call 911.
BOYD	Shut up.

FISHER	Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
BOYD	Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...

FISHER	Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
BOYD	Nobody knows.

FISHER	Oh God. This is insane.
BOYD	What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.

BOYD	Nobody knows she's here.
FISHER	Good God...Good God...

BOYD	All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
FISHER	I'm calling the police.
BOYD	So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?

BOYD	That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
FISHER	I think we should say some words over the grave.
BOYD	What kind of words?
FISHER	I'm talking about prayer.
BOYD	Go ahead.

FISHER	Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
BOYD	No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.

FISHER	It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
BOYD	However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?

BOYD	Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
FISHER	You always were a jealous man.

BOYD	The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
FISHER	No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...

BOYD	OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
FISHER	Shut up Boyd.
BOYD	Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
FISHER	He's having a problem here.

FISHER	Easy Boyd.
BOYD	No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?

FISHER	He's cracked up.
BOYD	He is not cracking up.
FISHER	Boyd...What have we done?
BOYD	What did you ask me?
FISHER	What?
BOYD	What is the question you asked me?
FISHER	I said, what have we done?
BOYD	Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
FISHER	I don't know! I just want to get married.
BOYD	Say it again.
FISHER	What?
BOYD	What you just said. Say it again.
FISHER	I just want to get married.
BOYD	Exactly! Exactly my point.

FISHER	What's your point?
BOYD	You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.

FISHER	Regarding what?
BOYD	Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
FISHER	No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.

FISHER	Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
BOYD	Suck my ass.

BOYD	After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
FISHER	I don't think that's such a good idea.
BOYD	Just do it.
FISHER	What are you going to do?
BOYD	Take care of business.
FISHER	What does that mean?
BOYD	And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
FISHER	I don't know...
BOYD	You got a nasty side to your thought process.

BOYD	Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
FISHER	What does that mean?

BOYD	I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
FISHER	Yeah.
BOYD	Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
FISHER	Hear what?
BOYD	That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
FISHER	Now?

BOYD	That's right.
FISHER	Isn't it a little late?
BOYD	Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?

BOYD	This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
FISHER	I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
BOYD	My what?
FISHER	You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
BOYD	You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
FISHER	I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
BOYD	Okay fine.
FISHER	Fine? Fine what?
BOYD	Whatever you say Kojak.
FISHER	I'm serious.
BOYD	I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.

BOYD	Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
FISHER	You're sick.
BOYD	And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
FISHER	Not a prayer.
BOYD	I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
FISHER	You need help.

BOYD	You're a fucking moron.
MICHEAL	It's my fucking opinion.

BOYD	The hell I did!
MICHEAL	The hell you didn't!
BOYD	The hell I did!
MICHEAL	You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
BOYD	I never heard that.

MICHEAL	Nope.
BOYD	Moore?

MICHEAL	Your ideas never work out.
BOYD	Oh really? Starbucks?

BOYD	I don't hate women.
MICHEAL	You hate women.
BOYD	False.
MICHEAL	True.
BOYD	Not true.
MICHEAL	You have a King fantasy.
BOYD	I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
MICHEAL	And what happens when you can't?
BOYD	New king.

BOYD	If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
MICHEAL	Israel doesn't have a King.
BOYD	Then what do they have?
MICHEAL	They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
BOYD	I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
MICHEAL	What's your point?
BOYD	Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
MICHEAL	The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
BOYD	There's my point exactly.
MICHEAL	What? What's your point?
BOYD	Take Mexico.
MICHEAL	What?
BOYD	Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.

BOYD	The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
MICHEAL	They need leadership.
BOYD	That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?

BOYD	A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
MICHEAL	Not really, no.
BOYD	Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.

BOYD	Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
MICHEAL	You said nobody would miss her.
BOYD	No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.

BOYD	This is going to stop right now. Right now!
MICHEAL	You will not screw this up.

BOYD	The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
MICHEAL	Ball park sausages.
BOYD	You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
MICHEAL	Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
BOYD	Easy Micheal.
MICHEAL	He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.

MICHEAL	We're goosed.
BOYD	We're not goosed.

MICHEAL	We're goosed! Goosed by God!
BOYD	Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?

BOYD	Stop it!
MICHEAL	Goosed!

BOYD	Stop.
MICHEAL	Goosed!
BOYD	Give me the Valium.

BOYD	Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
MICHEAL	How about my Fatburger?
BOYD	Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
MICHEAL	I love you.

FISHER	Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
JUDGE TOWER	All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
FISHER	Are we supposed to?
JUDGE TOWER	It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.

JUDGE TOWER	May we have the rings please?
FISHER	What?
JUDGE TOWER	The rings?

JUDGE TOWER	These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
FISHER	I do.

LIZ	This is ridiculous.
FISHER	Government cutbacks.
LIZ	Why can't we do it through the mail?
FISHER	We missed the deadline.
LIZ	Can't we do it on the phone?
FISHER	I don't think so.

LIZ	Why is this Kid staring at me?
FISHER	I'm not sure.

LIZ	Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
FISHER	I think so.
LIZ	What do you mean, you think so?
FISHER	I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
LIZ	The wedding cake check?
FISHER	Sent it.
LIZ	Photographer?
FISHER	Sent it.
LIZ	Florist?
FISHER	Yup.
LIZ	Caterer?
FISHER	Yes.
LIZ	Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
FISHER	I think I forgot the tent.
LIZ	You forgot the tent?
FISHER	I think so.
LIZ	Why?
FISHER	Why what?
LIZ	Why did you forget the tent check?
FISHER	I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
LIZ	You can't play around with these tent people.
FISHER	I'm not playing around. I forgot.
LIZ	What else have you forgot?
FISHER	How could I know what else I forgot?
LIZ	I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
FISHER	Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
LIZ	Don't you dare.
FISHER	What?
LIZ	Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...

FISHER	Stop it. I'm sorry.
LIZ	You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
FISHER	I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
LIZ	I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
FISHER	Are we going to do this again?
LIZ	I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
FISHER	I wouldn't know.
LIZ	It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
FISHER	They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
LIZ	Well it's bad timing.
FISHER	How do you figure?
LIZ	Right before the wedding?
FISHER	It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
LIZ	I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
FISHER	He is.
LIZ	He's a moron.
FISHER	He's my friend. He's not a moron.
LIZ	David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.

LIZ	Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
FISHER	What are you talking about?
LIZ	I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
FISHER	I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
LIZ	I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
FISHER	Who else?
LIZ	Charles Moore for instants.
FISHER	You don't like Moore? Since when?
LIZ	It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
FISHER	What does Moore have to do with your growing?
LIZ	I just don't see him in the big picture.
FISHER	I've known him since Cub Scouts.
LIZ	He's weird.
FISHER	He's quiet.
LIZ	He's weird.

FISHER	He just doesn't talk a lot.
LIZ	Why? What's his problem?
FISHER	He's a great chef.
LIZ	He's weird. And I expect more from you.
FISHER	You expect more what?



















FISHER	Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
L640870	u8773	m595	LIZ	Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
L640869	u8771	m595	FISHER	I'm working on it.
L640868	u8773	m595	LIZ	What's the word on the chairs?
L640846	u8771	m595	FISHER	No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
L640845	u8773	m595	LIZ	You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
L640844	u8771	m595	FISHER	I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
L640843	u8773	m595	LIZ	The chairs.
L640842	u8771	m595	FISHER	What!
L640841	u8773	m595	LIZ	What okay?
L640840	u8771	m595	FISHER	Okay.
L640839	u8773	m595	LIZ	What about the chairs?
L640838	u8771	m595	FISHER	No. Just like an hour or so.
L640837	u8773	m595	LIZ	How late?
L640836	u8771	m595	FISHER	We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
L640835	u8773	m595	LIZ	Where are you?
L640834	u8771	m595	FISHER	Hey. It's me.
L640833	u8773	m595	LIZ	Hello.
L640578	u8771	m595	FISHER	I'll see you tomorrow...
L640577	u8773	m595	LIZ	Go have fun. Not too much.
L640576	u8771	m595	FISHER	I'm mad at you.
L640575	u8773	m595	LIZ	Yeah. Nesting.
L640574	u8771	m595	FISHER	Nesting?
L640573	u8773	m595	LIZ	Just a bit of organizing.
L640572	u8771	m595	FISHER	What are you doing?
L640571	u8773	m595	LIZ	Well you should.
L640570	u8771	m595	FISHER	Well I do.
L640569	u8773	m595	LIZ	That's sweet.
L640568	u8771	m595	FISHER	I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
L640567	u8773	m595	LIZ	Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
L640566	u8771	m595	FISHER	Not yet.
L640565	u8773	m595	LIZ	Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
L640564	u8771	m595	FISHER	Hi.
L640563	u8773	m595	LIZ	Hello.
L640497	u8773	m595	LIZ	Have a nice bachelor party.
L640496	u8771	m595	FISHER	I love you.
L640495	u8773	m595	LIZ	Just call and let me know that your okay.
L640494	u8771	m595	FISHER	Of course.
L640493	u8773	m595	LIZ	Do you love me?
L640492	u8771	m595	FISHER	I will.
L640491	u8773	m595	LIZ	Will you please call the chair people?
L640481	u8773	m595	LIZ	Maybe.
L640480	u8771	m595	FISHER	We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
L640479	u8773	m595	LIZ	Take care of those chairs.
L640478	u8771	m595	FISHER	More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
L640477	u8773	m595	LIZ	Do you love me?
L640476	u8771	m595	FISHER	I'll call them from the road.
L640475	u8773	m595	LIZ	I need your help.
L640474	u8771	m595	FISHER	We're leaving in three hours.
L640473	u8773	m595	LIZ	I need your help.
L640472	u8771	m595	FISHER	Honey I don't have the time...
L640471	u8773	m595	LIZ	Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
L640470	u8771	m595	FISHER	Go down where?
L640469	u8773	m595	LIZ	You go down there.
L640468	u8771	m595	FISHER	So what do we do?
L640467	u8773	m595	LIZ	Not padded ones.
L640466	u8771	m595	FISHER	What kind of seats can we have?
L640465	u8773	m595	LIZ	We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
L640464	u8771	m595	FISHER	I'm not. What's the problem?
L640463	u8773	m595	LIZ	Keith do not trivialize this.
L640462	u8771	m595	FISHER	Okay.
L640461	u8773	m595	LIZ	Seating problems.
L640460	u8771	m595	FISHER	Problems?
L640459	u8773	m595	LIZ	We've got problems here.
L640435	u8773	m595	LIZ	Kiss me...?
L640434	u8771	m595	FISHER	With all my heart.
L640433	u8773	m595	LIZ	How much?
L640432	u8771	m595	FISHER	Of course.
L640431	u8773	m595	LIZ	Do you love me?
L640429	u8771	m595	FISHER	You will not be common!!!
L640428	u8773	m595	LIZ	I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
L640427	u8771	m595	FISHER	I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
L640426	u8773	m595	LIZ	I've seen it on television.
L640425	u8771	m595	FISHER	That's absurd.
L640424	u8773	m595	LIZ	It's vile!
L640423	u8771	m595	FISHER	Time out.
L640422	u8773	m595	LIZ	You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
LIZ	At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long...

FISHER	This is our honeymoon.
LIZ	After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...

FISHER	Yeah baby. Everything's great.
LIZ	Well, can you come back inside?
FISHER	Yeah. Sure.
LIZ	Now?
FISHER	Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.

FISHER	Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
LIZ	Are they fighting?
FISHER	No baby. We'll all be right in.

LIZ	Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
FISHER	Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
LIZ	No way.
FISHER	Can we just talk this out?
LIZ	Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...

FISHER	Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
LIZ	We're not canceling.
FISHER	I know.
LIZ	I won't even discuss it.
FISHER	No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
LIZ	I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
FISHER	Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
LIZ	Yeah. You.
FISHER	Okay. Okay.

FISHER	That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
LIZ	No.
FISHER	Yes.

LIZ	It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
FISHER	No it's not okay. It's not.

LIZ	Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
FISHER	Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
LIZ	Don't even.
FISHER	Do you love me?
LIZ	What?
FISHER	Do you love me?
LIZ	What kind of stupid question is that?
FISHER	Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
LIZ	What are you talking about?
FISHER	Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
LIZ	Who's dead?
FISHER	The prostitute.
LIZ	You fucked a prostitute?
FISHER	No Micheal did. It was an accident.
LIZ	You killed a prostitute.
FISHER	Micheal, by accident.
LIZ	Call the police.
FISHER	It's too late.
LIZ	My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
FISHER	She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
LIZ	You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
FISHER	She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
LIZ	Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
FISHER	But...
LIZ	No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
FISHER	But...
LIZ	No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!

LIZ	I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
FISHER	What money?

FISHER	He kept saying he was protected.
LIZ	What does that mean?
FISHER	Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
LIZ	Like how?
FISHER	I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
LIZ	The only proof is those bodies.
FISHER	So what do we do?
LIZ	Move the bodies.
FISHER	Move the bodies?

FISHER	I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
LIZ	You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
FISHER	What?
LIZ	If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
FISHER	No...
LIZ	You put him down or don't bother coming back.
FISHER	But...
LIZ	Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!

MR. FISHER	I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
FISHER	You did all right dad.
MR. FISHER	I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
FISHER	You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
MR. FISHER	I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
FISHER	Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
MR. FISHER	Just kills me...
FISHER	I love you dad.
MR. FISHER	I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!

MR. FISHER	Everything okay?
FISHER	Yeah, Dad. It's great.
MR. FISHER	Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
FISHER	OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.

MICHEAL	That's just insecurity.
FISHER	I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
MICHEAL	Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
FISHER	What does that mean?
MICHEAL	It means she's insecure.
FISHER	About what?

MICHEAL	Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
FISHER	I just want her to be happy.
MICHEAL	Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.

FISHER	I'm not breathing right.
MICHEAL	You're not breathing right?
FISHER	Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.

MICHEAL	I don't care for him.
FISHER	He's your brother.
MICHEAL	So?

MICHEAL	I'll take a ride.
FISHER	Go for it.
MICHEAL	Come on.

FISHER	I'm getting married...
MICHEAL	I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...

FISHER	Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
MICHEAL	Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.

FISHER	Where did you get that?
MICHEAL	At the newsstand on 3rd.

MICHEAL	Do you hear buzzing Fish?
FISHER	Buzzing?
MICHEAL	Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
FISHER	I don't hear it.
MICHEAL	Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
FISHER	Have another drink.

MICHEAL	Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
FISHER	The wahoo?
MICHEAL	The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
FISHER	The wahoo moment?
MICHEAL	That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
FISHER	I think so.
MICHEAL	I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.

FISHER	I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
MICHEAL	No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.

MICHEAL	If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
FISHER	What is it?
MICHEAL	Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.

MOORE	That ought to be about the end of that.
FISHER	Yup.

FISHER	No...No.
MOORE	How do you know she's dead.

MOORE	Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
FISHER	I got to agree with that.

FISHER	The first day.
MOORE	What?

FISHER	I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
MOORE	Did she believe you?
FISHER	I have no idea.
MOORE	You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
FISHER	Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.

MOORE	I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
FISHER	A move?
MOORE	Greenpeace.
FISHER	Greenpeace?
MOORE	Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...

MOORE	Where's Boyd?
FISHER	Downstairs in the closet.

MOORE	He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
FISHER	My God...
MOORE	He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
FISHER	Did he try to kiss you?
MOORE	All week long.

MOORE	You alright?
FISHER	Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
MOORE	I guess.
FISHER	I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
MOORE	Pup corn?
FISHER	That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.

FISHER	There.
MOORE	Where?

FISHER	Yeah?
MOORE	I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
FISHER	That's a good one.
MOORE	I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?

FISHER	I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
MOORE	That's what I'm thinking.

MOORE	Well that ought to be about the end of that.
FISHER	Yup.

JUDGE TOWER	We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
LIZ	I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?

LIZ	We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
JUDGE TOWER	Okay great. What will that be?
LIZ	We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
JUDGE TOWER	What song?
LIZ	You Send Me.
JUDGE TOWER	Oh I know that. How does it go...
LIZ	You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.

JUDGE TOWER	Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
LIZ	I do.

LOIS	...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
LIZ	...embarrassing, shameful...
LOIS	...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
LIZ	The stone age.
LOIS	The post-Vegas Man.
LIZ	A mutant species.
LOIS	Okay boys, smile!

LIZ	I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
MAGGIE	Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
LIZ	We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
MAGGIE	Take your time. I wish I had.
LIZ	We will.
MAGGIE	So where to on the honeymoon?

MAGGIE	Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
LIZ	That's our plan.
MAGGIE	Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.

MOORE	Good times.
MICHEAL	Drum banging real times.

MOORE	She's dead.
MICHEAL	It was an accident!

MOORE	Fucking desert.
MICHEAL	Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.

MICHEAL	Right.
MOORE	That's right.

MOORE	Shut up Micheal.
MICHEAL	I KILLED MY BROTHER!

MICHEAL	You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
MOORE	I don't think that's a good idea.
MICHEAL	I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?

AIDE	You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....

AMES	But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
MOSS	How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....

BREAN	We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
AMES	I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
BREAN	What's it gonna cost? 
AMES	But, but, but, "they" would find out.
BREAN	Who would find out?
AMES	...the... 
BREAN	The American "people"?
AMES	Yes

It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.

MR. YOUNG	Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.

MR. YOUNG	S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
BREAN	S'only got to hold for another few days.
MR. YOUNG	Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
BREAN	What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
MR. YOUNG	I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.

BREAN	Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
MR. YOUNG	I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?

MR. YOUNG	What's on your mind?
BREAN	I have a question for you.
MR. YOUNG	Ask it.
BREAN	Why do people go to war?
MR. YOUNG	Why do people go to war?
MR. YOUNG	I'll play your silly game.
BREAN	Why do they go to War?
MR. YOUNG	To preserve their Way of Life.
BREAN	Would you go to War to do that? 
MR. YOUNG	I have.
BREAN	Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 

CAIN	It can be documented that he displayed the...
BREAN	This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
CAIN	There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...

CAIN	...Yes.
BREAN	Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
CAIN	...Good...

CAIN	Is there a press conference today?
BREAN	What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...

CAIN	But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
BREAN	Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
CAIN	Dartmouth

BREAN	Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.

LEVY	Trade Re1ations.
BREAN	You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
LEVY	There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
BREAN	That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. <u>TIMES</u>,

LEVY	How much...?
BREAN	And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."

MOSS	Do I know you?
BREAN	We have some mutual friends in Washington.

MOSS	And you're here <u>why</u>...?
BREAN	I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
MOSS	Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.

BREAN	What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
MOSS	...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
BREAN	If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
MOSS	Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...

BREAN	What do you want the kid to say?
MOSS	Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'

BREAN	String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
MOSS	How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
BREAN	What do you think would hold it off?
MOSS	Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
MOSS	I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
BREAN	I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
BREAN	Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
MOSS	Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
BREAN	Remember the Maine...
MOSS	That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
BREAN	Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
MOSS	...uh ... No, that's...
BREAN	We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.

BREAN	It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
MOSS	Why Albania?
BREAN	Why not?

BREAN	Who?
MOSS	The... 
BREAN	They Got To Know?  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
MOSS	Is that true?
BREAN	How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
MOSS	...going to War...
BREAN	It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
MOSS	I never won an Oscar.
BREAN	N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
MOSS	Yes.  Indeed I did. 
MOSS	You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
BREAN	And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
MOSS	Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
BREAN	Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
MOSS	Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"

MOSS	...it's a Teaser!
BREAN	It's a teaser, absolutely right,

BREAN	You can't have a war without an enemy.
MOSS	No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
BREAN	Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
MOSS	Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
BREAN	W...what?
MOSS	...there gonna be any money in this thing?
BREAN	Back End ... count on it.

She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
GRACE	Better.
MOSS	You like it?
GRACE	Yes.
MOSS	Fine.  Good.

JOHNNY GREEN	It's tough to rhyme.
MOSS	I believe in you....
JOHNNY GREEN	Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.

SECOND MEDIA GUY	Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...

JOYCE	...by you?
SECOND MEDIA GUY	By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
JOYCE	Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...

MOSS	The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?
LIZ	...they... <u>you</u> know...

LIZ	Oh huh...
MOSS	...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
MOSS	And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
LIZ	I'm just talking about the Hats.
MOSS	The hats.
LIZ	A beret.
MOSS	Why a beret?
LIZ	Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
MOSS	...the special detachment... Good!  What is it?

CHINA	With Mark?

CHINA	Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
SARAH	He did?
CHINA	Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
SARAH	Businessman?
CHINA	Businessman!
SARAH	Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
SARAH	Yeah, yeah, OK

INSPECTOR ROBERTS	Weird and tiny huh?
MR LINCOLN	Hi

MR LINCOLN	Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
INSPECTOR ROBERTS	Hmm.
MR LINCOLN	Would you like a closer look?
INSPECTOR ROBERTS	It's all rather morbid though isn't it?

INSPECTOR ROBERTS	Yes, I guess you're right
MR LINCOLN	Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?

JENKINS	Your books Master Loftmore

MRS WEBSTER	No Jonathan.
JONATHAN	No?
MRS WEBSTER	She went to a waxwork party
JONATHAN	A party at a waxwork huh?
MRS WEBSTER	Can I give her a message?
JONATHAN	You don't happen to have the address do ya?

JUNIOR	Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
MARK	Uh, wrong picture Tony.

JUNIOR	I hope you enjoyed your visit.
MARK	Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
JUNIOR	Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
JUNIOR	They seemed, closing by much 
MARK	Tony and China?
JUNIOR	Vell.  Goodnight.

MARK	Haven't we been doing our homework.
SARAH	I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.

SARAH	Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
MARK	What?  Tony and China, together?
SARAH	Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
MARK	I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.

SARAH	Then why do you still like her?
MARK	Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
SARAH	I know what you mean.

SARAH	No Mark. MARK Why not?
SARAH	I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
MARK	Come on.
SARAH	No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.

MARK	No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
SARAH	That's not what you said last night.
MARK	Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
SARAH	A little?

SARAH	You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
MARK	Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
SARAH	Oh that explains everything.
MARK	You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.
SARAH	Big deal!

MARK	If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
SARAH	Who's is all this?

SARAH	Well?
MARK	Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.

SARAH	Well, it all started when a friend and I
MARK	China

MARK	Sarah listen to me.
SARAH	Go away.

MARK	I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
TONY	Forget her Mark, she's a bitch

MARK	Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
TONY	Safety in numbers man.
MARK	Right.

MARK	Anyone else not coming?
TONY	Right behind you.

TONY	This time I really don't see anyone man.
MARK	Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
TONY	This. is killer.

MARK	Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
SIR WILFRED	Hi there Sarah

MARK	No thank you sir we're fine.
SIR WILFRED	So Mark, what's so urgent?
MARK	Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them

MARK	Well?
SIR WILFRED	Well divide 18 into three
MARK	Six six and six

SIR WILFRED	If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
MARK	Sell my soul?
SIR WILFRED	Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
SIR WILFRED	You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
MARK	Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!

MARK	Can this be stopped?
SIR WILFRED	Maybe before the event, never after.

MARKS MOTHER	Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
MARK	Mom.
MARKS MOTHER	One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
MARK	They're all human beings
MARKS MOTHER	Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
MARK	Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
MARKS MOTHER	Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
MARK	Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
MARKS MOTHER	When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
MARK	But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
MARKS MOTHER	I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.

SARAH	Stop saying things so loud!
TONY	Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!

TONY	Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
SARAH	You guys are being real assholes

TONY	You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
SARAH	Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
TONY	YES!

SARAH	Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
TONY	Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.

MORGAN	:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
NICK	:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
MORGAN	:Would you stop it!
NICK	:Well, they are.
MORGAN	:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
NICK	:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
